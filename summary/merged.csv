D0901,D0901-A,"Indian and Pakistani military commanders were to discuss Wednesday Indian charges that Pakistan fired mortar shells across the border into Indian-controlled Kashmir in violation of a 14-month ceasefire.The director-generals of military operations of the nuclear-armed neighbours were slated to talk by telephone about the incident that occurred late Tuesday.""The director generals of military operations will be talking later today,"" an Indian government official said, declining to be named. ""The Pakistani side has denied firing. Let's see.""The time of the hotline call between the Indian and Pakistani officials was not immediately known.On Wednesday, Islamabad denied it had violated the ceasefire in the disputed Himalayan state of Kashmir, spark of two of three wars between Indian and Pakistan, and over which they skirmished in 2002.India and Pakistan began the ceasefire November 25, 2003, after routinely exchanging artillery fire across the volatile Line of Control, the de facto border separating their armies in Kashmir, as part of a tentative peace process.""No one from Pakistan has fired and there is no ceasefire violation by Pakistan,"" Pakistan military spokesman Major General Shaukat Sultan told AFP in Islamabad.The firing was front-page news in Indian newspapers. ""Pakistan opens fire across Line of Control,"" said The Hindu.Indian police said Tuesday at least one person was injured when about 15 mortars were fired into India from Pakistan over the Line of Control.The mortars came from across the border Tuesday evening and landed in India's Durga Post area in the Poonch sector, an Indian police spokesman said.Indian army officer Major General D. Samanwar told NDTV news channel the incident was tantamount to a ceasefire violation.""Yes, it certainly is a violation. It's the first time it has happened but we've exercised full restraint,"" he said, adding troops had been put on alert.The two sides have been engaged in formal peace talks to normalise relations since January 2004.
India's prime minister will personally flag off the first bus to travel between the Indian and Pakistan zones of divided Kashmir in almost six decades when the service resumes next month, an official said Saturday.Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to Kashmir in April will be his third since he assumed office in May.""The prime minister will be in (the Indian Kashmir summer capital) Srinagar to flag off the first bus on April 7,"" Singh's spokesman said.The bus service is the first tangible result of 14 months of dialogue between the nuclear-armed neighbours who have fought three wars including two over Kashmir, which each hold in part but claim in full.India and Pakistan agreed last month that Kashmiri residents would not need passports to cross the divided state by bus but would use permits issued by the civil administration after being cleared by police.The bus service was suspended in 1947 after the first India-Pakistan war over Kashmir. The second was in 1965.Indian Kashmir is in the grip of a 15-year-old insurgency that has so far left thousands dead.India blames Pakistan for fomenting the insurgency in Kashmir which has left at least 40,000 dead according Indian estimates, though separatists put the toll at twice that number.Pakistan denies supporting the rebels though it admits to extending moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiris' freedom struggle.Indian authorities last week said some 150 permits had been issued to applicants from Indian-Kashmir to travel by the bus linking Srinagar to Muzaffarabad, capital of the Pakistan-administered zone.Of the 150 applicants, 60 will be short-listed for the first two trips -- the first on April 7 and the second a fortnight later -- an official said.
Crying, waving and throwing letters wrapped around stones to eachother, hundreds of Kashmiris gathered on either side of a river thatseparates the disputed Himalayan region between Pakistan and India.The emotional reunion Wednesday across the Neelum River came on thefinal day of the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Fitr _ and as Indian PrimeMinister Manmohan Singh paid a rare visit to Indian-controlledKashmir, his country's only Muslim-majority state.Families separated for decades by the Kashmir conflict shoutedgreetings over the noise of the fast-flowing river. Despite easingtensions between South Asia's nuclear rivals, Kashmiris are stillforbidden from crossing the watery border.Nosheen Akhtar, 22, and her mother, Khonshad Begum, 40, burst intotears, wailed and beat their chests _ unable to meet Begum's motheron the Indian side.""I want to jump into the river. My mother is there and I cannot goover to meet with her,"" said Begum, her relatives holding her back.Authorities on both sides were restricting access to the riverside atKarin, 90 kilometers (55 miles) north of Muzaffarabad, the capital ofPakistan-held Kashmir. Indian soldiers were preventing people fromgetting too close, and on the Pakistan side, police said authoritieshad not given formal permission for the reunions.The Pakistani and Indian portions of Kashmir are separated by aheavily militarized cease-fire line where skirmishes were once commonbetween their forces. The guns have fallen silent for the past yearamid the thaw in relations, and since then there have been severalopportunities for family reunions _ albeit at a distance of 25 meters(yards) across the river.Pakistan and India both claim Kashmir in its entirety and have foughttwo wars over it since their independence from British rule in 1947.The conflict has only deepened since an Islamic insurgency began onthe Indian side in 1989. India accuses Pakistan of helping foment it,which Pakistan denies. Some Kashmiris have fled from the Indian tothe Pakistan side, accused of involvement with the rebels.On Wednesday, Singh, the Indian leader, expressed a commitment tomake peace with Pakistan, while Islamabad hailed India's withdrawalof some of India's troops in Kashmir _ a move hoped to spur the peaceprocess.But Kashmiris are impatient for progress that will allow them toreunite with relatives across the cease-fire line, known as the Lineof Control.The two countries are due to start formal talks on Kashmir nextmonth, and people on both sides are eager for a long-standingproposal for a bus service between Muzaffarabad and Srinagar, thesummer capital of Indian-held Kashmir, to finally get off the ground.""Both the countries have not been allowing us to meet,"" said RajaAzhar Khan, a 55-year-old refugee, whose wife and son live on theIndian side of the Neelum River.""The two countries are getting friendly. They are allowing people tomeet each other at Wagha (the main land border between Indian andPakistan). Why are we Kashmiris not being allowed to meet?""
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met with Kashmiri political leaders onThursday during a rare visit to the Himalayan region aimed at endinghalf a century of separatist violence that has claimed tens ofthousands of lives.Earlier, Singh offered to hold talks on Kashmir ""with anyone andeveryone"" but ruled out any redrawing of the disputed territory'sfrontier, which separates Indian- and Pakistan-controlled portions ofthe region.Singh _ on his first visit as prime minister to India's Jammu-Kashmirstate _ also announced a four-year, multibillion-dollar developmentplan he promised would result in thousands of jobs for people in theregion.Singh's two-day trip came as India began withdrawing some of itstroops on the border, a goodwill gesture to war-weary Kashmiris andrival Pakistan.On Thursday, Singh met with members of the state Cabinet to discussways to implement the economic aid package.He was also scheduled to meet with army and paramilitary forcecommanders to review a decision to reduce troops deployed in India'sJammu-Kashmir state.Although Singh's visit was largely welcomed by Kashmiris, many wereinconvenienced after security forces barricaded the main streets ofJammu, the state's winter capital, ahead of his arrival. Children andoffice workers trudged to their schools and offices after publicbuses were halted as part of the stringent security measures in thecity.Kashmir is divided between India and Pakistan but both claim theregion in its entirety. India accuses Pakistan of arming Musliminsurgents fighting for the region's independence or merger withIslamic Pakistan. Islamabad denies that.Talks with Kashmiri separatists began last year under Singh'spredecessor, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Singh indicated his governmentalso would press to end tensions with Kashmiri militants andPakistan.But Singh shrugged off a suggestion by Pakistani President Gen.Pervez Musharraf last month that some areas of Kashmir be madeindependent, placed under joint Indian and Pakistani control, or putunder United Nations administration.""Any redrawing of the international borders is not something that isgoing to be acceptable to us,"" Singh said.Singh also Wednesday addressed a rally of some 12,000 people.""I have come here with the realization and hope that I can understandwhat your aspirations and desires are,"" he said, barely visible as hespoke from behind a bulletproof screen.India has cited a decline in separatist violence as the main reasonfor its troop withdrawal, which reportedly will be about 40,000 ofthe half-million stationed in Kashmir.But a gunbattle launched by militants hours before Singh's visitunderscored the fragile security of the region. Two militants werekilled and two soldiers and a civilian wounded in the attack near therally site, security forces said.Singh announced an economic development plan for Kashmir that wouldspend 71 billion rupees (US$1.5 billion, euro1.16 billion) next year,part of a 240 billion rupee (US$5.3 billion, euro4.1 billion) outlayover four years. Some of the money will come from internationalfinancial institutions.The funds would go to building new roads and schools, and developinginfrastructure for water, power and health care. The initiatives areexpected to create 24,000 new jobs, including 14,000 for women.Creating employment for young people in Jammu-Kashmir was also apriority, Singh said, adding a ban on recruitment for government jobswill be lifted. The countrywide ban on government hiring was part ofmeasures to downsize India's bloated public sector.""The ban will not apply to Jammu-Kashmir since youth in the state arefacing hardships in getting jobs,"" Singh told a crowd of about 15,000in Jammu.
Pakistan says it would not accept the existing military line dividingKashmir as an international border, and is playing down concern thatIndia is irreconcilibly opposed to adjusting that frontier.During a rare visit to the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir,Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh offered Wednesday to hold talkson Kashmir ""with anyone and everyone,"" but ruled out any redrawing ofthe Himalayan territory's frontier.Pakistan's Foreign Ministry spokesman Masood Khan said that Singh'scomments did not necessarily represent an intractable position.""Let us not read too much into these statements because, as you cansee, we have this track of confidence-building and dialogue, andthere is no definitiveness in these statements,"" Khan told a newsconference Thursday.Singh's trip to Kashmir came as India began withdrawing some of itstroops from the region, a goodwill gesture to war-weary Kashmiris andPakistan ahead of planned talks between the nuclear armed rivals onthe problem due next month.Kashmir is claimed in its entirety by both India and Pakistan, andthe countries have fought two wars between over the territory since1947. The Indian- and Pakistan-controlled portions are separated bythe so-called Line of Control.""Any solution based on the Line of Control will not be acceptable toPakistan,"" Khan said. ""This is very clear. We are asking for asolution that is acceptable to the people of Pakistan, India and theKashmiris.""Pakistan and India began a peace process early this year, and are dueto start formal talks on Kashmir next month.In a shift in stance, Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf lastmonth suggested that some areas of Kashmir be made independent,placed under joint Indian and Pakistani control, or put under UnitedNations administration.The proposals have been greeted with little enthusiasm by India,although it has since announced its troop withdrawal.On Thursday, Pakistani Foreign Minister Khursheed Kasuri advisedIndia to avoid controversial statements, saying the relations betweenthe two nations were at a ""very delicate stage and required carefulnurturing.""""The fact is that Jammu and Kashmir is a dispute which Pakistan andIndia have to resolve through dialogue and negotiations,"" he wasquoted as saying by state-run news agency the Associated Press ofPakistan.Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz is due to make his first tripto India next week since taking office in August, and will hold talkswith Singh. Khan said the two prime ministers would discuss ""allissues.""
Pakistani and Indian officials will exchange passenger lists for a bus servicenext month across the divided Kashmir region, a Foreign Ministry official saidMonday.Pakistan and India agreed in February to re-establish a bus link between theIndian- and Pakistan-controlled portions of Kashmir as part of moves to improverelations between the two longtime rivals.The first buses between Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani Kashmir, andSrinagar, capital of Indian Kashmir, are scheduled to run on April 7 _ one buswith 30 passengers traveling in each direction.Pakistan's Foreign Ministry spokesman Jalil Abbas Jilani said Pakistani andIndian officials will on Tuesday exchange lists of passengers for the firstbuses.The passengers on the first bus route will include men and women, as well aselderly people who have not seen relatives on the other side of the frontier for50 years, he said.
CHAKOTHI, Pakistan _ Sixty-year-old Khalid Hussain hugged the brother-in-law hehad only seen before in photos after traveling from Indian- toPakistani-controlled Kashmir on the bus service revived between the dividedregion after a half-century of conflict.""We are so happy we can't express how we feel,"" Hussain said Thursday aftercrossing a narrow bridge over a rushing river that spans the military Line ofControl that cleaves the disputed Himalayan region.Minutes later he embraced his wife's brother, Asif Solaria, who lives on thePakistan side and came to meet him.Fifty-seven years of conflict has divided thousands of Kashmiri families. Somemigrated in the aftermath of the bloody partition of the subcontinent in 1947,many more fled to the Pakistani side when a separatist insurgency took hold inthe Indian portion of Kashmir in 1989.Previously, the only way to reunite was through the long and difficult processof applying for a visa to the other country _ or, during lulls in the violence,by yelling greetings across the roar of the water at the riverine frontier whenauthorities permitted it.All that changed Thursday, when two buses, carrying about 50 people in all, manyof them elderly, shuttled in each direction between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad,the capitals of the Indian and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, for 15-daystays.It was an event treated with pomp on both sides and observed with glee bythousands of Kashmiri villagers scattered on the steep mountainsides of theJehlum Valley despite storm clouds, rain and lightning. Many more lined the roadon both sides of the frontier.The bus service _ heralded by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as a ""acaravan of peace"" _ will only run once every two weeks, but it's the mostconcrete sign that a yearlong peace process aimed at burying the historic enmitybetween the nuclear-armed rival nations is bearing fruit forKashmiris.Until a year-and-a-half ago, the two armies would routinely shell each other,often killing civilians who were displaced from their homes in their thousandsby the conflict. On Thursday, white flags fluttered at either side of the ""peacebridge,"" its approaches recently cleared of land mines.The peace process has also led to resumption of trains, buses and flightsbetween India and Pakistan, but the launching of the bus link across Kashmir _severed in 1948 _ is more resonant, holding out some hope of an end to theintractable conflict over the region, which is claimed by both countries in itsentirety.India has long accused Pakistan of fomenting a separatist insurgency in Kashmirthat has left more than 66,000 people dead over the past 15 years. Pakistan saysit gives political backing to the rebels but denies giving militarysupport.The bus service was launched despite an attack Wednesday in Srinagar bysuspected militants on a government tourism complex where passengers werestaying. They traveled anyway the following day, apparently undeterred andmaking a small piece of history.""I never thought I would see this day in my lifetime,"" said Zahir Uddin, 57, ashe waited in Chakothi on the Pakistan side of the frontier for two uncles, bothaged in their 80s, who took the bus from India. ""It's taken a long time. Itshould have happened much sooner.""Raja Ferozuddin, 75, a retired government official from Muzaffarabad, wasgreeted in a village on the route to Srinagar by two of his Indian nephews aftercrossing from Pakistan. The three kissed and wept with joy as they held eachother.""I was eight years old when I left this place,"" Ferozuddin said. ""All this hashappened very late in my life. I want to embrace all this into my heart _ thetrees, the hills, the rocks.""____Eds: Associated Press Writer Mujtaba Ali Ahmad in Salamabad, India, contributedto this report.
The leader of moderate Kashmiri separatistswarned Thursday that lasting peace between India and Pakistan would beimpossible unless his people were seated at the negotiating table.During more than a year of talks with Pakistan, India has refusedto let Kashmiri leaders have a direct role in deciding possiblesolutions to the 57-year conflict over Kashmir.Kashmiri leader Mirwaiz Omar Farooq insisted Thursday that``historic realities,'' such as a guerrilla war against Indian rulethat began in 1989, meant three-way talks were the only way to end thedispute over the divided territory.``Kashmiris have expressed themselves in red-hot blood for the last15 years, and this reality cannot be ignored, neither by India norPakistan,'' said Farooq, who heads a loose alliance of separatistgroups called the All Party Hurriyat Conference.``So if anybody believes that you can have a bilateral agreement onKashmir, they are highly mistaken.''The official death toll in the Kashmir insurgency is more than45,000, but Kashmiris say the real number is more than twice that.Almost 1,600 people have died in the conflict this year. Indianauthorities said about half the dead were militants, 456 werecivilians and 269 were members of the security forces.In January, former Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee'sgovernment began the first talks with Kashmiri separatist leaders, buttwo rounds of discussions showed little progress.Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has been slow to resumenegotiations with Kashmiri leaders since defeating Vajpayee in Mayelections.Singh repeated here Wednesday that Kashmir is part of India andinsisted any peace deal with Pakistan could not redraw internationalborders or divide Indian territory along religious lines. Kashmirileaders feared those were new condset out specific proposals for negotiation.A third round of talks with India's government can't start until itagrees to let Kashmiri leaders visit Pakistan to discuss peaceproposals with its government and guerrilla commanders in the part ofKashmir under Pakistan's control, Farooq said.``Both things have to be addressed,'' he told reporters here, afterinsisting Hurriyat leaders were not setting conditions for resumingnegotiations.Farooq said Hurriyat leaders would travel to New Delhi next week tomeet Pakistan's Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, who is expected todiscuss new efforts to advance a peace process that began last year.According to Farooq, Aziz plans to discuss recent proposals byPresident Pervez Musharraf for a settlement, which included grantingautonomy to the divided region and putting parts of it under jointrule by India and Pakistan.After hearing Kashmiri leaders' views, Aziz will formally presentthe proposals to India's government, said Farooq, who calledMusharraf's suggestions ``a step in the right direction.''``The Hurriyat has three road maps for resolving the Kashmirissue,'' Farooq said, without providing details. ``And we are ready todiscuss all three, with both the Indian and Pakistan governments, sothat a way forward can be charted that is acceptable to all.''
The prime ministers of India and Pakistan plan to meethere Wednesday in an effort to find new grounds for compromise in thelong-running conflict over Kashmir.Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz arrived here Tuesday on atour of regional capitals as head of the South Asian Association forRegional Cooperation, which promotes closer economic ties within theregion.Aziz has said he will use his visit with Indian leaders to seekprogress in peace efforts that began last year.Both countries have hinted that Aziz's meeting with Indian PrimeMinister Manmohan Singh may produce agreement on opening bus servicebetween the Indian- and Pakistani-controlled sections of Kashmir forthe first time in 57 years of conflict over the Himalayan territory.The two countries also are said to be near a deal on a $4.2 billionpipeline to deliver natural gas from Iran to India through Pakistan.Aziz's two-day visit comes amid mixed signals from India andPakistan on their willingness to compromise on Kashmir. Afterinsisting for months that they were ready to give up entrenchedpositions and make lasting peace, leaders of both countries in recentdays have repeated hard-line views on the disputed region.Indian security forces said they were winning a war against theseparatists in Kashmir, which began in 1989. Pakistani PresidentPervez Musharraf insisted again last week that the guerrillas werefreedom fighters acting without anything but moral support from hiscountry.The Indian military says so far this year it has blocked about 60attempts by militants to infiltrate Indian-held territory from thePakistani side. The number climbed in recent weeks as Musharrafpressed Singh to move more quickly on negotiations over Kashmir.``Let me tell you that I have no reason to believe that there hasbeen any lack of effort in infiltration attempts from across theborder,'' India's chief of army staff, Gen. Nirmal Chander Vij, saidMonday. ``During the current month alone, there have been eight suchattempts, including two taking place during the last two to threedays.''After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the United States pressuredPakistan to rein in the militant groups, several of which were alliesof the al-Qaida network. But as the guerrillas lose their strength,Pakistan loses leverage on the Kashmir issue.India tightened the noose around the insurgents by completing a12-foot-high fence this year that runs 340 miles along itsinternational border with Pakistan and a 1972 cease-fire line, or Lineof Control, that divides the disputed region between the two.(Begin optional trim)When the British pulled out of the subcontinent in August 1947,they told the Indian princes, including the Hindu maharajah who ruledthe mainly Muslim territory of Jammu and Kashmir, to choose betweenjoining India or Pakistan. As the king delayed, the two neighboringnations went to war over the region in October of that year, and ithas been divided since.Within days of the war, the maharajah chose India, but Pakistan haslong insisted that he did so under pressure and that the people ofKashmir should be allowed to decide their fate in a binding referendumpromised in a 1948 United Nations Security Council resolution.(End optional trim)Musharraf is the first Pakistani leader to publicly suggest thatthe dispute might be resolved without a vote by Kashmiris -- if Indiamakes significant concessions. But he also has suggested that India ishardening its position.Last week, Musharraf revived Pakistan's demand for the plebiscite,in the face of New Delhi's continued claim that Kashmir was itsterritory and that India's boundaries could not be redrawn.Pakistan will only drop its demand for a vote ``if India isprepared to show flexibility,'' Musharraf told an interviewer lastweek, adding that ``at the moment ... we don't see that.''
Markets are overcrowded, traffic jam is heavy and the shops arejostling with shoppers in the capital city of Srinagar in theIndian-administered Kashmir as the holy Moslem festival of Eidapproaches here.Kashmiris are known as incorrigible festive shoppers and because ofthat reputation, unscrupulous shopkeepers have been minting money byover-charging the locals for everything from a chop of mutton to thechickens and hosiery items that the locals must buy to protectthemselves from the biting cold of the winter.But, around this Eid festival, there is more to the happy public moodthan just the urge to over spend during the festival.Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who arrives here on a two- dayvisit next week, announced on Thursday that orders had been given forthe reduction of troops inside Kashmir.This measure has obviously been taken to take care of the buildingtensions between the Indian army and local people who often come intounpleasant contact during encounters, crackdown operations and searchand cordon exercises that have become so routine in Kashmir eversince the present armed struggle against the Indian rule started here18 years back.It must also be mentioned that the Indian army on Friday suspendedand took into custody an officer who had been accused of having rapeda woman and her daughter in a north Kashmir village last week.It is, therefore, clear that the Prime Minister's decision has notbeen influenced by any dramatic improvement in the ground situation.Coinciding with the announcement made in the Indian capital NewDelhi, Indian paramilitary police was battling it out with twosuicide guerrillas that forced entry into their camp in Srinagar' sDalgate area on the banks of the Dal lake that is regarded as one ofthe most secured places in Kashmir and the hub of the touristactivity in Kashmir.Interestingly, Indian Home Minister Shivraj Patil, who had recentlyvisited Kashmir for three-days, told reporters in Delhi that he wasyet to submit his report to the Prime Minister about his perceptionsof the ground situation in Kashmir.Patil was obviously trying to suggest that the Prime Minister Singhhad taken the decision to reduce the troops inside Kashmir on hisown.Kashmir is a very tricky situation. One grenade blast can put thingsback by months here. That is why the prime minister has said thattogether with the reduction in the number of troops in Kashmir, therewould be no lowering of vigil.This also is the reason that many locals believe the Indiangovernment is acting under international pressure. Interestingly,Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf had recently put forth a newformula on Kashmir that was seen as a climb down from the previousPakistan position on Kashmir. Significantly, Musharraf had suggestedwithdrawal of Indian troops from Kashmir region.Does this mean that both Musharraf and Singh are simply trying toplay roles that have been scripted for them by the internationalcommunity?For most Kashmiris who have been fed up with the stiffening of Indianand Pakistan approaches on Kashmir, this appears to be the rightargument. And that has given them new hope to celebrate theforthcoming Eid with more joy and confidence.It is possible the solution ahs already been drafted and both Indiaand Pakistan are slowly but surely moving in that direction step bystep so that the people of the two countries are not taken bysurprise when the final agreement is signed, said Samad Sheikh, 71, avillage headman in Kashmir.For Kashmiris the recent developments and the fact that the bilateralceasefire on the borders between the two countries was holding forthe last one year are indications that their troubles might soon end.
","Since they became separate nations in 1947, India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, 
the Himalayan province which was split between them. Kashmir is India's only majority Islam province,
 and an Islam insurgency began on the Indian side in 1989. More than 45,000 people were killed. 
 A bilateral cease fire was pronounced in 2003, and Prime Minister Singh of India reduced troop levels by 40,000 
 in a force of 500,000. Peace talks began in 2004 and in March 2005, bus service between the two countries began,
  the first tangible result of the peace talks. ","During November 2004, India's prime minister reduced troops on the Kashmir border as a goodwill gesture prior to his visit. While there, he met with Kashmiri separatist leaders. India rejected a Pakistani suggestion that some Kashmir areas be made independent, placed under joint control, or put under UN administration. The Indian and Pakistani prime ministers were to meet in New Delhi to further the peace process begun in January and facilitated by a year-long ceasefire. Consequently, on April 7, 2005, limited bi-weekly bus service between the Indian- and Pakistani-controlled sections of Kashmir resumed for the first time in 57 years. ","A border ceasefire begun November 25, 2003 has held. The US pressured Pakistan to control militant groups. India's early 2004 talks with Kashmiri separatists showed little progress. India and Pakistan were to start formal talks on Kashmir in December. Pakistani President Musharraf suggested making Kashmir autonomous or putting parts under joint India/Pakistan or UN control. Indian PM Singh committed to making peace with Pakistan but rejected redrawing the border. India withdrew some border troops. Singh visited Kashmir three times and announced a Kashmiri economic development plan. Bus service between the Indian and Pakistani zones started in April 2005. ","There appears to be progress in the Indian-Pakistani dispute over Kashmir. The bilateral ceasefire has held for a year. The Indian Prime Minister met with Kashmiri political leaders for the first time. India has reduced the number of border troops and announced a multibillion-dollar development plan. Bus service has been opened for the first time in 57 years. The Pakistani President has suggested three solutions: Some areas of Kashmir could be made independent or placed under joint Indian-Pakistani control or put under UN administration. However, India has ruled out division along religious lines or redrawing international borders. "
D0901,D0901-B,"The first trans-Kashmir bus in decades has rolled and dozens of families have been reunited across the divide, but real progress by nuclear-rivals India and Pakistan on their core dispute over Kashmir remains a long way off, analysts say.""We basically see this as one of the confidence-building measures,"" said Ajai Sahni of the New Delhi-based Institute of Conflict Management.""We must understand that for Pakistan, none of the fundamentals have really altered in terms of intent or claim.""The first bus service spanning divided Kashmir in nearly 60 years ran simultaneously Thursday from Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian Kashmir and Muzaffarabad, capital of the Pakistan-administered zone.Passengers crossed the heavily-militarised Kashmir frontier despite attempts by militants on the Indian side to derail the historic journey with a blast along the route and an attack a day earlier on a guesthouse complex in Srinagar where the passengers were staying.At the end of the day, 30 people travelled the 160-kilometre (100-mile) route from Muzaffarabad while 19 -- down from an original 29 -- went in the opposite direction.They were greeted with sweets and garlands by thousands of people when they arrived on the other side, while members of divided families hugged each other with tears rolling down their cheeks.""All these measures can easily be reversed the moment the circumstances are altered for Pakistan,"" Sahni said. ""And President (Pervez) Musharraf has made this abundantly clear when he says that unless Kashmir is solved, there can be more Kargils.""Indian and Pakistan-backed intruders fought a short duration conflict in the high mountains of Kargil sector of Kashmir in 1999. Nearly 1,000 combatants on both sides were killed.I.A. Rehman, director of the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, sounded a similar cautionary note.""It was good that despite the fire and the shooting the buses reached their destinations and the two governments did a splendid job,"" he told AFP in Islamabad.""(But) it does not mean that there are no hurdles left. There is a long way to go, but the road to peace is getting clear.""Kashmir was divided between India and Pakistan after a 1947 war but it is claimed in full by both countries.Family members separated by the division of the picturesque Himalayan region have longed to meet each other again but have had to take a long roundabout route which also depended on being granted hard-to-get visas by New Delhi or Islamabad.Though the bus has been hailed as a powerful symbol for peace by the media and analysts on both sides, there is little dispute that the event marks only a small step on the long road to rapprochement for the nuclear rivals, who have fought three wars -- two over Kashmir -- and came close to a fourth in 2002.Senior Pakistani defence analyst, retired brigadier Abdur Rehman Siddiqui, however said the bus service was here to stay.""It may not be as historic as the fall of Berlin Wall, but something close to it ... It's not only symbolic but this confidence building measure is irreversible,"" he said.Tauseed Ahmed, professor of Mass Communication at Federal Urdu University, said: ""It is good to see buses of peace and not tanks or guns en route to Kashmir.""It's good to see friends meeting friends, families meeting families without any feeling of hatred,"" he added.""The forces of peace may replace the forces of hatred if more people started travelling, he said, but warned that hostile elements may again try to sabotage the process.""Give peace a chance and the Kashmir issue can be resolved,"" Ahmed said.Indian analyst Sahni believes the bus has indeed taken forward the slow-moving peace process between India and Pakistan which began in January last year and has improved the atmosphere before Musharraf's scheduled visit to New Delhi next weekend.Musharraf is due to watch a one-day cricket match between India and Pakistan on April 17. He will also hold talks with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh -- their first formal talks since Singh became premier last May.
The moderate wing of Indian Kashmir's main separatist alliance said Monday it will meet Pakistan President Pervez Musharraff when he visits New Delhi this weekend, local media reported.The All Party Hurriyat Confererence has been pushing for its inclusion in a formal peace proceess between nuclear rivals India and Pakistan aimed at ending the long festering dispute over the divided Himalayan region of Kashmir.The Hurriyat said it would discuss Tuesday in Srinagar, the main city of Indian Kashmir, its strategy for the meeting with the Pakistani president, the Press Trust of India news agency reported.Musharraf is coming to New Delhi to watch the final one-day cricket match of a series between the two countries and meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to push forward the peace process.""We will be meeting Musharraf on April 16. This has been verbally communicated to us,"" the chairman of the moderate wing, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, told the Press Trust of India. It gave no further details.Both the moderate and hardline factions of Hurriyat have welcomed the peace process launched in January 2004 between the neighbours which have fought three wars, two over divided Kashmir that both claim in full.But separatist leaders say at some point they must be included in the discussions on Kashmir's future in a ""triangular dialogue."" India, however, wants a bilateral solution while Pakistan wants the separatists' involvement.Indian security forces have been fighting since 1989 to suppress a deadly revolt against New Delhi's rule in Indian Kashmir.The Pakistani president said on the weekend he was more interested in discussing the future of Kashmir with Indian leaders than being a spectator at the cricket game set for Sunday.Musharraf's trip will just come just over a week after the launch of a historic bus service linking the Indian and Pakistan zones of Kashmir.Musharraf has said the bus service cannot resolve the Kashmir issue but is a ""step towards confidence building"".Meanwhile, The Hindu newspaper quoted Farooq as saying he wants to take the bus to meet Kashmiri leaders in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.""A sincere political dialogue should start now between the political leaders on both sides ... and a visit by Hurriyat leaders would go a long way in the convergence of ideas for an amicable solution,"" he said.India invited Musharraf to attend one of the matches on Pakistan's first full tour of India in six years after the Pakistani leader said he wanted to watch a cricket match in India.Musharraf's visit to India will be the first since a summit in the northern city of Agra in 2001 with then prime minister Atal Behari Vajpayee collapsed over Kashmir dispute.
Suspected Muslim rebels killed three policemen, a state political party member and two others in the first attacks on police in Kashmir since Indian and Pakistan leaders met two week's ago, police said Thursday.The three policemen, one an officer, were killed in the summer capital Srinagar and northern Baramulla district overnight, a police spokesman said.""The officer was brought out of his house by suspected militants and killed by slitting his throat,"" he said of the officer killed in Baramulla.Two other officers were shot dead -- one inside his house and the other while on duty near Kashmir's central jail in Srinagar.No group claimed responsibility for the killings, the first of security force personnel since Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Pervez Musharraf held talks in New Delhi two weeks ago.The two countries launched a peace process 15 months ago and after their talks in New Delhi described it as ""irreversible.""The officer's slaying sparked a protest demonstration in the Nishat area of the city, with people demanding action against killers, residents said.In other violence, suspected rebels Thursday shot dead a member of the state's ruling Peoples Democratic Party, Yasin Magray, at a busy bus stand in southern Kulgam town, 70 kilometers (43 miles) south of Srinagar, the spokesman said, adding a student was injured in the shoot-out.Police said suspected rebels also shot dead a former colleague and a Muslim labourer in two separate incidents in the neighbouring district of Pulwama.The rebels often target pro-India politicians and people they suspect of working for Indian troops.Thousands of people have died in Kashmir since the launch of armed insurgency in the Himalayan region in 1989.
Moderate separatist leaders from Indian Kashmir returned home Thursday from a historic trip to Pakistan in upbeat mood, saying they were ready to hold a new round of talks with New Delhi on the future of the troubled Himalayan region.The eight leaders, who have been on a two-week visit to Pakistan, arrived on the new bi-monthly trans-Kashmir bus service at Kaman Post, on the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border dividing mainly Muslim Kashmir between India and Pakistan, early afternoon.They were to continue their journey to Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian-administered Kashmir, in a motorcade under tight security by India's security forces.""It's been a very successful trip for us,"" said Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, leader of the moderate faction of Kashmir's main separatist alliance, the All Parties Hurriyat Conference.""We're ready for talks with New Delhi but it's for them to decide when they want to talk,"" Farooq told AFP shortly after crossing back into the Indian zone of the divided territory.New Delhi had previously forbidden separatist leaders from travelling to Pakistan and refuses negotiate with them, despite a peace process launched by India and Pakistan in 2004.The South Asian rivals have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir, which they each hold in part but claim in its entirety.The moderates, who are demanding that Kashmiris be included in talks between India and Pakistan on resolving their decades-old dispute on Kashmir, held two meetings with India's government early in 2004 but the talks stalled when the Congress party won power in elections last May.""The biggest benefit from the trip is that Kashmiris are being accepted as a party to the dispute,"" Farooq said.Separatist leaders in Indian Kashmir seek a three-way dialogue with the Indian and Pakistan governments to sort out the region's future.""Our triangular approach has been appreciated in Pakistan and in Pakistan-administered Kashmir,"" Farooq added.During their visit, the Hurriyat leaders held talks with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, and a host of other leaders, including Syed Salahuddin, chief of a broad alliance of groups battling Indian rule in Muslim-majority Kashmir.""We spoke to Syed Salahuddin about how to consolidate the ongoing peace process,"" Farooq said.Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf said Thursday during a trip to Australia that there was ""light at the end of the tunnel"" in the dispute but warned flexibility was needed on both sides to resolve the issue.The insurgency against Indian rule in Kashmir has left more than 40,000 people dead by official count. Separatists say the toll is twice as high.
India and Pakistan Wednesday agreed to start a bus service in October linking two cities on either side of their only border crossing as part of an ongoing peace process, an official here said.The agreement came after two days of talks in the Indian capital. It will be only the second bus service crossing India and Pakistan's international border.""The trial run of the Lahore-Amritsar bus service being operated by both sides will take place in the second half of October 2005 with a view to starting regular bus service in the first half of November 2005,"" Dilip Sinha, a joint secretary at the Indian foreign ministry, read from a joint statement.In April, India and Pakistan agreed on the first bus service to link divided Kashmir in almost 60 years as part of a peace process begun in January 2004.But the service, which crosses the ceasefire Line of Control separating the Indian and Pakistan zones of the Himalayan state, has been opposed by some separatist groups as well as by Islamic rebels fighting Indian rule in the disputed region.The Lahore-Amritsar bus, covering 45 kilometres (28 miles), will link the two countries via the only international land crossing at Wagah in the state of Punjab, divided between India and Pakistan at partition in 1947.A bus service linking New Delhi and Lahore, originally started in 1999 by former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee but suspended after a 2001 attack on India's parliament by suspected Pakistan-backed militants, was restarted in July 2003.The two sides also said Wednesday they would hold further talks on a proposed bus service between Amritsar and the Pakistani town of Nankana Sahib, the site of a Sikh shrine near Lahore.The bus services are part of broader efforts by nuclear-armed neighbors India and Pakistan to normalise relations after coming to the brink of war after the parliament attack.Both sides agreed in January last year to enhance economic, transport and cultural links while working to resolve a dispute over Kashmir, the cause of two of their three wars since indepndence.
Pakistan and India were due to hold meetings of a long-dormant joint economic body for the first time in 16 years Tuesday, marking a further thaw between the South Asian rivals, officials said.Senior Indian diplomat Shyam Saran said the commission would discuss steps to promote trade ties between the nuclear-armed neighbours, who have fought three wars, two of them over the Himalayan region of Kashmir.""This will be the first meeting of the joint commission after a gap of 16 years. This is a very significant event for our two countries,"" Saran, the senior official in the Indian foreign ministry, told reporters late Monday.""Our trade and economic relations are improving,"" he said, noting that Pakistan recently used their land border to import basic foods including onions, garlic and potatoes from India.The decision on the economic commission was reached Monday during Indian Foreign Minister Natwar Singh's talks with his Pakistani counterpart Khurshid Kasuri to review progress on the peace process between the two countries.India and Pakistan also signed deals under which they agreed to notify each other in advance on ballistic missile tests and to set up a hotline between their coastguards.Both nations routinely test nuclear-capable missiles but for the past few years they have always given prior notice despite the lack of a formal agreement.The coastguard hotline deal would lead to early exchange of information between the two sides on arrests of fishermen who inadvertently stray into rival waters, the statement said.The peace process was launched in early 2004 to resolve eight issues including the dispute over the Muslim-majority Himalayan state of Kashmir, which is divided between Indian and Pakistan and claimed in full by both.In symbolic, confidence-building gestures, the two countries have started a cross-border bus service in Kashmir and resumed sporting ties, but progress has been sluggish on central problems such as Kashmir itself.Saran said both sides were committed to finding a ""mutually acceptable"" solution to Kashmir but ruled out any change in borders.The Islamabad foreign ministers meeting follows a summit in September between Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in New York that ended without any major initiatives.
India and Pakistan on Wednesday agreed to expedite the opening of bank branchesin each other's country and improve air and shipping services, a governmentstatement said.Commerce Ministry officials from both countries met Tuesday and Wednesday todevise a roadmap for economic cooperation and review progress made in easingcustoms rules and non-tariff barriers since the trade talks were launched a yearago.Both countries have lifted some trade barriers and allowed goods to be shippedby road between them after a gap of nearly five decades. Officials would meetsoon to formulate recommendations to further ease non-tariff barriers andenhance customs cooperation and trade, the statement said.""Requests for opening of bank branches in both countries would be processedexpeditiously to facilitate bilateral trade relations,"" it said.Indian and Pakistani banks had branches in each other's country until theyclosed in 1965 when the rivals fought one of the three wars between them sincethey gained independence from Britain in 1947.The statement also said that talks to review the existing air services agreementand the shipping protocol would be held in September.A fiber optic link to improve telecommunications between the neighboringcountries would be established soon, the statement said.Economic ties between India and Pakistan improved after peace talks began lastyear. Trade between them totaled US$600 million in the year that ended in March_ double the annual average for the past decade, said India's Commerce Ministryspokeswoman, Shipra Biswas.But that's still only about 0.5 percent of the value of trade the two nationscarry on with the rest of the world each year.Business leaders say there is vast potential for expanding commercial tiesbetween India and Pakistan, which together have some 1.2 billion people. Thegrowth of cross-border trade, however, has been stunted by their five-decadedispute over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which both nationsclaim.
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has invited Kashmir's separatists for peacetalks _ a move that could boost efforts to end India and Pakistan's decades-olddispute over the Himalayan region.Singh offered to hold talks on Sept. 5 with the moderate faction of Kashmir'smain separatist alliance, the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, the primeminister's spokesman, Sanjaya Baru, said WednesdayAn agreement with the separatists is crucial to pushing forward the peaceprocess between India and Pakistan. Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority state inpredominantly Hindu India, is split between the two countries, but both claimall of it.The talks come ahead of a planned meeting on Sept. 14 between Singh andPakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf in New York on the sidelines of theU.N. General Assembly.Despite improved relations in the last two years, India and Pakistan have madefew moves toward resolving the dispute over Kashmir, which lies at the core oftheir rivalry and was the cause of two of three wars fought by the neighborssince their independence from Britain in 1947.The leader of Hurriyat, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who will head the Kashmiridelegation, said the talks in New Delhi should help push Kashmir to theforefront of the Indian-Pakistan peace process.""The cycle will be complete now. India is talking to Pakistan, Pakistan talks tous and we talk with India,"" he said.Farooq was one of nine separatist leaders who traveled to Pakistan in June andmet with Musharraf to discuss Kashmir.There was no immediate reaction from Pakistan.Kashmir is ""a complicated issue, but it can be resolved if there is sincerityand commitment of all parties involved,"" he said. ""If we can build trust andconfidence, the Kashmir dispute can be resolved.""In Washington, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the U.S.government welcomed discussions that would relieve tensions overKashmir.""We encourage those discussions and they're continuing to take steps that buildup trust and confidence to address the differences they have on this issue,"" hetold reporters.India's previous government, led by Hindu-nationalists, held two rounds of talkswith the Kashmiris in 2004, although little progress was made beforeparliamentary elections later that year brought Singh's Congress party topower.Since then, government officials have been in contact with Hurriyat leadersthrough mediators, Baru said.During the 2004 talks, Hurriyat leaders demanded the government release some 500activists held as political prisoners in Indian jails, and some have since beenfreed.Farooq said he did not expect substantive discussions on Sept. 5, when theexchanges would mostly be introductory.Jammu-Kashmir's elected head, Chief Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed, said heexpects the meeting would pave the way for a wider dialogue that will be joinedby hard-liners, many of whom support a violent insurgency to wrest Kashmir fromIndia. They have so far ignored the government's call for talks.Saifudin Soz, a Kashmiri lawmaker who is helping arrange the talks, said ""anoverwhelming majority of Kashmiris _ tired of violence _ will welcome thetalks.""The Hurriyat has been demanding Kashmir's independence since the region wassplit months after India and Pakistan were partitioned into independentcountries by the British.The campaign turned violent in 1989, and there are now more than a dozen rebelgroups fighting in India's portion of Kashmir. The insurgency has killed morethan 66,000 people, most of them civilians.Moderates, such as Hurriyat leader Farooq, have denounced theinsurgency.
Of all the signs the India-Pakistan peace process is producing tangibledividends, one stands out: Kashmir is running low on chickens.Chickens are the key ingredient in the traditional Kashmiri wedding feast, andwith the Indian-Pakistan peace process producing the region's most peacefulsummer since the start of Kashmir's Islamic insurgency in 1989, this year'swedding season is among the most festive in years.Kashmir lies at the heart of the India-Pakistan rivalry _ the neighbors havefought two wars over the predominantly Muslim region, which is split betweenthem but claimed by both.On Wednesday, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pakistani PresidentPervez Musharraf said they would continue to pursue peace in Kashmir aftermeeting on the sidelines of a U.N. summit in New York.""Our nations must not remain trapped by hate and history, in a cycle ofconfrontation and conflict,"" Musharraf said Wednesday in an address to the U.N.General Assembly. ""For this to happen, it is essential to find a just solutionto the problems of Jammu-Kashmir.""It's statements like that which have Kashmiris again celebrating late into thenight _ swaying to soulful old wedding songs at parties that often have morethan 1,000 guests.""Weddings were not as much fun a couple of years ago as they are now _ one can'tenjoy if one lives in fear,"" said Aijaz Banday, a 42-year-old banker. ""A lot haschanged over the past few years. You couldn't imagine staying out and partyingso late in those days.""Tourists, most of them Indians, are also back in record numbers _ 600,000 so farthis year with two more months of the season left. Those are the highest numberssince 1989, and almost twice the number of arrivals last year.And everyone is eating chicken.""There is a big shortage of chicken. I am getting frantic calls,"" said RiazAhmed, owner of Shaan Poultry in Srinagar.To meet the soaring demand, Ahmed is trying to order chickens from other partsof India.But the supplies must meet the approval of finicky Meraj-ud-Din, the latest in along line of legendary Kashmiri chefs who have for generations preparedtraditional weddings feasts of up to 40 courses, known as a ""wazwan.""Wazwan platters _ each shared by four people _ include succulent pieces of lamb,rice and vegetables and are crowned by at least one whole chicken thatMeraj-ud-din demands weigh between one kilogram (2.2 pounds) and 1.5 kilograms(3.3 pounds). Heavier or lighter birds would look too small or too big on theplatter, he says.Less violence means more festive wazwans.""There are so many weddings this season, Kashmiris will be eating out all ofthis month. There is great pressure,"" said Ahmed, the chickenseller.The number of attacks in Jammu-Kashmir was down by 25 percent from January toJuly compared to the same period last year, dropping from more than 1,600 tojust over 1,200, officials have said. More than 66,000 people have died sincethe start of the insurgency.""This has been a far better summer than many summers before,"" said PoliceInspector-General Javed Makhdoomi. ""The atmosphere has changed. People feel moresecure and safe.""With Kashmiris feeling safer, another wedding tradition has also been revived _the stopping of wedding caravans on the first bridge they cross so the driver ofthe bride and groom's car can be paid a customary fee for crossing the span. Thegroom pays the fee.In years past, stopping long lines of cars on the iron and wooden bridges ofSrinagar, Indian Kashmir's summer capital, would be strictly forbidden byskittish Indian soldiers who feared the vehicles could be packed withexplosives.These days, however, soldiers stand aside and watch the ceremonies, whichinvolve feverish honking, cheering and clapping on car-chokedbridges.""These days I am reminded of my childhood, when I went to weddings holding myfather's hand,"" said Mohammed Zakariya, 31, a trader. ""But all these years,having fun at weddings became impossible.""In a land riven by sorrow, some small joys are returning.
Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf Monday said nobody will be allowed to disrupt the Indo-Pak peace process, according to New Delhi TV (NDTV).Musharraf, who met Indian editors over breakfast at New Delhi'sTaj Man Singh Hotel, said that India and Pakistan have approached all issues with sincerity.Giving a call for creating a consensus on the Kashmir issue, Musharraf said the Kashmir issue should be resolved amicably. He said the Line of Control (LoC) and soft border cannot be accepted as the solution.Musharraf said he had come to India with a renewed mindset and had achieved more than he had expected. He added that the talks between the Indian and Pakistan officials were for harmony and goodwill.Musharraf also said that an ""out of the box"" solution has to befound with regard to Kashmir which is acceptable to India, Pakistan and the people of Kashmir.The Kashmir ""dispute"" has to be resolved and it needs analysis,and the two countries have to move forward on it, Musharraf said.Asserting that the terrorist attack to derail the bus service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad was not acceptable, Musharraf said a decision has been taken and the peace process cannot be allowed to be disrupted.Musharraf asserted that unless the Kashmir ""dispute"" was resolved it can ""erupt"" in the future under ""different leadership and different environment"" in the two countries.""Right now, we are having a very good relationship with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. But nobody is permanent in this world,"" Musharraf said emphasizing that the issue has to be resolved.
","Pakistan's President Musharraf and India's Prime Minister Singh met for talks in New Delhi in April 2005. 
Musharraf pronounced the peace process, begun in January 2004, as ""irreversible."" India and Pakistan agreed to 
open bank branches in each other's countries. Trade rose to $600 million in 2005, and they pledged improvement 
in air and shipping services. They also agreed to notify each other in advance of ballistic missile tests.
 Prime Minister Singh invited Kashmir's separatists for peace talks, a critical move toward pushing forward
  the peace process. They had previously been excluded from the talks between India and Pakistan. ","Despite improved economic and cultural relations, India and Pakistan have made little progress on the problem of Kashmir. However, leaders of both countries remain committed to the peace process. They planned formal talks on the subject in New Delhi on April 17, their first since India's Prime Minister Singh took office last May. On April 16, moderate Kashmiri separatist leaders were to meet with the Pakistani president in New Delhi. In June, they made a historic trip to Pakistan and met with Pakistani government officials. India's Prime Minister Singh invited them for peace talks to be held on September 5. ","In April 2005 Musharraf came to New Delhi for an India-Pakistan cricket match and his first talks with Singh. Kashmiri moderates in the All Party Hurriyat Conference (APHC) met with Musharraff there and later visited Pakistan. They demand inclusion in the peace process. Indian mediators had been in contact with APHC leaders since their 2004 talks. Some Kashmiri activists in Indian jails have been freed. Singh invited APHC moderates for peace talks September 5th. Singh and Musharraf met September 14th in NY, vowed to pursue peace in Kashmir but produced no major initiatives. India-Pakistan ties have strengthened in other areas. ","Progress continues to be made in the Indian-Pakistani dispute over Kashmir despite the April killing by suspected Muslim rebels of six Indians, including three policemen. The Pakistani President visited India in April for his first formal talks with the Indian Prime Minister. In June eight moderate separatist leaders from India visited Pakistan. In September the Indian Prime Minister invited separatists for peace talks. On the economic front, India and Pakistan were scheduled to hold joint economic meetings for the first time in 16 years. They are focusing on banking, air and shipping services, customs rules, and regular bus service.

D0902,D0902-A,"Nearly one-third of sexually active Portuguese girls between the ages of 15 and 19 have taken the ""morning-after"" pill to prevent pregnancy, according to a study published Thursday in the daily Publico.The study, one of the largest ever carried out into the contraceptive habits of Portuguese women, also found 16 percent of all sexually active girls in this age group do not use any form of birth control at all, the paper said.Yet fully 83.4 percent of 15-to-19-year-old women said they had received information on contraceptives at school, according to the study by the Portuguese Society of Gynecology.""We have to pay more attention to young women, this is where the greatest potential risks exist,"" the president of the association, Daniel Pereira da Silva, told the newspaper.Staunchly Roman Catholic Portugal has one of the highest teen pregnancy rates in the European Union.The study was carried out by the association among 3,858 women between the ages of 15 and 49, the paper said.
Peru's health minister said Monday that government plans todistribute morning-after birth control pills at public health clinicswill begin as scheduled in January, despite an attempt byconservative lawmakers in this predominantly Roman Catholic countryto have her prosecuted for promoting abortion.""The decision is made and there is no turning back,"" Health MinisterPilar Mazzetti told reporters. ""This is not based on personalbeliefs, but in technical and scientific studies that show the pillis not abortive.""Mazzetti said the pill, which contains the hormone levonorgestrel andis sold in Lima pharmacies under the brand-name Postinor-2, preventspregnancy by inhibiting ovulation.To be effective, it must be taken within 72 hours of intercourse.Last week three conservative legislators denounced Mazzetti for""lying"" when she reported to Peru's Justice Ministry that the pillsare not a form of abortion because they cancel a pregnancy before thefertilized egg implants itself in the uterus.The legislators, who argued that life begins upon fertilization, wantCongress to vote on whether to lift Mazzetti's constitutionalimmunity to face criminal charges.Abortion is illegal in Peru, except in cases where the mother's lifeis in danger.""Any time one assumes public office there is a risk,"" Mazzetti said.""Evidently, in a democratic country, everyone has the liberty to makedenunciations and accusations and whatever. If this accusation ispresented, the Ministry of Health will have to back up itsdecisions.""Peru's Medical Board has endorsed Mazzetti, and Rocio Villanueva,Peru's deputy human rights ombudsman, said the criminal allegationsagainst Mazzetti ""have no basis.""
Some see easy access to emergency contraception as a way todrastically reduce teen pregnancy, already on the decline in theUnited States since the early 1990s. Others worry that its long-termeffects on young women are unknown or argue that the drug, also knownas the ""morning after pill,"" encourages teens to have sex.Ultimately, it will be up to Food and Drug Administration officialsto decide: Should older teens be able to buy emergency contraceptionwithout a prescription?Earlier this year, the FDA denied one drug company's request to sellits brand of emergency contraception to anyone. Now that company,Barr Pharmaceuticals, has submitted a second proposal _ to sell itsPlan B brand to people 16 and older, but to require anyone youngerthan that to consult a physician. The company expects a decision nextyear.Sale without a prescription have received support from both theAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and AmericanMedical Association.Such access, some argue, would make it easier to get emergencycontraception on evenings and weekends, allowing more women to takeit in the recommended 72-hour window after unprotected sex.Others, including some young women, see it as a way for teens whodon't want their parents to know they're having sex to help preventunwanted pregnancy.""Kids are going to end up having kids because they're hiding fromtheir parents; they're too scared to tell them,"" said a 17-year-oldin New York City. She asked that her name not be used because herparents don't know she used the morning-after pill in April.The young woman is a patient of Dr. Bernadith Russell, the attendingphysician at Long Island Hospital's obstetrics and gynecologydepartment who also works in private practice at teen clinics inBrooklyn. She says the topic of unplanned pregnancy and emergencycontraception comes up with her patients nearly every day. But fewwant to discuss it with their parents _ or use insurance to buyemergency contraception out of fear their parents will find out.""I can't begin to say how much of a barrier that is,"" Russell says.However, a physician who opposes over-the-counter sale of emergencycontraception fears that young women would skip regular visits to thegynecologist if they didn't need to see a doctor to get it.""They're not going to get their pap smears; they're not going to getscreened for sexually transmitted disease,"" says Dr. Gene Rudd, agynecologist who serves as associate executive director of theTennessee-based Christian Medical Association.He also says some young women might not want to use emergencycontraception if they knew how it worked.A stronger dose of regular hormonal contraception, the morning-afterpill can prevent pregnancy by delaying a woman's ovulation or keepingsperm from fertilizing an egg.It also can thin the uterus lining, making it difficult for afertilized egg to implant. That's a major reason anti-abortion groups_ from the American Life League to the Pro-Life Action League _ areamong emergency contraception's main opponents.While many in the medical field do not share their view, they seeinterfering with a fertilized egg as abortion.""Emergency contraception is not true contraception,"" says SierraCorrea, the 22-year-old vice president of Collegians For Life, astudent group that opposes the morning-after pill. ""Drug companieshave been getting away with calling it contraception by redefiningpregnancy to mean implantation"" of a fertilized egg.Some opponents also have argued that easier access to themorning-after pill would make teens more likely to engage in riskysexual behavior _ though some doctors say that research done at theUniversity of Pittsburgh School of Medicine casts doubt on thatargument.The study, published in the April issue of the Journal of Pediatricand Adolescent Gynecology, found that teens who had emergencycontraception on hand were not more likely to have unprotected sex.It also concluded that those teens were more likely to use emergencycontraception correctly and sooner after sex, when it is mosteffective.Each year, there are about 3 million unintended pregnancies _ and inabout 800,000 of those cases the parents are teenagers, according tothe federal Centers for Disease Control.___On the Web:Princeton's emergency contraception site: http://www.NOT-2-LATE.comAmerican Life League's site: http://www.MorningAfterPill.org___Martha Irvine is a national writer specializing in coverage of peoplein their 20s and younger.

The U.S. government is considering whether to make morning-after birth controlavailable without a prescription, and like most issues that involve sex andpregnancy, it has generated heated debate.Fierce arguments have gone on inside and outside the Food and DrugAdministration, which may decide as soon as this week whether drug stores cansell the emergency contraception known as Plan B without a prescription to womenage 16 and older.Each side accuses the other of manipulating science for politicalpurpose.Plan B supporters say the pill is a safe way to prevent thousands of unwantedpregnancies and the abortions that sometimes follow. Making the contraceptionavailable over the counter, they say, is crucial for women who might need theprotection over a weekend or when it is difficult to obtain aprescription.Plan B can prevent pregnancy for up to 72 hours after sex. The sooner the pillis taken, the more effective it is.""Women's reproductive rights shouldn't hinge on someone else's schedule. Weshould have this at our fingertips. It should be next to condoms in drugstores,"" said Kelly Mangan, 22, president of the University of Florida's chapterof the National Organization for Women. She was arrested this month in a protestoutside the FDA's headquarters in suburban Maryland.Opponents worry that the drug encourages women _ teenagers in particular _ tohave risky sex. If over-the-counter sales are permitted, older teenagers oradults might buy the pills for some of their younger friends or their sexualpartners, critics say.""It encourages risky sexual activity with the promise `just pop a pill in themorning and you don't need to worry about pregnancy,'"" said Wendy Wright ofConcerned Women of America, a conservative group that focuses on socialissues.""What we're concerned about is a number of young people who are not engaged insexual activity who feel tremendous pressure, and this will only add to thepressure that is on them,"" Wright said.Not contested, by either side, is that the drug is drug is safe or effective.Some who work for the FDA believed that questions about people's sexual behaviorwere overwhelming scientific ones, according to an internal agency memo writtenlast year.""Some staff have expressed the concern that this decision is based onnon-medical implications of teen sexual behavior, or judgments about thepropriety of this activity,"" said the memo by the FDA's acting drug chief, Dr.Steven Galson.""These issues are beyond the scope of our drug approval process, and I have notconsidered them in this decision,"" wrote Galson, who last spring rejected thefirst application for Plan B's sale over the counter.A study this month is providing evidence for both sides.Researchers in San Francisco found that women who were given a supply of Plan Bto keep at home were no more likely to have unprotected intercourse than womenwho had to go to a clinic or pharmacy for the contraceptive. Women with easyaccess were more likely to use Plan B, leading researchers to conclude that easyaccess could prevent unwanted pregnancies.But the study, which only followed women for six months, found that the twogroups had about the same pregnancy rate, undercutting the argument that Plan Bprevents unwanted pregnancies and abortion.Last May, the FDA rejected nonprescription sales of emergency contraception,against the overwhelming recommendation of the agency's own scientificadvisers.The FDA said it worried that there was not enough data about the pill's use byyoung teenagers. The agency promised to reconsider if the pill's manufacturer,Barr Laboratories of Pomona, New York, figured out how to sell over the counteronly to those 16 and older.In July, Barr again applied for approval. The company now proposes that drugstores check customers' ages to be certain that buyers are at least 16, anapproach the FDA has not approved before. Younger teenagers could continue toget the drug with a doctor's prescription.The morning-after pill is a higher dose of the contraceptive hormones found inthe Pill. It prevents ovulation or fertilization, and can prevent a fertilizedegg from implanting into the uterus.Because medical experts do not consider a woman to be pregnant until after anegg implants into the uterus, the morning-after pill is not considered abortion,although some conservatives object to any interference with a fertilizedegg.If a woman already is pregnant, morning-after pills have no effect. But takenwithin 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, they can cut a woman's chances ofpregnancy by up to 89 percent.___On the Net:
This editorial appeared in Saturday's Los Angeles Times:A strong conviction that teenagers should not have sex can leave noroom for reality -- like the fact that many teenagers do have sex, nomatter what society or their elders say. The Bush administration'ssimplistic policies for complicated and difficult family planningproblems like teen pregnancies looked naive four years ago; theircontinued application in light of ongoing research looks ridiculous.Most parents certainly agree with President Bush that teen sex is abad idea. But even though adults may hector endlessly, an estimated800,000 teen-age girls still become pregnant every year.The administration's response has been to sink millions of dollarsinto abstinence-only education, depleting funds from programs thatprovide contraception. No surprise then that the administration arguesthat allowing adolescents easy access to the morning-after pill wouldonly confuse its abstinence message. So earlier this year, when a Foodand Drug Administration panel recommended that emergency contraceptionbe available without a prescription, a top agency official overruledthe scientists. In most states the drug has stayed off-limits toeveryone -- teens and adults -- who can't get to a doctor within 72hours after unprotected sex or can't afford one.A recent study by the University of Pittsburgh Medical School foundthat teens who had emergency contraception on hand were not morelikely to have unprotected sex. They were, however, more likely to usethe drug correctly to prevent pregnancy. This study confirms otherfindings and is one reason why most obstetricians and gynecologistsback easy access.The drug's makers are again asking for FDA approval; this time theypropose to sell Plan B (the drug's trade name) only to people 16 andolder without restrictions. Younger teens would have to consult aphysician. The FDA could decide on the request in the coming months.This time maybe science -- and reality -- will trump moral certainty.
Providing women with easy access to the emergencycontraceptive Plan B did not lead them to engage in more risky sexualbehavior, a study of more than 2,000 young California women hasconcluded.The study did find that women given a supply to keep at home werealmost twice as likely to use the drug after unprotected sex as thosewho had to pick it up at a clinic or pharmacy. The findings led thestudy authors to conclude that easy access to Plan B, also called themorning-after pill, could cut the number of unwanted pregnancies whileposing no apparent risk to women.The study contradicts a key claim made by opponents of easieraccess to Plan B at a time when the Food and Drug Administration ispreparing to decide on a second application to allow nonprescriptionsales of the drug.In an indication of the strong feelings on both sides, advocates ofPlan B plan to sit in Friday at FDA headquarters in suburban Bethesda,Md. Some protesters have called for civil disobedience if the FDAofficial who rejected the first Plan B application, Steven Galson ofthe Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, refuses to meet withthem.The FDA turned down the initial application last May, saying therewasn't enough information on how easy access would affect the sexualbehavior of young teens.``Our findings were that women don't change their sexual behaviorwhen the drug is easily available, but rather that they're more likelyto use it if access is easier,'' said lead author Tina Raine of theCenter for Reproductive Health Research and Policy of the Universityof California, San Francisco.The study looked at 2,117 San Francisco-area women ages 15 to 24who were randomly put into one of three groups. One third were giventhe drug to take home, one third were told it could be picked upwithout a prescription at a clinic, and the final third could get itwithout a prescription at a pharmacy.The study found that roughly the same percentage of each group hadunprotected sex over a six-month period, that incidence of sexuallytransmitted disease was equal, and that about the same percentagebecame pregnant.Nonetheless, about 37 percent of women in the group given Plan B totake home used it at least once during the six months, compared with21 percent in the clinic-access group and 24 percent in thepharmacy-access group.The FDA's initial decision to reject nonprescription sales touchedoff sharp criticism -- from FDA's staff and members of its expertadvisory panel, among others -- that the agency was bowing to politicalpressure from social conservatives. In a letter to President Bush, 49members of Congress asked that the application be rejected.The medical profession does not consider emergency contraception tobe an abortion pill like RU-486, or Mifeprex, because Plan B works bypreventing a pregnancy from starting rather than ending an existingone. But some critics of Plan B consider it an abortifacient.The new study, being published Wednesday in the Journal of theAmerican Medical Association, supports the position taken by much ofthe FDA review staff and 23 of 27 members of the FDA advisory panelthat the drug could be safely and properly used without aprescription.After the FDA rejected its initial application, the maker of PlanB, Barr Pharmaceuticals, resubmitted a modified application to addressthe concerns about teen-age users. The company's new application wouldmake the drug available over the counter for women older than 16, andby prescription-only for those who are younger.Barr spokeswoman Carol Cox said the company still believes the drugcan be safely sold on open shelves but would accept a compromise toplace Plan B behind the counter. That would require a pharmacyemployee to retrieve the drug, making enforcement of an agerestriction easier.Plan B consists of the synthetic progestin levonorgestrel and ismost effective when used within 24 hours of an unprotected sexualencounter. While the FDA has approved it only for prescription use,six states have passed laws that allow pharmacists to dispense thedrug without a prescription after a discussion with the woman.The University of California study was initiated in part to seewhether getting the drug from a pharmacy would be more acceptable towomen than getting it from a clinic, and Raine said the results appearto show it was not. The study was funded by grants from a number ofprivate foundations that invested in the Women's Capital Corporation,which initially developed the drug. Raine said neither the foundationsnor Barr Pharmaceuticals, which supplied the drugs for the women, hadany influence over the study.
Nine women protesting the Food and DrugAdministration's position on the emergency contraceptive Plan B werearrested Friday when they blocked entry to the agency's Rockville,Md., headquarters.The women, part of a noisy protest in favor of making themorning-after pill available without a prescription, were taken awayby officers of the Department of Homeland Security and charged withdisorderly conduct.The protesters said they wanted to speak with Steven Galson, actingdirector of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, who inMay rejected an application to allow Plan B to be sold over thecounter. FDA staff reviewers and an advisory panel of outside expertshad strongly recommended approval, saying the emergency contraceptivecould be safely sold without a prescription.Friday's protest came as the agency is preparing to rule later thismonth on a second application by Barr Pharmaceuticals Inc. to makePlan B more easily accessible. That proposal would allow the drug tobe sold to women over 16 without a prescription but would require adoctor's order for girls below that age.One of the protest organizers, Alex Leader from New York, said thedemonstrators opposed any age restrictions and are concerned that theagency will not approve the new application at all.``We don't trust the FDA at this point,'' Leader said. ``The Bushadministration is playing to its social conservatives by not approvingPlan B, even though the experts say it's safe. Women need this drugavailable now.''FDA officials said Galson was not available to meet the women butacting Deputy Commissioner Janet Woodcock would be willing to see fiveof the demonstrators. They rejected the offer.About 40 protesters, mostly from Florida and New York, took part inthe demonstration. Three representatives of Concerned Women forAmerica, which opposes easier access to Plan B, were also present.Wendy Wright, CWA's policy director, said she hopes ``the FDA won'tbase its decision on stunts like this.'' She said allowingnonprescription sales ``would be simply disastrous.''``You could have a 40-year-old man who is committing statutory rapeon a 14-year-old simply going in and picking up Plan B himself. An agelimit won't stop anyone.''The Bush administration has been cool to the expanded use ofemergency contraception, which some conservatives see as a form ofabortion. This week, the Justice Department issued guidelines fortreating rape victims that make no mention of emergency contraception,leading to criticism from women's health groups and others that astandard precaution for rape victims was being ignored. A departmentspokesman said the new guidelines do not '' supersede the many state,local and tribal protocols that are currently in practice.''Kelly Mangan, a National Organization for Women activist fromFlorida who was among those arrested, said the group has pledges from2,000 other women to break the law by sharing theirprescription-purchased Plan B with women who need it but have noprescription.Studies have shown that emergency contraception works for about 72hours after unprotected sex but is best used within 24 hours. The needfor speed is a key argument made by advocates of easier access.Also on Friday, the American College of Obstetricians andGynecologists called on the FDA to approve the new application.``ACOG and other organizations have estimated that greater accessto emergency contraceptives could cut the U.S. unintended pregnancyand abortion rates in half,'' the group said in a statement.
This editorial appeared in Friday's Los Angeles Times:Only 40 years ago, within the memory of millions of Americans,birth control could not be legally sold in some states, even tomarried couples. If President Bush and his allies in Congress aresuccessful, the future could look much like that past.For some Bush supporters, religious beliefs about when life beginsor about interfering with ``natural law'' justify limiting access tocommon forms of birth control. The motivation for others may bedisapproval of sex outside of marriage -- by adults as well as teens.Whatever the impetus, the emerging results are astonishing.As part of abstinence-only sex education, which the presidentchampions and taxpayers now fund to the tune of $170 million annually,U.S. teens are being taught a bunch of hooey. A recent congressionalreport found the program's materials warn that touching another'sgenitals ``can result in pregnancy'' and that condoms fail to preventHIV transmission one-third of the time. Actually, studies find thatcondoms are nearly always effective in blocking HIV and other sexuallytransmitted diseases if used properly (and we hope we don't need torefute the first assertion).Giving teens false and misleading information is bad enough. Morepernicious is the administration's reluctance to back internationalAIDS prevention programs that distribute condoms, a reluctance thatcould cost millions of Asians and Africans their lives. The policy isutterly inexplicable, unless it is to placate those who think condomscould encourage adults to have sex.The same logic is behind ``refusal'' laws. Twelve states now allowpharmacists who oppose contraception to refuse to fill prescriptionsfor birth control, including the ``morning-after pill.'' Sen. RickSantorum, R-Pa., plans to reintroduce his bill from last year toextend that right nationwide.The religious right's fingerprints also can be seen on the JusticeDepartment's first-ever guidebook, released last fall, on treatingsexual assault victims. It is an otherwise laudable effort to help winmore rape cases, outlining in 140 graphic pages the best practices forevidence collection, forensic analysis and victim support. Forinstance, six pages detail testing protocols for sexually transmitteddisease, treatment and psychological counseling. But the section on``Pregnancy Risk Evaluation and Care'' is a scant half-page ofeuphemisms and generalities. Omitted from the final version was draftlanguage about the effectiveness of emergency contraception inpreventing pregnancy.The morning-after pill acts by impeding ovulation, fertilizationand implantation. To most doctors, it is not a method of abortion. Butthose who believe that life begins at conception think it is, andJustice officials apparently are seeking to appease them.So, it seems, is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which isstalling a decision on whether to make the morning-after pillavailable nationwide without a prescription. Opponents claim that easyaccess would encourage promiscuity, despite data to the contrary fromstates such as California, where the pill is more freely available.Surely this backward future is not what most Bush supportersthought they voted for last fall.
The first of possibly several bills seeking to let Texas pharmacists""just say no"" to filling prescriptions for emergency contraceptiveshas been filed before the legislative session that begins in January.Groups opposing the bill, as well as the bill's author, said itslanguage will probably change during the legislative process toaccommodate certain concerns.In its current form, the bill would allow pharmacists to refuse todispense some birth-control pills. The definition in the bill ofemergency contraceptives, commonly called the morning-after pill,also fits some nonemergency contraceptives, or birth-control pills.That would not sit well with members of the Texas Abortion andReproductive Rights Action League, an organization spokeswoman said.""This bill would cause women to have to rol the dice every time theywent to have a prescription filled,"" spokeswoman Sarah Wheat said.The new legislation was filed to allow pharmacists the sameprotections other Texas health care professionals enjoy, said itsauthor, state Rep. Frank Corte Jr., R-San Antonio.Pharmacists are worried that they may face repercussions if theychoose to follow their conscience and refuse to serve a customer onmoral or ethical grounds, Corte said. But ifthe bill is passed, itshould not stand between a woman and her health care needs, he said.""Our intent is to affect the prescriptions that terminate pregnancies-- that's what most of the pharmacists are concerned about,"" he said.""We have pharmacists who have received ultimatums from theiremployers.""In January, pharmacists at an Eckerd Drug Store in Denton denied amorning-after pill to a rape victim. Three pharmacists were fired asa result of that incident. In March, a CVS pharmacist in NorthRichland Hills refused to fill Julee Lacey's prescription for birthcontrol pills.The pharmacist told Lacey that she did not believe in any form ofbirth control and advised her to go to a nearby Walgreens forassistance, said Lacey, of Fort Worth. Lacey remembers feelingfrustrated.""I entrust my care to my physician, not my pharmacist,"" Lacey said.""We have to consider what could happen if this should go any further.There are some people who don't believe in trasplants. I just want toknow where they are going to draw the line.""The morning-after pill is a higher dose of regular hormonalcontraception that works to prevent pregnancy if taken within 72hours after intercourse.When the bill's language is refined, it should only refer to themorning-after pill, said state Rep. Charles Hopson, D-Jacksonville.Hopson, who is also a pharmacist, said the bill needs to clearlystate that patients will be presented with an alternative if apharmacist refuses to serve them.""Some of th big chain stores are comfortable with the concept, butthey would like to know which pharmacists will fill all prescriptionsand which ones will not,"" Hopson said. ""They also want to make surethat there is some alternative for the patient.""This bill, and similar legislation passed or recently proposed inabout a dozen other states, discriminates against women, said RachelLaser, senior counsel with the National Women's Law Center inWashington, D.C.""If yougo into a profession to assist the medical needs of people,you are not in a position to single out women just because youbelieve a prescription is something other than what the FDA says itis,"" Laser said. ""Women find the experience of being denied aprescription humiliating and demoralizing.""Texas Pharmacy Association policy calls for pharmacists to discussconcerns about dispensing prescriptions with their employers beforerefusing service to a patient, said Jim Martin, the association'sexecutive director.Pharmacits should make arrangements to ensure that customers can gettheir prescription filled, even though one pharmacist may object tofilling a prescription for a specific drug, Martin said. Theassociation has not formulated a position on this legislation, Martinsaid.But, ""Our position is that a pharmacist has a right to fill or notfill a prescription,"" Martin said.The Texas Alliance for Life supports the legislation, said JoePojman, executiv director.""My basic concern remains that the pharmacist ought to be able toconscientiously object to participate in something that is thepotential taking of human life,"" he said. ""I'm very concerned thatwomen get the proper health care, but I'm also concerned with thehealth care providers.""(ONLINE: To read the bill, go to www.capitol.state.tx.us; TexasPharmacy Association, www.texaspharmacy.org.

Over the years, I have met very fewwomen who didn't regret their abortions. But I haven't talkedto a single woman who regretted having the child shehad considered aborting.That's why U.S. Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's recent candor on abortion-- that it should be rare, but legal -- waswelcome. What we need now is this sort of honestdiscussion of the issue that reflects current realities and values.American opinion has shifted since 1973, when the U.S. Supreme Courtdecided the landmark Roe vs. Wade case. Medical advancements thatpermit women to hear their baby's heartbeat at four weeks,see their fingers and toes at 10 weeks and allowbabies to survive outside the womb at 24 weeks haveinfluenced our perception of when life begins.Like most Catholics, I oppose abortion. But like most Americans, Idon't want the government deciding the issue for a woman.Abortion should remain legal. Never again should women be forcedto back alleys or foreign countries to terminate their pregnancies-- particularly if they've been raped or if pregnancy posesa life-threatening risk to a mother.We do have the power to make abortions rare, and itcan be done without passing a law. But we needbetter choices than those of the moralizing right, whose restrictivepolicies on sex education, emergency contraception (the morning after pill)and medical care for the working poor force many womento choose between an abortion and rearing a child inpoverty. Their efforts to keep young people ignorant about sex-- with abstinence-only sex education -- deprives many of themof the knowledge they need to prevent unwanted pregnancies. Inthe United States, 19 percent of women who get abortionsare teenagers.The liberals are no better. Their abortion-on-demand policies ignore medical advancementsand evolving societal values. It has become difficult to thinkof a living, growing organism with a heartbeat and brainas merely a fetus -- whether it is a fewweeks or several months old. It's not a stretch tovisualize a time in the near future when babies willbe able to survive outside the womb much earlier thanthey do today. At some point, the left needs toaccept that most Americans have grown uncomfortable with the practiceof terminating pregnancies to avoid responsibility of rearing children andwith partial-birth abortions that are done after the first trimester.Texas' law that requires parents to be notified (or a reviewby a judge) if their minor children seek an abortionis a reasonable restriction that respects the sensibilities of mostTexans. But the State Board of Education's backward move toprevent sex education regarding condoms and other contraceptives from reachingTexas classrooms runs counter to most parents' sentiments.It doesn't help that so many Texas children are languishing instate foster homes. These are minority kids, mostly African-American. Motherswho can't raise their children face the heartbreaking prospect ofgiving their babies over to a callous system that passesthem from one stranger's arms to another.We could make real progress in reducing abortions if groups onboth sides used their resources to help women overcome theconditions that make abortions so appealing.More than 1 million abortions are preformed each year in thiscountry. That's a tragedy. Outlawing abortion isn't the answer. Legalor not, abortions will continue until women no longer haveto seriously contemplate whether their babies would be better offif they were never born. What a choice.Alberta Phillips writes for The Austin American-Statesman. E-mail:aphillips@statesman.com
","The FDA has approved the use of an emergency contraceptive, called the morning-after pill. When used within 72 hours after intercourse, the drug prevents pregnancy. Barr Pharmaceuticals proposed that the FDA allow girls age 16 or older to obtain the drug over the counter. Proponents claimed it would be invaluable in preventing unplanned pregnancies. Opponents argued that the pill causes abortion, which they strongly oppose. Medical authorities disputed this. Conservatives feared its use would make young girls more promiscuous. Research following 2,000 California girls found that those who used the pill were not more likely to have unprotected sex. ","Introduction of the ""morning-after pill"" led to much controversy over its use and distribution. Some groups considered it a form of abortion while others argued it was not. Some said it encouraged teen-age sex while scientific studies indicated it did not. The pill was available by prescription only. Proponents argued for its sale ""over the counter"" (OTC). Opponents said this would encourage teen-age sex. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rejected a proposal for OTC sales in May 2004. In January 2005 it continued to consider OTC sales to women 16 years or older. ","Debate continues on over-the-counter availability of the ""morning after pill."" US supporters consider it safe and effective in preventing unwanted pregnancies. Those opposed, especially the Bush administration and the religious right, consider the pill an abortion, interference with ""natural law"", and promoting promiscuity. Two studies found it did not increase sexual activity, but also did not decrease pregnancies. The DEA is expected to decide soon whether the pill can be dispensed over the counter to those 16 and older. Also debated is whether pharmacists may refuse to fill prescriptions for this pill. Other nations are also concerned. ","The conflict over approval of the morning-after pill continues. Both sides consider the drug safe and effective. Opponents claim that such accessability would encourage teens to have sex. Supporters say that it would reduce the number of teenage pregnancies significantly. The Bush Administration has promoted abstinence-only education and a top FDA official rejected nonprescription sales, overruling the strong recommendation of FDA scientific advisers. Six states allow nonprescription sales of the drug. Now there is a proposal that to make the pill available without prescription to those 16 and older, but to require younger teens to consult a physician. "
D0902,D0902-B,"Only one-third of British teens use condoms consistently, a  health charity said in a report Thursday warning that ignorance about sexual health was putting youth at risk.Out of 1,300 people aged 16 to 18 surveyed for the Brook study, a majority said they had used a preservative at least once, but only 37 percent of males said they used them consistently and only 30 percent made their partners use them.""Condom confusion"" increased their risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) since the devices were used primarily to prevent pregnancy rather than for health protection, and were often ""applied too late, or removed too early,"" Brook said.General ignorance about sexual health risks was widespread: 52 percent of respondents thought chlamydia affected only women, and 31 percent thought sexually transmitted infections could be caught from a toilet seat.Fifty-four percent also did not know that the ""morning after"" contraceptive pill could remain effective for up to 72 hours after sexual intercourse.There was also a significant gap between teens' general concern about STIs and HIV/AIDS, and whether they considered themselves personally at risk of disease.While 89 percent of men and 82 percent of women polled expressed general worry, only 61 percent and 50 percent, respectively, thought they might be at risk.Jan Barlow, chief executive of Brook, said the report should serve to ""focus"" attention on young people's sexual health.""Many (youths) think that STIs are something that happen to other people -- they simply don't believe that the risk applies to them personally,"" she said in a statement.""Britain's sexual health crisis won't go away until this problem is tackled head-on in sexual health awareness campaigns and in improved sex and relationships education in schools.""Brook also found that schools were the most frequently cited source of information about STIs -- much more so than parents, friends or literature.According to the non-profit youth advisory organization, Britain has seen a huge rise in acute STIs since 1995.Chlamydia cases increased by 190 percent between 1995 and 2003, gonorrhea by 137 percent. Syphillis, even though it only affects a small number of people, went up by 1,062 percent. The rise in STIs was much higher across the board for young people.
Some pharmacists around the country are refusing to fillprescriptions for birth control and morning-after pills, saying thatdispensing the medications violates their personal moral or religiousbeliefs.The trend has opened a new front in the nation's battle overreproductive rights, sparking an intense debate over the competingrights of pharmacists to refuse to participate in something theyconsider repugnant versus a woman's right to get medications herdoctor has prescribed. It has triggered pitched political battles inState Houses across the nation as politicians seek to pass laws eitherto protect pharmacists from being penalized -- or force them to carryout their duties.``This is a very big issue that's just beginning to surface,'' saidSteven H. Aden of the Christian Legal Society's Center for Law andReligious Freedom in Annandale, Va., which defends pharmacists. ``Moreand more pharmacists are becoming aware of their right toconscientiously refuse to pass objectionable medications across thecounter. We are on the very front edge of a wave that's going to breaknot too far down the line.''An increasing number of clashes are occurring. Pharmacists oftenrisk dismissal or other disciplinary action to stand up for theirbeliefs, while shaken teen-age girls and women desperately call theirdoctors, frequently late at night, after being turned away bysometimes lecturing men and women in white coats.``There are pharmacists who will only give birth control pills to awoman if she's married. There are pharmacists who mistakenly believecontraception is a form of abortion and refuse to prescribe it toanyone,'' said Adam Sonfield of the Alan Guttmacher Institute in NewYork, which tracks reproductive issues. ``There are even cases ofpharmacists holding prescriptions hostage, where they won't eventransfer it to another pharmacy when time is of the essence.''That's what happened to Kathleen Pulz and her husband, who panickedwhen the condom they were using broke. Their fear spiked when theWalgreens pharmacy near their home in Milwaukee refused to fill anemergency prescription for the morning-after pill.``I couldn't believe it,'' said Pulz, 43 , who with her husband hadlong ago decided they could not afford a fifth child. ``How can theymake that decision for us? I was outraged. At the same time, I was sadthat we had to do this. But I was scared. I didn't know what we weregoing to do.''Supporters of pharmacists' rights see the trend as a welcomeexpression of personal belief. Women's groups see it as a major threatto reproductive rights and one of the latest manifestations of thereligious right's growing political reach -- this time into theneighborhood pharmacy.``This is another indication of the current political atmosphereand climate,'' said Rachel Laser of the National Women's Law Center inWashington. ``It's outrageous. It's sex discrimination. It preventsaccess to a basic form of health care for women. We're going back intime.''The issue could intensify further if the Food and DrugAdministration approves the sale of the Plan B morning-after pillwithout a prescription -- a step that would likely make pharmacists theprimary gatekeeper.The question of health care workers refusing to provide certainservices first emerged among doctors, nurses and other health careworkers over abortions. The trend began to spread to pharmacists withthe approval of the morning-after pill and physician-assisted suicidein Oregon, with support from such organizations as the U.S. Conferenceof Catholic Bishops and the Pharmacists for Life International, whichclaims 1,600 members on six continents, primarily the United States,Canada and Britain.``Our group was founded with the idea of returning pharmacy to ahealing-only profession. What's been going on is the use of medicationto stop human life. That violates the ideal of the Hippocratic Oaththat medical practitioners should do no harm,'' said Karen L. Brauer,the group's president, who was fired from a K-Mart pharmacy in Delhi,Ohio, for refusing to fill birth control prescriptions.No one knows exactly how often that is happenning, but cases havebeen reported across the country, including in California, Washington,Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Texas, New Hampshire,Ohio and North Carolina. Advocates on both sides say the refusalsappear to be spreading, often surfacing only in the rare instanceswhen women file complaints.Pharmacists are regulated by state laws and can face disciplinaryaction from licensing boards. But the only case that has gotten thatfar involves Neil T. Noesen, who in 2002 refused to fill a Universityof Wisconsin student's birth control pill prescription at a K-Mart inMenomonie, Wis., or transfer the prescription elsewhere. Anadministrative judge last month recommended Noesen be required to takeethics classes, alert future employers to his beliefs and pay whatcould be as much as $20,000 to cover the costs of the legalproceedings. The state pharmacy board will decide whether to imposethat penalty next month.(begin optional trim)``He's a devout Roman Catholic and believes participating in anyaction that inhibits or prohibits human life is a sin,'' said Aden ofthe Christian Legal Society. ``The rights of pharmacists like himshould be respected.''(end optional trim)Wisconsin is one of at least 11 states considering ``conscienceclause'' laws that would protect pharmacists like Noesen. Four stateshave laws that specifically allow pharmacists to refuse to fillprescriptions that violate their beliefs. At the same time, at leastfour states are considering laws that would explicitly requirepharmacists to fill all prescriptions.The American Pharmacists Association recently reaffirmed its policythat pharmacists can refuse to fill prescriptions as long as they makesure customers can get their medications some other way.(begin optional trim)``We don't have a profession of robots. We have a profession ofhumans. We have to acknowledge that individual pharmacists haveindividual beliefs,'' said Susan Winckler, the association's vicepresident for policy and communications. ``What we suggest is thatthey identify those situations ahead of time and have an alternativesystem set up so the patient has access to their therapy.''(end optional trim)The alternative system can include making sure another pharmacistis on duty who can take over or making sure another pharmacy nearby iswilling to fill the prescription, Winckler said. ``The key is that itshould be seamless and avoids a conflict between the pharmacist'sright to step away and the patient's right to obtain theirmedication,'' she said.Brauer, of Pharmacists for Life, defends the right of pharmacistsnot only to decline to fill prescriptions themselves but also torefuse to refer customers elsewhere or transfer prescriptions.``That's like saying, 'I don't kill people myself but let me tellyou about the guy down the street who does.' What's that saying? 'Iwill not off your husband but I know a buddy who will?' It's the samething,'' said Brauer, who now works at hospital pharmacy.Large pharmacy chains, including Walgreens, Wal-Mart and CVS, haveinstituted similar policies that try to balance pharmacists' andcustomers' rights. ``We obviously do have pharmacists with individualmoral and ethical beliefs. When it does happen, the pharmacist isasked to notify the manager that they have decided not to fill theprescription, and the manager has the obligation to make sure thecustomer has access to the prescription by another means,'' saidTiffany Bruce, a spokesperson for Walgreens. ``We have to respect thepharmacist but we have to also respect the right of the person toreceive the prescription.''Women's advocates say such policies are impractical, especiallylate at night in emergency situations involving the morning-afterpill, which must be taken within 72 hours. Even in non-urgent cases,poor women have a hard time getting enough time off work or money togo from one pharmacy to another. Young women, who are often alreadyfrightened and unsure of themselves, may simply give up whenconfronted by a judgmental pharmacist.``What is a women supposed to do in rural America, in places wherethere may only be one pharmacy?'' asked Nancy Keenan, president ofNARAL Pro-Choice America, which is launching a campaign Monday tocounter the trend. ``It's a slap in the face to women.''(optional add end)By the time Suzanne Richards, 21, finally got another pharmacy tofill her morning-after pill prescription -- after being rejected by adrive-through Brooks pharmacy in Laconia, N.H., one late Saturdaynight in September -- the 72 hours had long passed.``When he told me he wouldn't fill it, I just pulled over in theparking lot and started crying,'' said Richards, a single mother of a3-year-old who runs her own cleaning service. ``I just couldn'tbelieve it. I was just trying to be responsible.''In the end, Richards turned out not to be pregnant.Pulz obtained her prescription last June directly from her doctor,though she does not think she was pregnant either.``I was lucky,'' Pulz said. ``I can sympathize with someone whofeels strongly and doesn't want to be involved. But they should juststep out of the way and not interfere with someone else's decision.It's just not right.'' 
Senate Democrats on Thursday questioned Dr. Lester M. Crawford,President Bush's choice to lead the Food and Drug Administration,about why the agency had so far refused to allowover-the-counter sales of Plan B, the morning-after pill.""What has disturbed many of us is what appears is politicalinterference in a scientific process,"" said Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton,D-N.Y. ""We rely on the FDA for everything we take,and I am hopeful that we will reverse what appearsto be a dangerous slide into political opinion as opposedto scientific evidence.""Sens. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Patty Murray of Washington Stateand Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland expressed similar concerns.Crawford said that the FDA's consideration of the morning-after pill's applicationwas delayed because of its complexity, not because of politicalinterference.""I can assure you that this decision will not be basedon politics,"" Crawford said. ""It will be based on science.""Crawford appeared before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committeeas part of his confirmation process to become the FDAcommissioner. Bush nominated him in February after Crawford had servednearly a year as the agency's acting commissioner. The committeeis expected to vote on his nomination on April 13.His confirmation is widely expected.Several of the committee's Democrats said that they wanted answers fromCrawford about the agency's actions on the morning-after pill beforethey voted on his nomination. Crawford promised to give thema more detailed explanation.The FDA's staff and an advisory committee had earlier recommended thatthe morning-after pill known as Plan B be approved forsale on pharmacy shelves. But in an unusual move, Dr.Steven Galson, acting director of the agency's center for drugevaluation and research, rejected the application.Galson said that the application failed to deal with concerns thatthe easy availability of the contraceptives might lead teenagers toengage in riskier sex. The FDA has rarely asked anapplicant to study whether the availability of a cure mightlead some people to engage in risky behavior. Galson saidpolitics did not play a role in his decision.Plan B's maker, Barr Laboratories, has since applied to sell thepill ""behind the counter."" People seeking the medicine would needto prove that they are 16 or older. Those under16 would need a prescription. No pill is presently soldthis way, although nicotine patches are not supposed to besold to those under the age of 18.The FDA was supposed to issue a decision on the laterapplication by January but did not do so. Crawford saidthat missing such deadlines was unusual. He was asked whenthe new decision would be issued.""Is it days or weeks?"" Kennedy asked.""I wouldn't want to say days, I would say weeks,"" Crawfordanswered. He later said that he could not guarantee adecision before the committee voted on his nomination.Crawford said that the agency ""had no real dispute"" with thedrug's label at this point. He also repeatedly stated thatthe drug's approval had simply been delayed.Some on the panel expressed concerns about the many drug-safety scandalsover the last year. News that antidepressants and some popularpain pills have lethal side effects has led to criticismthat the agency is not sufficiently vigilant in its regulationof drugs. Some in Congress have proposed a separate drug-safetyagency that would monitor side effects of approved medicines.Crawford said that he was increasing the budget and the staffof the agency's drug-safety office, and he promised to makethe group independent of the agency's new-drug reviewers. New-drug reviewers""may have an affinity with the drug that probably doesn'tlook good, at a bare minimum. So we're going tobe making a separation,"" he said.The agency has been criticized recently for convening advisory committees filledwith experts who have financial ties to drug makers. Crawfordsaid that the vetting and disclosure of such ties willchange.Crawford was also asked whether he approved of drug imports. ""Asfar as being safe, that worries me a lot,"" heanswered.Crawford also said that he was working with the National Institutesof Health to establish a registry of all human clinicaltrials. Medical experts have called for a registry in thewake of disclosures that drug companies often keep trials secretif the results reflect poorly on their drugs.""We have heard the unalloyed message from the public that theywant to know about those clinical trials, they want tobe able to read about them,"" Crawford said. ""So that'sa charge to keep and we will move forward asbest we can.""
President Bush's nominee to lead the Food and DrugAdministration is being blocked from Senate confirmation by two Democratswho said Wednesday that they would hold up a voteuntil the agency settled the long-delayed question of whether anemergency contraceptive could be sold over the counter.The Democrats, Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and PattyMurray of Washington, met with the nominee, Lester M. Crawford,onWednesday to discuss what they regard as foot-dragging on theissue of the so-called morning-after pill. An expert panel ofscientists recommended over-the-counter sales in December 2003, but the agencyhas yet to issue a final ruling.""I'm prepared to hold it for as long as it takesto get a decision made,"" Clinton said. She added, ""Fromeverything we're able to determine, the agency has substituted politicsand ideology for science and facts.""Crawford could not be reached, and an agency spokeswoman, Kathleen Quinn,said the FDA would have no comment. But at ahearing last month, Crawford told senators the decision on thecontraceptive ""will not be based on politics.""He did not say then when a final decision would bemade, nor did he do so on Wednesday, Murray said.""It was very frustrating and very unsatisfactory,"" she said, adding,""I did not get any timeline at all for adecision and there was no new information.""The hold complicates the future of the food and drug agencyat a time when it is already being criticized forits handling of several drug safety scandals. Studies revealing thepotentially lethal side effects of some antidepressants and popular painmedicines, like the Merck drug Vioxx, have prompted critics tocharge that the agency is not vigilant enough in protectingconsumers.The White House had hoped Crawford, who is the acting commissionerof the agency, would help tamp some of that criticism.""Dr. Les Crawford is a well-qualified candidate,"" a White House spokeswoman,Erin Healy, said Wednesday, adding that the Bush administration ""willcontinue to work with the Senate to ensure his confirmation.""Crawford has doctorates in veterinary medicine and pharmacology.But ever since his nomination in February, Crawford has been confrontedwith questions not only about the safety scandals, but alsoabout the emergency contraceptive, also known as Plan B. Thesenior Democrat on the Senate Health Education Labor Committee, Sen.Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, has also raised questions aboutthe morning-after pill.Kennedy, who attended Wednesday's meeting, has decided against putting a holdon Crawford's nomination, a spokeswoman said. But the spokeswoman, LauraCapps, said Kennedy ""conveyed today that he is hopeful thatthe FDA will do the right thing and make adecision on this product, and until it is settled hebelieves it's doubtful that Dr. Crawford can be confirmed.""Though Clinton and Murray believe the drug should be made availableover the counter, both said that their interest was solelyin getting a decision from the FDA and that theywould remove the hold regardless of the outcome.Plan B, manufactured by Barr Laboratories, was approved for use byprescription in June 1999. Consisting of two pills, it isintended to be taken in the 72 hours after unprotectedsex, either when regular contraception fails or is skipped. Butadvocates for women's health said selling it by prescription hamperedits usefulness, because it was difficult for women to seetheir doctors quickly enough to get a prescription.Opponents of the pill, including religious conservatives, have said it willencourage sexual promiscuity.But in December 2003, two committees of expert advisers to thefood and drug agency, meeting jointly, voted, 23-4, to recommendover-the-counter sales. The agency typically follows the advice of itsexpert advisers, but the decision has been delayed on severaloccasions.More recently, Barr Laboratories has applied to sell the pill ""behindthe counter""; women seeking to buy it would have toprove they are 16 or older while those under 16would need a prescription. The agency was supposed to issuea decision on that in January, but missed a deadline.At last month's hearing, before the Senate Committee on Health EducationLabor and Pensions, Crawford said missing such deadlines was unusual.Asked when the new decision would be issued, he said:""I wouldn't want to say days. I would say weeks.""But he said he could not guarantee a decision beforeApril 13, when the committee is expected to vote onhis nomination.
The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, April8:When a president picks his administration officials, the opposing political partycan't expect to be thrilled with the selections. Right now,Democrats in the Senate are trying to block the nominationsof three men chosen by George W. Bush for importantposts: John Bolton for U.N. ambassador, Stephen Johnson for headof the Environmental Protection Agency, and Dr. Lester Crawford forcommissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. They have excellentreasons for opposition in each case, but some reasons aremore excellent than others.Bolton stands out because he is not only bad in apolicy sense, but also unqualified for the post to whichhe's been named. At a minimum, the U.S. representative tothe United Nations should be a person who believes itis a good idea. Bolton has never made secret hisdisdain for the United Nations, for multilateralism, and for consensus-seekingdiplomacy in general.When the Senate Foreign Relations Committee begins taking testimony on Bolton'snomination next week, it is also expected to hear othercharges about his fitness, like allegations that when he wasundersecretary of state for arms control, he tried to distortintelligence reports by intimidating analysts who disagreed with him. Afterthe invasion of Iraq, complaints that top advisers to thepresident had attempted to make intelligence reports conform to apreconceived conclusion about Saddam Hussein's weapons programs were often aimedin Bolton's direction.All of this is very much to the point. When thecountry chooses an ambassador to the United Nations, it oughtto avoid picking someone whose bullying style of leadership symbolizeseverything that created the current estrangement between the United Statesand most of the world. One of the goals ofBush's second term was supposed to be rapprochement with othernations, whose assistance the United States desperately needs to curbthe proliferation of the real weapons of mass destruction.Democrats on the Foreign Relations Committee are fighting to actually killBolton's nomination; all eyes are on Lincoln Chafee, the moderateRepublican swing vote who has a record of being verysupportive of the United Nations. In the case of Crawfordand Johnson, a few senators are threatening to block whatwould be easy confirmations by putting a hold on eachnomination before it goes to the Senate floor.The right to block a nomination, like the right to filibustera bill on the Senate floor, is one of thefew tools the minority party has for affecting public policy.But it needs to be used with discretion. Johnson, inparticular, seems like a bad choice for such a fight.His main drawback is that he is unlikely to putup the slightest resistance to Bush's policies, which have notbeen helpful in protecting the nation's clean air and water.Unfortunately, that will be the case whether this particular nominationgoes through or not, and the president clearly has thecapacity to find a less qualified yes-man for the job.Sens. Barbara Boxer of California and Ben Nelson of Florida arethreatening to stall Johnson's confirmation unless he promises to enda suspended Florida study in which families would be paidto allow researchers to study the effects of pesticides ontheir children -- a macabre investigation co-sponsored by the AmericanChemistry Council. The idea that the EPA would pay familiesto continue exposing their children to potentially dangerous chemicals ison its face outrageous -- and made worse by thestudy's ghoulish acronym, Cheers, for Children's Environmental Exposure Research Study.But the study has already been stopped, pending a review.It would have been a good sign of independence ifJohnson had called a complete halt, but there seems littlelikelihood that the study will ever be revived. This seemslike a weak reason to stop a Senate vote.In the case of the FDA, Sens. Hillary Clinton of NewYork and Patty Murray of Washington are threatening to keepthe nomination from the floor unless Crawford prompts his agencyto make a long-delayed decision on whether the so-called morning-afterpill may be sold over the counter.Their cause is righteous. If taken within 72 hours of unprotectedsex, the pills can end unwanted pregnancies -- so makingthem readily available could drastically cut down on the numberof abortions. Two committees of expert advisers voted overwhelmingly infavor of selling the medication over the counter, but theFDA has failed to do anything. Another proposal, which wouldlimit its sale to women over 16, has also beenpending.Crawford has been the deputy or acting commissioner during a verytroubled period for the drug agency. He presided over fiascosinvolving cox-2 painkillers, antidepressants, and other drugs. He is clearlyafraid to let his agency make a decision on themorning-after pill that will get him in hot water withsocial conservatives or with those who believe that the FDAshould be run on the basis of science, not theology.That timidity doesn't suggest that he would impose needed reformin other areas.The Senate should vote on Crawford and defeat his nomination onthe merits. If the Democratic senators are going to choosea disastrous Bush nomination to block, our choice is Bolton's.
Massachusetts lawmakers are pushing a bill that would allow certain pharmacistsin the state to dispense the ""morning-after pill"" without aprescription and require hospitals to offer it to rape victims,setting up a debate on a hot-button social issue thatcould present problems for Governor Mitt Romney as he mullsa presidential bid.When he ran for governor in 2002, Romney told Planned Parenthoodthat he supported expanding access to the emergency contraception pill,a high dose of hormones that women can take toprevent pregnancy up to five days after sex. But hedidn't elaborate, and Monday a spokesman for Romney said thegovernor was not prepared to disclose his position on themeasure because he wants to examine it if it reacheshis desk.The Legislature's joint public health committee will hold a hearing onthe bill Wednesday, and may vote as soon as May4 to send it to the House and Senate floors.The Senate approved the bill last year, but former HouseSpeaker Thomas M. Finneran, a devout Catholic, blocked a Housevote.Representative Peter Koutoujian, the Waltham Democrat who co-chairs the public healthpanel and backs the bill, said the bill has abetter chance of passing this time around. Sixteen senators and65 representatives have co-sponsored the bill.""Certainly the leadership is more supportive of this. Maybe it comesdown to where the governor stands, and whether we havetwo-thirds in support,"" Koutoujian said, referring to the margin necessaryfor the House and Senate to override a Romney veto.""But we seem to have a window of opportunity here,and I'm hopeful.""On a number of social issues, including gay marriage, sex education,and embryonic stem-cell research, Romney has struggled to find asliver of ground between the views of the Bay State'smoderate voters and the conservative voters who wield tremendous influencein the Republican presidential primaries. He faces a similar challengeon the question of emergency contraception.The Catholic Church and other abortion opponents oppose the pill becausethey believe it quashes a nascent human life by preventingthe implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus. Abortionrights groups argue it will reduce the number of abortionsby preventing unwanted pregnancies, and insist it is especially importantfor women who have been raped or abused.The Food and Drug Administration approved the use of the emergencycontraception pill as a form of prescription birth control in1998. But the FDA has refused to grant a requestby the pill's manufacturer to sell it over the counter,despite the overwhelming vote of an advisory panel in 2003recommending the move. In the absence of federal action, sixstates - Maine, California, Washington, Alaska, Hawaii, and New Mexico- have allowed pharmacists to dispense it without a prescription.Manufactured by Barr Laboratories, the emergency contraception pill, called Plan B,could prevent as many as 1.5-million unintended pregnancies a yearand prevent as many as 700,000 abortions nationally, according tomedical and women's organizations that petitioned the FDA in 2003.The emergency contraception pill is not to be confused withRU-486, which is used to end pregnancies up to 49days after the beginning of the last menstrual cycle.Under the Massachusetts legislation, only pharmacists who have gone through aspecial training program and have a collaborative agreement with adoctor would be allowed to distribute the emergency contraception pillwithout a prescription. The training program would be approved bythe commissioner of public health to ensure what the legislationcalls ""quality assurance."" The collaborative agreement would ensure that thepharmacist works with a doctor overseeing how the pill isdispensed.Most of the state's hospitals - 12 out of 71, accordingto a 2004 poll by abortion rights groups - alreadyoffer the pill to rape victims, but the bill wouldrequire that all of them do so.""It's very, very important to women, particularly women who are victimsof domestic violence. It's like being a victim twice ifyou've been raped, you go to a hospital, and youaren't offered emergency contraception,"" said Dianne Luby, the executive directorof the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts. ""It's just aquestion of access. Not every single woman lives within acouple of blocks of a pharmacy, and not every womancan easily access their doctor over the weekend.""Marie Sturgis, legislative director of Massachusetts Citizens for Life, described theeffects of the emergency contraception pill as ""a chemical abortion.""""This is going to abort that embryo that is trying toimplant in the uterus,"" Sturgis said.Although the pill may work for up to five days aftersex, its effectiveness declines over time. If taken within 24hours, it is 95 percent effective in preventing pregnancy, accordingto Planned Parenthood.On a questionnaire Planned Parenthood gave to the gubernatorial candidates in2002, Romney answered ""yes"" to the question, ""Do you supportefforts to increase access to emergency contraception?"" Romney says hepersonally opposes abortion, but on the questionnaire he also expressedsupport for ""the substance of the Supreme Court decision inRoe v. Wade"" and promised not to change the statusquo on abortion in Massachusetts.Scott Greenberger can be reached at greenbergerglobe.com.
EMERGENCY BIRTH CONTROLSINCE THE late 1990s, women in need of a""morning after"" emergency contraceptive have been able to get oneby doctor's prescription. But the pill {ndash} actually a shortseries of high-dose birth control pills {ndash} loses effectiveness withany delay. Access would be much better if the Foodand Drug Administration accepted a proposal {ndash} endorsed by theFDA's own experts {ndash} to make emergency contraception available overthe counter. Since political pressure has kept the FDA fromdoing so, there is need for state legislation that makesPlan B, as the treatment is called, somewhat more availableuntil the FDA sees fit to allow over-the-counter sales.Under a bill pending in the Legislature, pharmacists would be allowedto sell Plan B without prescriptions if they undergo specialtraining set up by the state Department of Public Healthand establish a relationship with a doctor who would overseehow the pill is dispensed. Such arrangements are already inplace in six other states, including Washington and California. Thetraining in Washington has focused on Plan B's side effects(nausea and breast tenderness) and informed consent issues. The billwould also require that all hospital emergency rooms in Massachusettsoffer emergency contraception to the victims of rape or sexualassault. Most emergency rooms in the state already do so.The bill deserves the support of the Legislature and GovernorRomney.Plan B prevents 89 percent of pregnancies when it is takenwithin 72 hours of intercourse, either by interfering with ovulationor by blocking fertilization. In some cases, it might alsowork by keeping a fertilized egg from implanting in awoman's uterus. This has kept some opponents of abortion fromsupporting use of Plan B. Supporters of Plan B saythat easier access to it would reduce the number ofunplanned pregnancies and abortions. The legislation has won support fromorganizations representing women, the medical profession, and pharmacists.Morning-after pills are far from ideal as a means of birthcontrol. Their effectiveness rate is lower than that of othermeasures, and they do not prevent sexually transmitted diseases, ascondoms do. But they should be a readily available optionfor women.Last year the state Senate passed an emergency contraception bill, butthe former House speaker, Thomas M. Finneran, blocked action onit in that chamber. With Finneran departed, advocates of thebill hope that it will pass both houses. As acandidate for governor in 2002, Romney answered ""yes"" to aquestionnaire from the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts that askedhim whether he supported ""efforts to increase access to emergencycontraception."" The Legislature should pass the bill and, if itdoes, Romney should sign it.
It was the kind of election-year event thatillustrates the power of incumbency.There were testimonials hailing Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's leadership, standing ovations,billboard-size video displays of the New York mayor -- anda chance for him to tell a ballroom filled withabortion-rights supporters that in his role as mayor he wasgoing to have the city spend $1 million to helpmake women aware of the ""morning-after pill.""Bloomberg, running for a second term, was honored Thursday by NaralPro-Choice New York for creating a program in 2001 thatmade abortion training available to doctors in residency in cityhospitals. ""I wanted to do this myself,"" said Kelli Conlin,the executive director of the group, as she called themayor to the stage, ""because I wanted you to knowfrom the bottom of our hearts in this organization howmuch your leadership has meant on this issue.""Bloomberg could not help but smile. ""I can at least goback and report that this is a friendly crowd,"" hesaid.Early polls have indicated that Bloomberg, a Republican running in anoverwhelmingly Democratic city, could be vulnerable to a popular Democraticcandidate, even though the Democrats seeking the nomination have beenstruggling to find a message that resonates. Bloomberg's party affiliationand his reluctance to criticize Republicans in Congress over issuesthat many say are important to New York leave himopen to criticism and more.But Thursday, Bloomberg had a chance to tell an important constituencythat he is more in sync with their thinking thanwith that of many Republicans leading the party nationally, especiallyon abortion.The mayor picked an issue -- availability of the morning-after pill-- that is being debated across the country. ""He hasstepped into the fray, sided with science and women's health,and is pushing a program that will directly reduce thenumber of unintended pregnancies and abortions in our city,"" saidRobert Jaffee, deputy director of Naral Pro-Choice New York.""I make this promise,"" Bloomberg said at the meeting. ""As mayorand as a private citizen, I will continue to dowhat I can to make a difference, whether in thecity, in Albany, in Washington or anywhere that the rightsor our daughters, our sisters, our friends or our colleaguesare threatened.""After the ceremony, Conlin was asked if the unqualified praise forthe mayor amounted to an endorsement. She said the group'sendorsement committee had not yet met, but added, ""We arehappy and proud to stand with him today.""
Increasingly we are governed by ideologies that don'tin any way reflect mainstream American thought.When Congress made its clumsy bull's rush into the Terri Schiavomatter, 70 percent of Americans said it should have stayedout.Roughly that same number supports life-saving stem-cell research that is beingblunted on the grounds of biblical verses.Now in several states, including Texas, lawmakers are being urged toequate birth-control pills and abortion. This is a distinction I'mconfident a vast majority of American women will classify asridiculous and/or immaterial.In Texas, the debate has formed around a bill under whoseoriginal language pharmacists could refuse to fill prescriptions for emergencycontraception (EC) -- the so-called morning-after pill. House Bill 16would be appended to current law allowing health professionals toopt out of performing an abortion.Family planning organizations not only opposed the ""conscience clause"" on ECbut feared that the language could be broadened to includestandard birth-control pills, as is the case in a handfulof states.Abortion foes, including an organization called Pharmacists for Life, assert thatwhile birth-control pills and EC do prevent conception in severalways, they also can prevent a fertilized egg from implanting-- therefore aborting human life.With much attention aimed at whether or not his bill wouldaffect birth-control pills, bill author Frank Corte, R-San Antonio, offereda version that took out references to EC. Instead, itsimply would add pharmacists to the health professionals who canchoose not to perform abortions. But abortion isn't something pharmacistsdo anyway -- unless one equates birth-control pills and abortions.If passed, seemingly, a pharmacist could cite HB 16 in refusingto fill out a prescription for EC or contraception.It is skirmishes like this that ought to get a lotof Americans wondering who is running the country, and towhat end.In a visit to Texas and a stopover in Waco, NationalAbortion Rights Action League president Nancy Keenan called this thenewest front in the war against choice. It's ""not justabout a woman's right to choose an abortion,"" she said.""It's about denying birth control.""Keenan said her organization has reformulated its own message to putpregnancy prevention at the forefront.""We've been debating the abortion issue for years and fought iton their (abortion opponents') terms. Now we're going on theoffensive"" on behalf of prevention and education.It is somewhat amazing that anyone would have to bring suchissues to the forefront of any debate. Stand up forcontraception, something on which millions of women depend to controltheir reproductive futures? You mean people weren't already on theirfeet? On this issue and more, average Americans have beenplanted on the sofa as armies of zeal have dictateddebate.Do Texans think a pharmacist should be able to refuse tofill a prescription for birth-control pills? According to the TexasPoll, 87 percent say no. Something tells me that's notguaranteed to carry the day in Austin.John Young writes for The Waco Tribune-Herald. E-mail: jyoung@wacotrib.com.
A pharmacist in Illinois has filed a lawsuit challengingan order by Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich requiring pharmacies todispense birth control and emergency contraceptives without delay.The pharmacist, Luke Vander Bleek, 42, says in his lawsuit thatthe order violates state law by requiring pharmacists to actagainst ethical and religious beliefs that oppose morning-after birth controlpills. The lawsuit, filed Wednesday, is the third contesting thegovernor's action.""I'm not up on a soap box in the pharmacy screamingout 'This is not to be done,""' said Vander Bleek,who owns two pharmacies in Morrison and Prophetstown, about 130miles west of Chicago. ""I simply don't want to beinvolved in it.""Vander Bleek said he conscientiously objected to the order, which wasissued in April after two women reported that a drugstorein Chicago would not fill their prescriptions for morning-after pills.""Prior to this rule, I had always practiced pharmacy using myjudgment and my conscience and the law as my guide,""he said. ""Here comes this grenade thrown in here thatsays, 'You're going to have to do things that aremorally objectionable.""'Abby Ottenhoff, a spokeswoman for Blagojevich, a Democrat, said the governorissued the order to make sure women had access tothe health care their doctors prescribed.""They've chosen to be in the field of providing contraceptives,"" Ottenhoffsaid. ""They don't have the right to pick and choosewho they're going to serve.""Vander Bleek, who is represented by Americans United for Life, aconservative bioethics law firm based in Chicago, said he hadnot dispensed or stocked emergency contraceptives and did not planto do so. No one has come to his pharmacywith such prescriptions since the order was issued, he said.""Simply stated, this individual's interest in getting this prescription is notgreater than my interest in preserving my right to conscientiousobjection,"" he said.Also on Wednesday, a nurse in Illinois filed a lawsuit againstEastern Illinois University, where she used to work, claiming shewas denied a promotion because she objected to dispensing themorning-after pill.Vicki Woodard, a spokeswoman for the university, said the reason thatthe nurse, Andrea Nead, was not hired for the positionhad nothing to do with her opinion of the morning-afterpill. One of the two people hired for the positionalso objects to dispensing it, Woodard said.The American Center for Law and Justice, the conservative legal grouprepresenting Nead, represents six pharmacists in a separate lawsuit againstthe governor's order. Another suit was filed by the Centerfor Law and Religious Freedom, representing a Chicago pharmacist.
","In 2003, two expert panels at the FDA recommended that Plan B, the morning-after pill, be available over-the-counter. In 2005, the FDA still had not issued a ruling. In a Congressional hearing, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton wondered if was ""a dangerous slide into political opinion as opposed to scientific evidence."" In the absence of federal action, six states have allowed pharmacists to dispense Plan B without a prescription. The religious right led the effort, nationally and in at least 11 states, to give protection to pharmacists who refuse to fill prescriptions for Plan B because of religious beliefs. ","The FDA was supposed to make a decision on the revised OTC proposal in January 2005, but it did not. In February the acting FDA Commissioner was nominated to be Commissioner. He declared the subject of the pill ""complex"" and could not say when a decision would be made. Some senators refused to vote for confirmation until a decision was announced. As the FDA stalled, debate continued and states began to debate local action and such peripheral issues as whether pharmacists are compelled to sell products to which they have moral objections. ","On March 31, 2005, Senate Democrats questioned the nominee for FDA chief on the lack of a decision on over-the-counter (OTC) sales of the morning-after pill, recommended by his staff and available with a prescription since the 1990's. He called the delay complex. Six states already allow OTC sales, with politicians in other states campaigning on this question. Discussions are heating up over pharmacists refusing to dispense this pill, even with a prescription. Four states have laws giving them that right and 11 states are considering this legislation. One pharmacist is suing the Governor of Illinois for this capability. ","Several Democratic senators including Kennedy, Clinton, Mikulski, and Murray wanted to delay confirmation of President Bush's nominee to head the FDA until a decision was made on whether the morning-after pill could be sold without prescription. Some pharmacists around the country were refusing to fill prescriptions for any birth control pills, claiming that they violate their beliefs. At least eleven states allow pharmacists to refuse to fill prescriptions for religious reasons. Massachusetts may join six other states in allowing the pill to be sold without a prescription and four states are considering laws requiring pharmacists to fill all prescriptions. "
D0903,D0903-A,"Portugal, one of the most oil-dependent nations in Europe, will begin work on the world's biggest solar energy power station next year, officials said Tuesday.The plant will have 350,000 solar panels spread over 114 hectares (280 acres) near the southern town of Moura and will be able to produce 62 megawatts, more than six times the largest existing solar power station in Germany.""The construction of the station will begin in 2006, it is irreversible,"" Moura mayor Jose Maria Pos-de-Mina was quoted as saying by Lusa news agency.The plant is expected to be completed in 2009 and will have a total cost of 250 million euros (307 million dollars). It will be built by BP Solar, a unit of energy giant BP, and it is expected to create 240 permanent jobs in the southern province of Alentejo, one of Europe's poorest regions.""This is a unique project and the world's most ambitious in terms of final capacity,"" said BP Solar commercial director for southern Europe, Francisco Conesa, according to Lusa.Southern Portugal's thinly populated Alentejo region has been identified as one of Europe's most promising regions for solar energy.The town of Moura owns the majority of the firm which will oversee the solar power station project, Amper Central Solar.Under the United Nations Kyoto Protocol, the international treaty on global warming which Lisbon has signed, Portugal must generate 39 percent of its electricity needs through renewable energy sources like solar and wind power.
A team from Holland, known more for its windmills than its sunshine, on Wednesday won a four-day international solar-powered car race across Australia's deserts, notching up their third straight victory.High-tech cars from Australia, the United States and Japan were hot on its heels as the sliver-shaped, space-age Nuna 3 arrived in the southern city of Adelaide after the 3,000 kilometre (1,860 mile) race, organiser Chris Selwood told AFP.Shunning petrol, sucking up the sun and racing at speeds up to 120 kilometres (74 miles) an hour, 20 cars from 10 countries set out from Darwin in Australia's far north on Sunday in the eighth World Solar Challenge.The Dutch team behind Nuna 3 appeared to have broken its own record of 30 hours and 54 minutes set during the last race in 2003, Selwood said.The ""Challenge"", to design and build a car capable of crossing Australia on the power of daylight, was launched in 1987 and teams and individuals from corporations and universities throughout the world take part.Australian entry Aurora 101, which came second in the last two races, was holding on to the same position this year while a car from the University of Michigan, which won the North American Solar Challenge in July, was in third place, Selwood said.A team from Ashiya University in Osaka, Japan, which qualified fastest with its Sky Ace Tiga car, was running fourth.Tail-enders still making their way through the vast Outback could reach the finish line a day later.The teams raced from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm each day through some of Australia's most forbidding terrain on the main Stuart Highway from Darwin to Adelaide before camping each night where they were in the desert.Event spokeswoman Rowena Austin said the challenge was an important testing ground for alternative fuel technologies.""It's particularly relevant with the oil price where it is at the moment,"" she said.
Spain has provided a US$54.4 million (euro43.4 million) long-term loan to fund asolar power project for remote villages in the central and southern Philippines,officials said Friday.The four-year project, which began in 2003, will initially cover communitiesthat have benefited from the government's agrarian reform program in 16provinces on the main southern island of Mindanao, acting Land Reform SecretaryNasser Pangandaman said.The project will provide electricity for the first time to more than 277,900rural households, plus schools, potable water systems and health, village andlivelihood centers, said Dioscora Tobias of the government's Solar PowerTechnology Support project.The Philippines will provide a US$8.7 million (euro6.9 million) counterpart fundfor the project, which will also help the country diversify its energysources.Tobias, who monitors and evaluates the solar power project, said it also willprovide schools in remote areas with television sets and video players to beused as teaching aids.A rural household with a solar panel installed typically will have enoughelectricity to power four light bulbs and backup batteries to provide power fora week of bad weather. Health centers also will be provided with refrigeratorsfor vaccines, Tobias said.
With well-developed wafer andsemiconductor industries, Taiwan has great promise in solar energydevelopment, the chief executive officer of Taiwan's leadingcrystalline silicon solar cell manufacturing company said Monday.Speaking in an interview with CNA, Motech Industries Inc.President Leo Cheng said he urged the government to invest more insolar energy research when his company began investing in the fieldseven years ago.""Taiwan is very suitable for solar power development because ithas the world's best wafer fabrication plants and a large number ofskilled engineers. With this precious asset, I see no other countrybetter equipped than Taiwan to develop solar energy,"" Cheng said.In the past two years, Cheng said, more and more local companieshave got involved in solar energy development, enhancing thepossibility of forming a comprehensive industry supply chain.""So long as we can develop a complete supply chain, the solarenergy industry will become yet another of Taiwan's star industrieslike the electronics industry,"" Cheng said.Motech Industries Inc., founded in 1981 and formerly known asMeter International Corp., is a leading Taiwanese manufacturerspecializing in high-end test and measurement instruments. Over thepast 20 years, Motech Industries has expanded its product base tobecome one of the most reputable test and measurement manufacturersin Taiwan, with a growing international presence.In 1998, Motech received permission to set up its SolarElectricity Division (Motech Solar) in the South Taiwan Science Park.Motech Solar is Taiwan's first manufacturer specializing in theproduction of crystalline silicon solar cells.Its main products include multi- and mono-crystalline siliconsolar cells with dimensions of 125mm x 125mm and 156mm x 156mm.Cheng said Motech Solar plans to further expand its productioncapacity by the end of 2005.Motech Solar has also started a pilot production line for waferslicing to reduce cost and increase the supply of silicon wafers,Cheng said.Moreover, Cheng went on, Motech Solar plans to begin theconstruction of a second factory building for future expansion insolar wafer and cell manufacturing.""One of our goals is to become the lowest-cost solar cellmanufacturer in the world,"" Cheng said.With the Kyoto Protocol taking effect and crude oil pricesskyrocketing, Cheng said there is a resurgence of interest in solarenergy. As a result, upstream solar energy materials have been inshort supply and he predicted that investment in upstream solarenergy materials production will reap certain dividends.He urged the government to invest more in solar energy researchand provide incentives to encourage private investment in the fieldso that Taiwan can develop a complete solar energy supply chain soon.Cheng further said his company is expected to rank among the world'stop five solar energy firms by 2008.
It was an invention just waiting to be patented. With electronicdevices hitting the trails, someone had to put on the market a neat,portable source of electricity.Voila! The solar backpack. It sounds ungainly, but two companieshave made a go of it.Clear Blue Hawaii offers the Blue Sun Solarpac ($260, battery notincluded) and Voltaic Systems offers the Voltaic Backpack ($229,battery included).Both can charge your GPS unit and other gadgets while you hike,bike or sit using an internal battery, and both can charge direct fromthe solar cells in daylight. They are also the same size -- 1,850cubic inches.But beyond these similarities, the packs are quite different, whichcan be challenging for the consumer. First, Blue Sun's solar panel,batteries and harness can be removed and used with other Clear BlueHawaii products, saving $200 on a second bag. The same items in theVoltaic are fixed.Second, while both packs operate with an internal lithium-ionbattery, each battery option is slightly different. The Blue Sun canaccept a $50 or $150 lithium-ion battery; the $150 battery stores moreelectricity and has a wider output (up to 12 volts) than the $50battery (up to 7.2 volts). Voltaic's battery, which ranges from 3.5-to 7.2-volts, can't match Blue Sun's $150 battery in output or outputrange, nor can it match Blue Sun's $50 battery in overall output butbests it in output range.Blue Sun's solar panel yields twice the power of Voltaic's threepanels when tested in identical conditions. In addition, the type ofpanel that Blue Sun uses is more energy-efficient than Voltaic'smonocrystalline panels.All that said, given the fact that the Blue Sun has a better solarpanel and batteries that yield more output, I would recommend the BlueSun pack. With its $50 battery, you can charge most of yourhand-helds, and if you purchase the $150 battery, you will be able torecharge a 12-volt device, such as a satellite phone. But thisrecommendation assumes you've got your heart set on a solar backpack.The truth is, the limited size of these packs makes themimpractical for anything beyond overnight outings, where you couldeasily pack extra batteries to meet your electrical needs.But on outings lasting a week or more, these packs could save usersfrom having to haul 10 pounds or so in batteries (even though youcouldn't use the packs because you wouldn't have enough space for theprovisions you'd need).When Clear Blue Hawaii and Voltaic Systems produce solar packs atleast three times the size of these, they will have a product withreal appeal to backpackers. Until then, the Blue Sun and Voltaicbackpacks are little more than novelty items with the promise ofuseful packs to come.
As prices for coal, natural gas and oil have soared, solarpower has been getting perhaps its most serious look frominvestors since President Carter pulled on a cardigan and askedAmericans to damp their furnaces. The new interest means thatthe handful of domestic solar stocks has been surging, too.Over the last year, the shares of Evergreen Solar, DayStar Technologies,Energy Conversion Devices and Spire -- all small domestic companiesthat make equipment for converting solar power into electricity --have more than doubled in price. In August, Cypress Semiconductorsaid it would try to raise as much as $100million in an initial public offering for its SunPower subsidiary.""The solar market is projected to grow 35 percent a yearfor the next three to five years,"" said Walter V.Nasdeo, managing director of Ardour Capital, an investment bank inNew York that specializes in energy companies. ""As these technologiesget better, we're seeing things being developed like solar panelsintegrated into roofing tiles. That way, they don't look likea science project hanging on your roof.""Back in the days of Carter's cardigan, the country was miredin an energy crisis, with an oil embargo and longlines at gas stations. Today, tumult in oil-producing places likethe Middle East and Venezuela is roiling markets. Strong demandfor electricity has contributed to increases in the prices ofcoal and natural gas. And Hurricane Katrina, of course, hasworsened the situation. Yet these dire developments have been aboon for companies that make devices like silicon wafers androoftop panels that convert solar energy.Until recently, the economics of the solar business did not temptmany consumers or investors. Without government or utility subsidies, the$20,000 to $25,000 that it costs to buy and installa typical home solar-power system may be too high tobe recouped at the end of a 30-year mortgage.But government help, combined with the recent climb in energy prices,has made solar more appealing. Some states offer big subsidies,helping to defray much of the initial cost of ahome system.Some electric utilities also offer incentives. In theory, solar-energy systems freethem from having to invest in additional generating capacity. Homeownerstypically connect their systems to the power grid and buyelectricity when their panels do not produce enough power; theysell electricity to their utility when they have a surplus.Federal law requires utilities to buy excess power generated by consumersusing solar power, although rates vary from state to state,said Joseph E. Schwartz, chief executive and technical editor ofHome Power magazine. And the new federal energy law, signedby President Bush last month, includes a tax credit ofas much as $2,000 for the purchase and installation ofa residential solar-power system.""Despite all of the concerns about imported oil and climate change,most people make their decision to install solar based onwhether they're going to save money,"" said Steven C. Taub,director of emerging power generation technologies at Cambridge Energy ResearchAssociates.In states with generous subsidies, he said, solar power may beattractive for many consumers. In New Jersey, for example, subsidiescan cover as much as 70 percent of the cost,leaving consumers with a net cost of about $6,000 ona typical home system.Though the four little domestic solar-power companies stand to benefit fromnew demand for power, they account for only a fractionof the world's solar-device production. The biggest of the four,Energy Conversion Devices, has a market capitalization of only about$1.1 billion.Giants like BP and Royal Dutch Shell in the energy industry,or Sharp and Kyocera in electronics, make most solar gear.Last year, the solar industry produced 1,195 megawatts of newelectricity-generation capacity, about the equivalent of one large power plant,Taub said. Sharp alone accounted for about 325 megawatts, hesaid.Yet solar energy conversion is a tiny part of these heftycompanies' sales, so the little independents are a purer play.The business lines of Evergreen and DayStar are almost entirelyrelated to solar power (as are those of Cypress' SunPower).Energy Conversion Devices has other products, but its largest subsidiary,United Solar Ovonics, also known as Uni-Solar, is a solar-powerbusiness. And Spire's solar division accounted for an average of40 percent of the company's sales in 2003 and 2004.Of course, investing in small-capitalization stocks can be risky. Besides beingmicrobes in an industry dominated by giants, none of thefour independents were profitable last year. Two have short historiesas public companies: Evergreen went public in 2002, and DayStardid so last year. All but Spire are developing newsolar technologies, and there is no guarantee that customers willembrace their innovations.Understanding their plans requires a bit of knowledge about the waysolar power works. The most popular means of converting thesun's energy into electricity -- silicon-based solar panels -- hasprogressed over the last three decades but has not changedradically. Silicon is used to make wafers, which are wiredto create solar cells. These form the building blocks forsolar panels, which look like big storm windows as theysit atop roofs and soak up the sun.A silicon shortage has driven up the cost of solar-grade siliconby more than 60 percent over the last two years,said Michael Rogol, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia.That offers an opportunity to companies like Evergreen and SunPowerthat have devised more efficient ways to use silicon, hesaid.Evergreen's wafer-making method consumes about a third less silicon than usual,said Richard M. Feldt, its president and chief executive. Manycompetitors slice blocks of silicon into wafers; that creates wastein the same way a lumberyard spits out sawdust. Evergreen'smethod, which draws out long ribbons of silicon and slicesthem with lasers, produces less waste.Executives at Cypress Semiconductor in Sunnyvale, Calif., declined to be interviewedbecause of an impending stock offering. But Rogol said itsSunPower unit makes the industry's most efficient cells, yielding 210watts of power a square meter, versus 180 for atypical cell.DayStar, for its part, uses no silicon, while Uni-Solar uses farless than average. DayStar, based in Halfmoon, N.Y., applies athin film of several elements, including copper, to backings suchas titanium foil to create flexible solar cells.Uni-Solar marries the thin-film method with silicon. ""Our panels are typically18 feet long with an adhesive on the back,"" saidSubhendu Guha, its president. ""You can stick it directly ontothe roof. With the traditional product, you have to havea support structure.""Spire, in Bedford, Mass., produces neither silicon wafers nor solar cells.It makes machinery for building and testing solar panels. In1999, that enabled it to work with the city ofChicago to equip and run a panel factory there. RogerG. Little, Spire's chairman and chief executive, says he seesthe Chicago venture as a harbinger of Spire's future; heaims to increase panel production over the next two years.That would return Spire to its roots. The company started in1969; early on, it concentrated on solar-power conversion. It diversifiedinto biomedical equipment and electronics after the energy crisis ofthe late 1970s abated and enthusiasm for solar power cooled.""The market tanked,"" Little recalled. Even so, he remained confident.""I've always believed that solar is a freight train that can'tbe stopped,"" he said. ""It started small, but the compoundannual growth rate for the last 10 years has been20 percent. This year, there's a $10 billion worldwide marketfor systems.""
Soaring energy prices and bright sunny days aregiving new meaning to the gold in ""Golden State."" Ona day when their morning newspapers reported a projected 70percent increase in natural gas bills, more than 160 centralSan Joaquin Valley residents spent Saturday checking out the possibilitiesof generating their own electricity through solar power.As the sun pushed temperatures into the 80s and low 90s,these conservation-minded citizens toured nine homes and two commercial locationsthat are converting sunlight to electricity through photovoltaic cells. Peopletaking the tour said they were concerned about rising energybills and wanted to see how much money they couldsave by going solar.""It's about cost and future costs,"" said Randy Neely of Fresno,when asked about his interest in solar energy systems. ""Ifthe break-even point for solar systems is 12-13 years intoday's dollars, imagine what it's going to be in thefuture if the price of oil keeps going up.""Neely said that with the possibility of a solar power systempaying for itself in fewer years, given the current energyprice situation, he and his wife, Nola, are seriously consideringinstalling photovoltaic roof panels on their next house.""That's why the tour is so beneficial,"" said Nola Neely. ""Youget to take a look at real homes and askthe homeowners what is good about their systems and whatthey wish they would have done differently.""Allen and Mary Jones of Fresno have long been aware ofthe benefits of solar power. For years, Allen Jones hasused a solar oven for cooking.""I've been looking at solar power systems for a long timebut so far I haven't seen the payoff,"" he says.When he does, Jones says, he won't hesitate to gosolar.With energy costs on the rise, more and more people willbe looking for ways to reduce their power bills, saidJeff Adolph of Fresno.Adolph, the facilities energy manager for Pacific Gas and Electric Co.,has done all he can to reduce his home energybill, including taking advantage of PG&E's time-of-use rates, which arelower when electricity is not used from noon to 6p.m. For years, Adolph's family has gone without air conditioningduring hot summer afternoons.""I'm looking into solar energy as a way to be alittle more comfortable in the summer,"" he says.Saturday's self-guided solar home tour, the first of its kind inthe central San Joaquin Valley, was sponsored by the cityof Fresno, American Solar Energy Society, Northern California Solar EnergyAssociation and the Great Valley Center.Interest in solar energy is increasing rapidly in California, said MarkStout, a clean-energy consultant from Fresno and coordinator of thetour.""In 2001, we were generating 10 megawatts of solar electricity inthe state,"" he said. ""Today it's over 100 megawatts.""A megawatt is 1 million watts of electricity, or enough energyto power 300 homes.Stout said there are some 500 solar electricity systems in operationin Fresno and Madera counties, up dramatically from a fewyears ago when there were just a handful of installations.Given increasing electric rates, decreasing costs of solar panels and economicincentives available to homeowners through tax credits and rebates, Stoutexpects installations of solar power systems to increase rapidly inthe next few years.Using the sun to generate electricity is producing big energy savingsfor OK Produce, said general manager Brady Matoian, whose massivecommercial solar power system drew several visitors Saturday. In 2002,the company installed 35,000 square feet of photovoltaic cells onthe roof of its building in downtown Fresno. The system,the largest of its kind in the Valley, has reducedenergy consumption by nearly half and produced an annual savingsof $65,000.Matoian participated in the tour as a way to help getthe word out to people about the benefits of solarpower.""Solar energy works perfectly in the Valley,"" he said. ""We getnine months of sunshine every year. Our agriculture is basedon the sun. What we're doing on the roof isfarming the sun. It makes perfect sense.""
The first Saturday in October was clear, dry and drenched inbright sunlight -- ideal for the solar panels converting lightto electricity at Harry Kubetz and Gary Burton's home inNorthport, N.Y.""Today is a peak power day,"" Burton said, looking up ata rooftop covered with 80 solar panels. ""We're probably producingenough power to meet our demand for the day.""In fact, according to the digital meter on the side ofthe house, the panels were making more electricity than thehouse needed. A small black arrow pointed left, indicating thatexcess electricity was being sent back to the Long IslandPower Authority.The Northport home was one of 67 stops on a solarenergy tour across Long Island. The free tour, set upby Renewable Energy Long Island, an alternative energy advocacy group,was self-guided, covering residences and businesses with solar systems inNassau and Suffolk Counties.Lower prices for solar equipment, higher efficiency and tax and rebateincentives from government and utility companies have caused more LongIslanders to look to lower their energy costs with solarpower.Over the last year, demand ""has skyrocketed"" for these systems, saidJonathan Lane, who owns Quad State Solar, the company thatinstalled the system for Kubetz and Burton. ""Within the lastthree months, there has been a huge increase in thenumber of inquiries and in the number of sales,"" hesaid.Another sign that prices are going down and demand is increasingis the lower rebate offered by the power authority. Kubetzand Burton received $5 per watt for their 10 kilowattsystem -- or $50,000.Their system cost $81,000 to install. Of that, a total of$27,250 came out of their pockets after the rebate anda state tax credit of $3,750, a maximum that willrise to $5,000 in September 2006. A federal tax creditof 30 percent of the cost of a solar system,up to $2,000 for homes, will also apply after Jan.1.But today, with 560 homes and businesses powered by solar energyon Long Island, the LIPA rebate is down to $4per watt, and the utility expects to lower it furtherto $3.75 in mid- to late 2006 if solar systemprices continue to go down, said Daniel Zaweski, the directorof energy efficiency and distributed generation programs at the powerauthority.The average 5 kilowatt residential solar system costs nearly $40,000 tobuy and install, according to Gordian Raacke, director of RenewableEnergy Long Island. The homeowner would pay about $15,000 aftera $20,000 LIPA rebate and state and federal tax credits.Such a system can reduce electric bills by 20 to 100percent, according to Sharon Laudisi of the Long Island PowerAuthority, depending on the amount and duration of sunlight hittingthe solar panels and on electricity use in the home.Solar energy systems, also called ""PVs,"" short for photovoltaic cells, convertsunlight to electricity without combustion, creating power without pollution. Thereare also solar systems for heating water and pools.Solar panels do not store energy, and they supply electricity onlywhen the sun is shining on them. Since most homeshave their solar systems connected to the LIPA grid, theydraw energy back from the authority at night or oncloudy days, using the credits earned while supplying electricity duringthe day.Kubetz and Burton like the modern look that the sleek reflectivesolar panels add to the back of their suburban ranch.Besides saving about $2,000 a year on utility bills, there'sthe matter of conscience.""I could personally afford to pay a larger bill,"" Kubetz said,""but I think Americans consume way too much energy.""
The solar-power industry needed stability to become competitive, the Vice President of Royal Dutch Shell's Hydrogen Business Jeremy Bentham said here on Wednesday.Jeremy Bentham told the World Petroleum Congress in Johannesburg: ""The solar industry needs stable markets. With fair and good incentives we can have solar power competitive in ten year's time.""He said over the course of time different companies gave different incentives to get markets moving, and that these incentives changed, upsetting the industry.Reasons for countries to shift to renewable sources of energy included the need to preserve energy independence as well as the increase of air pollution in cities.Renewable energy production would be on the same level as gas production by 2030, and as oil by 2040, Bentham predicted.""We are not constrained by capital, but by opportunities as we grow,"" Bentham said.Electricity generation from wind power was reaching its target of being competitive. Turbines in the Thames estuary were providing electricity to a quarter of homes in the greater London area.Bentham stressed that government policies would play a major role in advancing the use of renewable energy, and that fact-basedand not emotion-based discussions were required around the issue.
Italy has unveiled Europe's first solar-power train, according to Italian News Agency ANSA on Thursday.The solar panels on the train's roof do not drive it but provide energy for its air conditioning, illumination and safety systems.Italian Environment Minister Altero Matteoli said the first tenprototypes would pave the way for ""significant"" developments in the future.The CEO of Italian train company Trenitalia, Roberto Testore, said it was ""looking with interest to the solar power sector, witha view to producing vehicles on an industrial scale.""Solar panels are already used to provide a portion of train power in Japan. A miniature railway in Wales is wholly powered by solar energy.At Thursday's presentation, Testore also said Trenitalia was investing heavily to renew its fleet and raise safety levels.He said the number of accidents had dropped by half in the lasteight years.
","With rising prices of natural gas and oil, interest is increasing in alternative fuels. The market for solar power is expected by some to grow 35% a year in the next five years. Earlier, $20,000, the minimum cost to install a home solar-power system, was too high; but now higher efficiency and tax and rebate incentives from government and utilities help reduce that cost. California has many solar electricity systems already in operation. Interest is widespread. Portugal plans the world's biggest solar energy power station. Taiwan claims the best silicon solar cell plant. Italy has Europe's first solar-powered train. ","Spain loaned the Philippines $4.4 million for a solar project to provide electricity to nearly 300 thousand rural households, schools, potable water systems, and health centers. Portugal planned to begin work on the world's biggest solar power station in 2006. The project, built by BP, was expected to create 240 jobs. The California counties of Fresno and Madera operate 500 solar electricity systems and Long Island powers 560 homes and businesses by solar energy. Italy developed a solar power train that powers air conditioning, illumination, and safety systems. Japan and Wales use solar panels for a portion of train power. ","Interest in solar power is increasing with large scale projects planned in Portugal and the Philippines. Large energy giants like BP and Royal Dutch Shell are involved in producing equipment. The agricultural valleys of California are considered favorable for solar power. Home conversions to solar power will probably require subsidies to offset initial costs but will lead to low monthly bills. Improvements in semiconductors will aid solar development. Solar panels on trains in Italy and Japan provide for air conditioning, illumination and safety systems. Solar cars and backpacks have been developed. ","Expectations are high for the growth of solar power. Petroleum industry officials warn solar could become competitive by 2015. In the US, the solar market is expected to grow by 35% a year. In California, production increased from 10 megawatts in 2001 to 100 in 2005. In New York, demand for home systems skyrocketed this year. Portugal is planning a 62 megawatt power station for completion in 2009. In the Philippines, a $63.1 million project is bringing power to rural areas. Taiwan is developing the solar industry chain. Other projects include solar powered trains, cars, and backpack battery chargers. "
D0903,D0903-B,"The Portuguese government has granted an operating license for a huge solarenergy power station that its backers claim will be the world'slargest.The Economy and Innovation Ministry said Wednesday it approved a project toinstall solar panels over 114 hectares (280 acres) in southeastern Portugal, oneof Europe's sunniest spots.The power plant, costing euro250 million (US$302 million), is to have a capacityof 62 megawatts when it comes on line in 2007. The electricity it generates isto be fed into the national grid.The project was developed by Amper Central Solar, a company 90-percent owned bythe town council of Moura, where the plant is to be built. The region is one ofEurope's poorest.BP Solar is to provide the panels and also will set up a nearby solar panelfactory employing 115 people. The factory is expected to achieve an annualturnover of euro63 million (US$76 million).The government is encouraging the development of renewable energy sources toreduce the nation's dependence on imported oil.Portugal has no oil, natural gas or coal. It imports about 86 percent of itsenergy, according to government figures, and high oil prices are hinderingefforts to revive the stagnant economy.
Greece's president and prime minister have agreed to install solar panels attheir official residences following a plea by the environmental groupGreenpeace, the development ministry said Tuesday.""The president agreed, with great pleasure, to proceed with a feasibility studyon installing solar power cells at the presidential residence,"" DevelopmentMinister Dimitris Sioufas said after meeting President KarolosPapoulias.He said Prime Minister Costas Caramanlis and the speaker of Greece's parliamenthad also agreed to go solar.Last week, Greenpeace criticized Greece's government for failing to promote theuse of the sun in power generation. The environmental group said it would payfor solar panels to be installed at Caramanlis' residence.
With the government's efforts to promoterenewable energy, the installation density of solar water heaters inTaiwan is the third-highest in the world, Vice Economics Minister HouHo-shong said Wednesday.Addressing a seminar held by the Chung Hua Institution forEconomic Research on the impact of soaring oil prices on the economy,Hou pointed out that the government is trying to work out plans forenergy conservation and the enhancement of energy efficiency to copewith the high oil prices.These include a plan to amend the Energy Management Law toregulate energy efficiency and to enact a renewable energydevelopment law with the goal of seeing renewable energy generationreach 5,130 megawatts, or 10 percent of the total capacity generatedby the country's power stations, by 2010, Hou said.Hou noted that the government is promoting the use of variousrenewable energy sources, including wind force, solar power, solarthermal, biomass energy and geothermal energy.The government is also planning to set up a solar-heating indoorswimming pool this year, Hou said.Hou said the government has subsidized the installation of 74solar power systems with a total generation capacity of 647kilowatts, including one at the Presidential Office, and is carryingout a ""solar-powered city"" project in Tainan County.Also, the government is expected to complete the country's firstgeothermal power plant in Ilan County in 2007, he said.Meanwhile, Hou said, the government is planning to replace allthe traffic lights around the country with energy-conserving lightemitting diodes (LEDs) next year.With the international oil prices rising to as high as US$70 perbarrel in August and fluctuating around US$57 per barrel at present,the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Ministry of Finance havesuggested that the Cabinet lower the taxes on gasoline, diesel andfuel oil by 25 percent until Dec. 31 in an effort to stabilizedomestic consumer prices, he said.
The United States has not joined the Kyoto Protocol to cutgreenhouse gases, but the pact nevertheless is boosting sales forAmerican companies that market ``clean'' energy technologies.The spread of renewable-energy standards -- particularly in Europe-- propelled by the treaty, along with a surge in oil and gas prices,havetriggered a boom in business for solar and wind energy companies.When Solar Integrated Technologies Inc. opened an office in Germanylast spring, for example, the salespeople were allocated enough solarroofing material to provide one megawatt of power. In six weeks, theywere sold out. Within a month, they had orders for 16 megawatts more.``It's a no-brainer to do business in solar in Europe,'' said JonSlangerup, chief executive of Solar Integrated, whose 120 employeesare producing about one mile of solar roofing panels a week at a plantin South Los Angeles. ``The only question is: How much can youallocate and how fast can you install it?''In Germany, the world's leading solar energy market, farmers arereplacing crops with fields of solar panels, thanks to a governmentbuyback program for renewable energy that spurred 150 percent growthin solar installations in 2004.Britain, France and Spain also have introduced aggressive plans toreduce their production of carbon dioxide and other heat-trappinggases over the next decade.``Every available (solar) module is going to Germany,'' said RhoneResch, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association inWashington, D.C. ``It's Google-like growth.''A world leader in renewable energy less than a decade ago, theUnited States is now viewed as a laggard. At the United NationsClimate Change Conference in Montreal this month, Canadian PrimeMinister Paul Martin accused the U.S. of lacking a ``globalconscience'' for refusing to sign the Kyoto treaty, which requiresdeveloped countries to slash their greenhouse gas emissions below 1990levels by 2012.Craig Stevens, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Energy, saidthe Bush administration recognized that climate change was a ``seriouslong-term issue.''But he said the best way to address that concern was by developingcleaner, more environmentally friendly forms of fossil-fuel-generatedenergy and nuclear power.Stevens said renewable energy would be an ``important part'' of thenation's energy mix, which was why the government was planning toinvest $391 million next year in solar, wind, hydroelectric andgeothermal energy projects.State and local governments don't think the Bush administration ismoving fast enough. Twenty states have established standards toguarantee that a certain portion of the energy they use comes fromrenewable-energy sources.California is already the world's third-largest market for solarenergy and the nation's leading producer of wind-generated power.The state agreed earlier this month to spend an additional $300million in subsidies to put solar energy panels on as many as 1million rooftops over the next 11 years.``California clearly has been a U.S. leader,'' said Ron Pernick,co-founder of Clean Edge Inc., a West Coast energy consulting companythat predicts that the market for solar photovoltaics, wind power andfuel cells will reach $15 billion a year by 2014.Unless domestic production expands quickly, Californians hoping tojump aboard the solar bandwagon could face lengthy delays, accordingto solar experts. They said the strong demand from Europe had taken upmuch of the U.S. production.Investors are scrambling to get a piece of the renewable-energyaction, sending the stocks of California companies such as SolarIntegrated and Clipper Windpower Inc. . Both companies are listed onthe London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market, whereinvestors have shown a strong appetite for ``green'' companies.Slangerup, who had just returned from a European investment tour,said governments in Europe were betting that having a strongrenewable-energy base would be a competitive advantage in the future.(Begin optional trim)Solar Integrated produces a commercial roofing material that usesphotovoltaic cells to produce about four watts of electricity persquare foot. Although it costs more to produce a kilowatt ofelectricity with this method, companies can use government subsidiesto offset their capital outlays. Those include a 30 percent federaltax credit on the cost of installation, rebates from the state andrenewable-energy credits that can be used to offset fees or fines.``You turn a roof into a performing asset that has a guaranteedenergy stream over 20 years,'' said Slangerup, whose customers includeCoca-Cola Co., PepsiCo Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and commercial realestate developer ProLogis. ``It becomes a real powerful sellingproposition.''He predicted that the cost of solar systems would drop bytwo-thirds over the next five years, thanks to technical improvements.(End optional trim)Rising natural gas prices have made wind technology anotherincreasingly attractive option. This year, wind power companies areexpected to spend close to $3 billion installing 2,500 megawatts ofnew capacity in the U.S., a 40 percent increase over the previousyear, according to Patrick Caramante, vice president of U.S.operations for British-based Garrad Hassan, one of the world's leadingwind energy research companies.Jim Dehlsen, founder of Clipper Technology, said, ``The U.S. markethas come to life,'' now that wind turbines can produce a kilowatt ofelectricity for 4.5 to 5 cents, compared with 9 to 9.5 cents for a newnatural gas turbine project.(Begin optional trim)Dehlsen's first entrepreneurial venture was Zond Corp., which wassold to Enron Corp. in 1997 and eventually ended up in the hands ofGeneral Electric Co. G.E. Energy is now the country's leading windpower provider.Clipper Technology recently opened an assembly plant in CedarRapids, Iowa, where Dehlsen expects to produce five of his high-powerLiberty wind turbines this year and 150 in 2006. Those turbines, whichare designed to operate even when wind is low, cost about $2.5 millioneach and can generate enough electricity over a 30-year life span topower 1,250 homes.(End optional trim)Some people complain about the visual blight and noise created bywind turbines. But Dehlsen said wind power generation was far lessdamaging to the environment than fossil fuels, which produce highlevels of greenhouse gases.In addition, wind power could bring jobs to depressed farming andindustrial areas. Dehlsen said. Germany, in less than six years, hasinstalled enough wind projects to generate 14,000 megawatts of powerand employ 75,000 people.``The U.S. has a huge wind energy resource,'' he said. ``There arefour states alone ... that could supply all of the electricity needsof the country.''Although most of his sales have been in the U.S., Dehlsen sees hugeopportunities in Europe and the developing world. He said he wasnegotiating deals in Eastern Europe, Latin America and China, with aneye on capturing 12 percent to 15 percent of the global market.But Dehlsen and other renewable-energy advocates said the lack ofgovernment support was threatening U.S. technological leadership,pointing to reduced support for the National Renewable Energy Lab inGolden, Colo., the primary provider of government research funds.Stepped-up interest from venture capitalists and Wall Streetinvestors has provided seed money for entrepreneurs in the U.S. Butonce they have mastered the technology, many companies are shiftingtheir manufacturing to countries where governments are providinginvestment incentives and an assurance of long-term demand.The U.S. share of global production of photovoltaic cells hasdropped from 45 percent in 1996 to 8 percent today, according to theSolar Energy Industries Association.Evergreen Solar Inc., one of the nation's leading solar companies,developed its modules at a facility in Marlboro, Mass., where itemploys 250 people. But the company sells three-quarters of itsproduct in Germany and plans to invest more than $50 million in aproduction plant there that will employ 400 people.``We will eventually build a plant here in the U.S.,'' said TimWoodward, a board member of Evergreen and managing director of NthPower, a San Francisco-based venture capital company. ``But the marketdemand is not great enough here for us to justify really expandingaggressively in the U.S. market.''
If solar power is going to become commonplacein the United States, more people like Aaron Dyer aregoing to have to buy it.Dyer, 34, is a firefighter in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. He hasa truck and a motorcycle. He's a big-time snowmobiler. He'san average guy.The only thing unusual with Dyer is that he has installed32 solar panels on the roof of his garage. Theygenerate about 500 kilowatt hours of electricity a month forhis newly built home here. He turned on the systemSept. 16. It generates enough electricity to supply 90 percentto 100 percent of his electricity needs, saving him roughly$60 a month.""I couldn't wait to turn it on,"" Dyer said. ""It waspretty awesome really. It still is.""Dyer has had an interest in solar energy for years. Sowhen he started planning to build his house a fewyears ago, he contacted Renewable Power Systems LLC, an AverillPark, N.Y,, company that sells solar electricity -- or photovoltaic-- systems.Dyer worked with Renewable Power to make sure he oriented hisgarage so that the solar panels would have southern exposurefor maximum electrical production. They also helped him design thesystem so that he would be eligible for grants andtax breaks through New York State's photovoltaic incentive program.Dyer paid $20,000 for the system using a home equity loan.But he estimates that the money he paid was lessthan half of the true cost of the system becausehe qualified for a financial assistance program through the NewYork State Energy Research and Development Authority.The program pays $4 per watt of a system, as longas it is tied to the state electricity grid. Healso is eligible for up to $3,750 in state taxcredits over five years that the state gives to peoplewho buy solar power generation equipment.Dyer is part of a new breed of solar energy user.Many of the initial adopters of the technology are peoplein their 50s and 60s who lived through the 1970soil crisis.But Michael Stangl, co-owner of Renewable Power, said Dyer is partof a new generation that is not only interested inconservation but is also extremely savvy when it comes totheir finances and combating rising energy costs.""Somehow they picked up on the fact that energy is animportant issue in our lives,"" Stangl said. ""He's kind oflike the second generation.""Stangl's company is benefiting from solar energy becoming more popular withpeople like Dyer. Renewable Power has sold 15 large residentialsolar power systems this year costing between $25,000 and $50,000,and it hopes to be selling two per month bythe end of the year.But the market has a lot more potential. Dyer still representsa small group of Americans who are getting their electricityfrom solar power. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration,of the 3.9 million gigawatt hours of electricity generated inthe United States last year, only 597 gigawatt hours camefrom solar power. Most electricity in the U.S. is generatedby the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil andnatural gas.The key to adding more solar power to the mix ismaking the technology cheaper, said Pradeep Haldar, director of theState University of New York at Albany's Energy and EnvironmentalTechnology Applications Center, which is part of Albany NanoTech. Haldarsaid that solar energy systems cost between $8 and $10per watt, but it would be ""compelling"" if the pricecould go down to $3 or $4 per watt.""It's getting better and better,"" said Haldar. ""I think it's amatter of time.""The center, also known as E2TAC, is working with companies likeDayStar Technologies Inc on the next generation of solar paneltechnologies that could be cheaper than the current silicon technology.One of the reasons that new technologies are needed is becauseof a silicon shortage that is driving up prices. Accordingto Paul Maycock, a nationally-recognized solar energy expert in Warrenton,Va., demand for silicon by the semiconductor industry and explosivegrowth of the solar industry, have caused silicon prices todouble for the solar cell industry to more than $40a kilogram.Some consumers are moving to solar gradually. Oleg Ivanov of Grafton,N.Y., said he plans to spend a small amount --up to $5,000 -- for a solar energy system thatwill store energy in batteries. The 34-year-old information technology auditconsultant has been testing how the system works with smallsolar panels he bought that are designed to charge boatand car batteries. He envisions a system that would providebetween 300 and 500 watts of energy to supplement theelectricity he buys from his utility.""This way I can use less from the grid,"" he said.Builders may hold another key to developing the solar energy market.Michael Eidens, a former Schenectady, N.Y., judge who is nowrunning for county legislator, is building a 3,000-square-foot house. Theconstruction firm he hired, Stewart Construction Inc., worked closely withRenewable Power, which installed a 3.34 kilowatt solar system onthe home's roof. Stewart Construction is building the home asan Energy Star home, a designation New York gives tohomes that meet certain energy efficiency criteria.""To make a big impact, you've got to work with builders,""said Stangl, of Renewable Power. ""At the moment, we don'thave a lot of builders doing it.""Philip LaRocque, executive vice president of the New York State BuildersAssociation, said his group is extremely supportive of building energy-efficienthomes and the Energy Star program. He said builders aremore than happy to incorporate solar panels in homes ifcustomers want it.""We do live and breathe it,"" he said.
The Chinese government will raise about 180 billion US dollars to develop renewable energy from now to 2020, said a senior official at the Beijing International Renewable Energy Conference that opened  here MondayBy then, the share of renewable energy in primary energy consumption will stand at 15 percent, rising from the current seven percent, said Zhang Guobao, vice minister of the National Development and Reform Commission.Renewable energy, including solar, wind power, and hydropower, will contribute to better energy security in China, said Zhang. Italso delivers substantial economic and environmental results, alleviating poverty.In the coming 15 years, China will actively develop biomass liquid fuel with crops, said Zhang, to reach the capacity of replacing ten million tons of petroleum each year.China also plans to expand the heat collection area of solar heater to 300 million cubic meters by 2020, replacing about 40 million tons of standard coal annually.
The Indonesian government is planning to build thousands of small scale solar power units and microhydro plants on its eastern islands next year to boost power capacity in remote areas.The government will build 15,000 household solar power units, each with a capacity of 100 watts, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources' Director General of Electricity and Energy YogoPratomo was quoted Tuesday by The Jakarta Post as saying.""We hope the (small-scale) power units will meet electricity demand in remote areas in eastern Indonesia,"" he said.Each of the solar cell units will cost between 5 million rupiah(500 US dollars) and 6 million rupiah in construction.""However, they won't use any fuel except sunlight so there is no extra expense,"" said Yogo.Aside from utilizing sunlight, the government also plans to build 200 microhydro power plants with a capacity of between 50 kilowatts (kW) and 500 kW each. Investment needed for every kW is estimated at 20 million rupiah (2,000 dollars).The development of power capacity in the country has been hampered due to a lack of funds since the monetary crisis severelyhit the country in 1997, despite the steadily rising demand.State-run electricity company PLN is focusing its expansion on Java -- where more than half of the country's population live and an estimated 70 percent of the country's economic activity is located -- Bali and Sumatra. The company has allocated just 17 percent of its projects for other islands.The latest data from the World Bank shows that the electrification ratio in Java reaches 72 percent, while that in Maluku is limited to 50 percent. Only one in five people enjoys the luxury of electricity in natural resource-rich Papua, Indonesia's least-developed province.Despite massive potential, power plants using renewable energy sources contribute only a small portion of the country's total installed power capacity of about 25,000 megawatts (MW).The installed capacity of mini and micro hydropower plants is only 54 MW, while those utilizing geothermal and biomass energy have installed capacity of 800 MW and 302 MW, respectively.The government aims to raise the use of new and renewable energy sources in power generation from 0.2 percent currently to 4percent by 2020.
Italy will help Beijing build a solar energy system for the city's Olympic Village, supplying hot water and electricity for the Games in 2008 and beyond.Corrado Clini, a top official from the Italian Ministry for theEnvironment, said Italy will invest a total of 4 million euros (4.7 million US dollars) in the project, according to Monday's China Daily.The solar energy system will be jointly constructed by the Guoao Investment and Development Co. Ltd of China, and Italy's Merloni TermoSanitari International Trading Co. Ltd.The project will supply hot water and electricity to 16,000 people during the Games. After the event, the system will supply 2,000 apartments, housing around 6,000 people, the China Daily reported.The project is one of the co-operative projects included in a Memorandum of Understanding on Environmental Co-operation signed between the Italian ministry and Beijing's municipal government in2002.It will ""help Beijing fulfill its commitment to the Green Olympics,"" said Pei Chenghu, vice-director of Beijing's Environmental Protection Bureau.However, solar energy will not be the only energy source for the Olympic Village, and other energy supply systems are prepared,Clini said.Since 2002, Italy has invested nearly 40 million euros (47 million US dollars) in helping Beijing improve its environment in 17 projects, the newspaper said.
World Energy Giant BP group announced Thursday that its subsidiary BP Solar has signed a contract with a local company to form a joint venture to develop solar photovoltaic in China.The joint venture, jointly established with China Xinjiang SunOasis Co., will see the creation of two companies, BP SunOasis Company Limited and BP SunOasis (Prime) Company Limited, which together will manufacture, market and sell solar photovoltaic (PV)products and systems in China.Based in Xi'an, capital of West China's Shaanxi Province, the joint venture will enjoy a 25-megawatt manufacturing capacity. It has a total registered capital of over 10 million US dollars and the equity percentage split between SunOasis and BP Solar is 51 to49, according to BP.The joint venture represents an excellent opportunity for BP Solar to position itself and grow in the growing solar PV market by expanding its manufacturing network.China is planning for its domestic solar PV market to reach up to 400MW by 2010 and 10,000 MW by 2020 from a 2005 base of 20MW.According to BP, the joint venture will focus on providing access to sustainable power in remote rural areas throughout China,as well as the developing grid-connect market.Lee Edwards, CEO of BP Solar, said that it is a great strategicopportunity for SunOasis and BP Solar, both of which share a common vision for the long-term solar potential in China.The joint venture will add to BP Solar's already strong presence in the Asia-Pacific region, he said.As one of the world's largest oil, gas and petrochemical companies, BP has been operating in China since the early 1970s and has invested over three billion US dollars in the country's commercial projects.So far, BP's activities in China include the production and importation of natural gas, supply of aviation fuel, import and marketing of LPG, fuels retailing, lubricants blending and sales, petrochemical manufacturing and solar electric facilities.Xinjiang SunOasis Co., Ltd (SunOasis), founded in 2000, is a private limited company located in northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Its largest shareholder, Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock Co., Ltd (TBEA) is a public listed company in China and one of the top largest transformer manufacturers in the world.SunOasis is the leading solar system integrator in China with approximately 25 to 30 percent share of the Chinese market.
The Angolan government has unveiledan ambitious scheme to supply solar energy to rural populations over the coming 15 years.Launching the project in Luanda Friday, Deputy Energy Minister Rui Tito said studies indicate that Angola has sufficient potential for a nationwide rural electrification program using solar power.Under the 220 million US dollars renewal energy scheme, 1,300 villages across the country will be equipped with 15 solar generating plants each.""The project aims to guarantee access to energy, giving better quality of life to people in remoter parts of the country,"" said Tito.
","Germany is the world's leading solar energy market. Farmers are replacing crops with fields of solar energy panels, thanks to government incentives, which have spurred 150 percent growth in one year. A world leader in renewal energy a decade ago, the U.S. is lagging. For lack of government support, its share of photovoltaic cell production has dropped from 45 percent in 1996 to 8 percent in 2005. The U.S. may gain ground by use of technology. One producer predicts that, thanks to technical improvement, the cost of solar systems will drop by two-thirds over the next five years. ","Italy helped Beijing build a solar energy system for the Olympic Games in 2008 and beyond. China plans to spend $180 billion on renewable energy, including substantial solar heat development. Indonesia plans to build thousands of small solar power units to boost power capacity. Taiwan's renewable energy promotion has yielded the world's third highest installation density of solar water heaters. Angola developed a plan to supply energy to its rural population. The plan would provide 1300 villages with 15 solar generating plants each. ","Portugal now has an operating license for the world's largest solar power station. Indonesia plans thousands of small-scale solar plants to assist remote areas and Angola has a similar 15-year plan. Italy will help China in building a solar system for hot water for the Olympic Games. China also has a contract with BP Group to develop solar photovoltaic. Germany is the world's leading solar energy market. California, the third largest market and will increase subsidies for possibly a million rooftop solar panels over the next eleven years. Greece's president and prime minister have solar panels on official residences. ","Although California has the world's 3rd largest market for solar materials, the US is moving slowly toward solar power. Last year, .00067% of its electric power came from solar. Germany has the largest world market. China, building a solar powered Olympic village, is planning to expand collection areas to 300 million cubic meters by 2020 and have the photovoltaic market grow from 20 megawatt hours to 10,000 by 2020. Taiwan is proud of having the worlds 3rd highest density of solar water heaters and has a ""solar-powered city"" project underway. Angola plans to provide solar power plants to 1,300 villages. "
D0904,D0904-A,"Rioting erupted Saturday in an impoverished neighborhood of Toledo, Ohio after hundreds of counter-protestors broke up a planned march by a neo-Nazi group, Toledo police confirmed.Scores of rioters rampaged through streets wrecking cars and setting a building on fire in north Toledo after police fired tear gas on the anti-Nazi group.Six people were arrested, according to Fox News.The violence broke out after a group of nearly 80 white supremacists of the Virigina-based National Socialist Movement assembled for a march against what they called black gang violence against whites in the Toledo neighborhood.Bob White, leader of the movement, said police forced his group to disband after the protestors gathered around them and began to throw stones.""The police lost total control of the situation,"" he told AFP.""We were protesting black racial violence against white people in that neighborhood,"" said White.But a local politician said that the multi-ethnic neighborhood was not particularly beset by violence.""That neighborhood has never been known for racial tensions,"" city councilman Robert McCloskey told Fox.
White supremacists clashed with an angry crowd outside Faneuil Hall, whereHolocaust survivors and their families were commemorating the liberation of Naziconcentration camps.Two people were arrested during Sunday's confrontation, officer John Boyle said.Sunday was the 60th anniversary of the end of the Allied victory over NaziGermany.Inside the historic meeting house, Holocaust survivors, their children andgrandchildren lit white candles to commemorate the estimated 6 million Jewskilled by the Nazis. Germany's consul-general to New England, Wolfgang Vorwerk,spoke of his country's role.Outside, 10 to 15 members of the Arkansas-based group White Revolution wereescorted by officers to a designated protest area across the street. Theofficers, many in riot gear, formed a barricade between the protesters and about100 people who angrily shouted at them to leave Boston.Two people were charged with disturbing the peace after a scuffle outside theprotest area. Police said Shireen Chambers, 36, of Boston, who is white, strucka black man, Jerome Higins, 25, of Everett, and he retaliated by spitting in herface and hitting her with a sign. Boyle said at least one officer was injuredwhile arresting Chambers, who yelled racist epithets as she was draggedaway.Gov. Mitt Romney, who attended the Faneuil Hall event, said he was disgusted bythe presence of the supremacists.""Today of all days, to have white supremacists come here from Arkansas, is mostdisappointing,"" he said. ""I wish they'd go back home where the came from andbury themselves under the rocks that they crawled out from.""
A city council candidate dropped out of the race Friday after it was disclosedthat he posted comments to a white supremacist Internet bulletin board more than4,000 times.Doug Hanks said the postings were fictional and designed to win whitesupremacists' trust as he researched a novel he was writing. He said the bookwas also meant to appeal to white supremacists.""I needed information for the book and some other writings I was doing,"" Hankstold The Associated Press on Friday. ""I did what I thought I needed to do toestablish myself as a credible white nationalist.""Hanks had filed papers seeking the Republican nomination for one of fourat-large council seats, but formally withdrew Friday, said county electionsdirector Michael Dickerson.Hanks' postings over the past three years were first reported by The RhinocerosTimes, a weekly newspaper. In one June 1 posting, he said blacks should betreated like ""rabid beasts.""Hanks said his self-published novel, called ""Patriot Act,"" takes themes from""The Turner Diaries"" _ the racist novel believed to have inspired Oklahoma Citybomber Timothy McVeigh.""I saw how successful these 'Turner Diaries' had been and that was the path totake,"" he told the AP. White supremacists, he said, ""have more of a tendency toword of mouth, to say, 'Hey, you ought to pick this up.'""Republican Mayor Pat McCrory condemned Hanks.""He's a man of total inner hatred in both his heart and soul, and it doesn'tmatter what party he's in,"" McCrory said.
A white Republican lawmaker who contends he was excluded from a Blacklegislative group solely because of his race said Tuesday that the group is evenmore racist than the Ku Klux Klan.""My understanding is that the KKK doesn't even ban members by race,"" Rep. StaceyCampfield, a lawmaker from Knoxville, told The Associated Press, adding that theKKK ""has less racist bylaws"" than the black lawmakers' group.Earlier this year, Campfield was promptly rebuffed when he inquired aboutjoining the Black Caucus. He had earlier said he wanted to join the group tofind out how it spends its money.There are 18 black state lawmakers in Tennessee and Campfield's request wasdeemed to have been made from a ""strange guy"" who was simply interested instirring up trouble.""I definitely think they should allow white people in as members,"" Campfieldsaid. ""If we work together we might be able to pull things off and get thingsdone.""Tennessee Black Caucus member Rep. Larry Miller, a Democrat, said no whitelawmaker has ever asked to join. He acknowledged the group's bylaws mention onlyblack lawmakers but said it might consider admitting a white lawmaker _ notnecessarily Campfield who is ""using this as a joke.""Campfield posted a message on his Web journal, or blog, last week about hisunsuccessful attempt to join the black lawmakers' group.On Saturday, under the heading ""I too dream,"" Campfield posted long excerptsfrom the Rev. Martin Luther King's famous 1963 ""I Have a Dream"" speech in whichKing dreams of a day when his children ""will not be judged by the color of theirskin but by the content of their character.""This use of King's speech infuriated some readers, and Campfield announcedMonday that he was banning reader comments on his blog after some of thepostings included death threats.""People just started going crazy about it,"" Campfield said.Experts on race and hate groups said Campfield hit a nerve when he used King'swords to take on a black institution. It's the same tactic white separatistsoften use, said Mark Potok, director of the Intelligence Project at the SouthernPoverty Law Center.""Very typically these days we see white supremacists, hate groups, trying to usethe words of King and other civil rights leaders to try to advance theiragendas,"" Potok said.On his blog, 37-year-old Campfield has also derided gay adoption andabortion.Although Campfield said he still believes the blog is a good idea, it will nowcarry only his posts, along with a little biographical information _ such as hisinterests in judo and karate, and a listing of the Bible as his favoritebook.___On the Net:
A crowd protesting a white supremacists' march turned violent, throwingbaseball-sized rocks at police, vandalizing vehicles and stores, and settingfire to a neighborhood bar, authorities said.When Mayor Jack Ford and a local minister tried to calm the rioting Saturday,they were cursed for allowing the march, and Ford said a masked gang memberthreatened to shoot him.At least 65 people were arrested and several police officers were injured beforecalm was restored about four hours later.Ford blamed the rioting on gangs taking advantage of a volatile situation. Hedeclared a state of emergency, set an 8 p.m. (0000 GMT) curfew through theweekend, and asked the Highway Patrol for help.""It's exactly what they wanted,"" Ford said of the group that planned the march,which was canceled because of the rioting.At least two dozen members of the National Socialist Movement, which callsitself ""America's Nazi Party,"" had gathered at a city park to march under policeprotection. Organizers said they were demonstrating against black gangs theysaid were harassing white residents.The violence broke out about one-quarter of a mile away along the planned marchroute shortly before it was to begin. One group of men pounded on a conveniencestore, and others overturned vehicles. There was a report of a shooting butpolice hadn't found a victim, Police Chief Mike Navarre said.About 150 police officers chased bands of young men through the area. Officerswearing gas masks fired tear gas canisters and flash-bang devices designed tostun suspects, but the groups continued throwing rocks and bottles. Severalofficers and firefighters suffered minor injuries, Navarre said. At one point,the crowd reached 600 people, officials said.Finally, police marched shoulder-to-shoulder down the street shouting to peopleto stay inside, and the crowd of several hundred broke up.At least 65 people were arrested on charges including assault, vandalism,failure to obey police and failure to disperse, Navarre said. He said the whitesupremacists had left hours earlier.""We frankly could have made a couple hundred arrests easily,"" Navarre said. ""Wejust didn't have the resources on hand to arrest all of them.""The mayor had appealed to residents the night before to ignore the march. Hesaid the city wouldn't give the Nazi group a permit to march in the streets butcouldn't stop them from walking on the sidewalks.When the rioting began, Ford tried to negotiate with those involved, but ""theyweren't interested in that."" He said people in the crowd swore at him and wantedto know why he was protecting the Nazis.They were mostly ""gang members who had real or imagined grievances and took itas an opportunity to speak in their own way,"" Ford said.""I was chagrined that there were obvious mothers and children in the crowd withthem,"" he said.Thomas Frisch, 76, said a large group of men destroyed the exterior of a gasstation next to his home of 30 years.""A whole big gang started to come in here. Next thing you know, they're jumpingon the car. Then they overturned it. Then they started on the building, breakingwindows, ripping the bars off,"" he said.Louis Ratajski, 86, and his nephew, Terry Rybczynski, left Jim & Lou's Baras a crowd gathered in front pelting police with rocks and breaking the windows.They climbed down a fire escape from the apartment where Ratajski lived over thebar and only later saw the fire on television.""I was shaking. I feared for my life."" Rybczynski said.Keith White, a black resident, criticized city officials for allowing the marchin the first place.""They let them come here and expect this not to happen?"" said White,29.A spokesman for the National Socialist Movement blamed police for losing controlof the situation.
In the days leading up to a white supremacist march, ministers pleaded withresidents in the predominantly black neighborhood to stay calm and communityleaders organized peace rallies.Authorities even delayed releasing the route so protesters wouldn't know wherethe group planned to march.It wasn't enough to stop an angry mob that included gang members from lootingand burning a neighborhood bar, smashing the windows of a gas station andhurling rocks and bottles at police on Saturday. Twelve officers were injured,one suffering a concussion when a brick flew through her cruiserwindow.In all, 114 people were arrested on charges including assault, vandalism,failure to disperse and overnight curfew violations.""We knew during the preparation that it was going to be a tremendous challenge,""Police Chief Mike Navarre said Sunday. ""Anyone who would accuse us of beingunderprepared I would take exception with that.""Much of the anger boiled over because people were upset that city leaders werewilling to allow the supremacists to walk through the neighborhood and shoutinsults, residents and authorities said.""You can't allow people to come challenge a whole city and not think theyweren't going to strike back,"" said Kenneth Allen, 47, who watched the violencebegin near his home.Authorities said there was little they could do to stop the group, because theydid not apply for a parade permit and instead planned to walk alongsidewalks.""They do have a right to walk on the Toledo sidewalks,"" said Mayor Jack Ford,who at one point confronted leaders of the mob and tried to settle themdown.A gang member in a mask threatened to shoot him, and others cursed him forallowing the march, the mayor said. He said he didn't know if the man whothreatened him was actually armed, but he blamed gangs for much of the violence.The march had been called off because of the crowds, and the white supremacistshad left.If the Nazi group tries to come back, Ford said he would seek a court order tostop them.Navarre said the riots escalated because members of the National SocialistMovement took their protest to the neighborhood, which is predominantly black,instead of a neutral place. ""If this march had occurred in downtown Toledo, wewouldn't have had the unrest,"" he said.The neighborhood northwest of downtown, full of tree-lined streets and well-keptbrick homes, once was a thriving Polish community. But within the last decadeit's become home to poorer residents.The neo-Nazi group, known as ""America's Nazi Party,"" said they came to the citybecause of a dispute between neighbors, one white and the otherblack.Police began receiving word midweek from officers on the street that gangs weregoing to descend on the neighborhood in protest, the police chief said. Thedisturbances were confined to a 1-square-mile (2.6-square-kilometer) area, butthe crowd swelled to about 600 people, overwhelming police.The crowds were eventually dispersed by police in riot gear after about fourhours, and the mayor declared a state of emergency that remained in effectthrough the weekend.About 200 officers patrolled the neighborhood overnight after the riot, Navarresaid. Police reported no problems Sunday, but an 8 p.m. curfew was in effect fora second night.Neighbors were divided about the city allowing the march.""They don't have the right to bring hate to my front yard,"" said TerranceAnderson, who lives near a bar that was destroyed.Other neighbors said the group had a right to have their say. ""Too bad thepeople couldn't ignore them,"" said Dee Huntley.
``You could abort every black baby in this country, and the crimerate would go down.''-- William Bennett, radio talk show host and former U.S. educationsecretaryWASHINGTON -- A protest demonstration is scheduled for Wednesday atthe Salem Radio Network in Arlington, Va., where William Bennettworks. And a boycott of the sponsors of his show is being organized.In drumming up support for these actions, one e-mailer called Bennetta racist and eugenicist and declared, ``That's how Hitler gotstarted.''There is a problem here. But it's not Bennett, whose commentsilluminated a moral inconsistency in black America that is far moreharmful than anything he said. Forget about Bennett's absurd crimecure -- a proposal he acknowledged would be morally wrong -- and justlook at the most recent analysis of abortion data, released in July bythe Alan Guttmacher Institute.African-American women, who make up only 13 percent of the U.S.female population, accounted for 32 percent of the 1,293,000 abortionsperformed in the United States in 2002.That's 413,760 abortions performed on black women in one year -- or1,133 a day. (In Washington, half of all pregnancies ended inabortion, a higher percentage than in any state.) No outcry over thatbecause those were just disposable fetuses, right?That is, until Bennett spoke of aborting ``black babies,'' andsuddenly those fetuses become precious pre-born black people who mustbe saved from the evil Dr. Bill.It's just a different twist to the same old story. If the Ku KluxKlan were killing blacks the way blacks kill blacks, we'd be up inarms. If whites in blackface were filling the airways with degradinglyrics and minstrel shows, we'd at least shoot the TV and radio. Butas along as it's just us acting a fool, who cares?This is the consequence of our corrosive moral inconsistency: adependence on the opposition of whites to give meaning and value toblack life.Robert Woodson Sr., president of the National Center forNeighborhood Enterprise, puts it bluntly. ``There are black people whoshare the beliefs of white supremacists and who, by their actions,concede that white people hold the keys to everything we are and canbecome,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``The feeling is, 'Unlessthey change, we can't change.' ''As I've noted before, even our immune system is compromised by thestress of such a frenzied, mothlike attraction to white slights. Worstof all, we know better and still can't seem to stop ourselves.``Our health is our responsibility,'' said Jackson L. Davis III, aurologist and coordinator of men's health initiatives at the D.C.Department of Health. He spoke at a recent health conference for blackmen at Howard University. And he meant all aspects of our health:mental, physical, emotional and spiritual.``At health fairs, when I ask our young people what are their tophealth concerns, they say, 'To go to school or a party and not getshot,' '' Davis said.No one at the conference jumped up to blame the white man.Atiba Coppock, an educational psychologist based in the District,called on black men to assume their responsibilities as husbands andfathers and suggested new ways to build character in our black boys.``Traditional African education focused on integrity, and we need torefocus on that,'' Coppock said. ``The goal was to build a person whowas going to be godlike; in other words, your whole focus is to be thebest person you can be spiritually, and that impacts those around youand the community in which you live.''Jules P. Harrell, a professor and acting chairman of Howard'sDepartment of Psychology, said African-Americans need to ``cultivate anew sense of body,'' one rooted in health and self-respect and not inpopular culture, such as rap music videos.To that end, we might welcome the controversy about abortion andblack babies and the long-overdue focus it brings to the black womb --home to hope unbound as well as unspeakable tragedy. Who isresponsible for the protection and care of this amazing uterineenvironment, where the most wonderful fetal programming can occur justby having a loving husband kiss his pregnant wife?Bennett? Sorry, he ain't in it.
For Joan Humphrey Lefkow, the nightmare began shortly afterher 2000 appointment as a federal judge, when an Oregongroup's lawsuit to block white supremacists from using a nameit had trademarked, World Church of the Creator, landed inher lap.Soon, Lefkow found her home address and family photographs posted alongwith violent threats on hate-filled Websites, and last April, oneof the Aryan movement's most notorious leaders was convicted ofplotting her murder.On Tuesday, Lefkow sat sequestered under armed federal guard in anundisclosed location, mourning her husband of 30 years and her89-year-old mother, whom she found dead of gunshots to thehead in their basement the day before, sending her screaminginto the quiet street.""I think she's very upset with herself, maybe, for being ajudge and putting her family in this danger,"" said LauraLefkow, 20, the third of the judge's five daughters, ""butthere's no way she should have known.""Local and federal law enforcement officials said on Tuesday that theywere investigating possible connections between the double murder and MatthewHale, the white supremacist currently in federal prison for solicitingLefkow's assassination, or his many sympathizers. Federal officials in Washingtonsaid agents were scrubbing Lefkow's entire caseload in search ofsuspects, with the main thrust on the hate groups thathad targeted her before.Already, some white supremacists were celebrating the killings on the Internet,while others spun conspiracy theories that the crime was committedby Hale's enemies to poison the atmosphere before his sentencingnext month. Experts who have spent years tracking Hale's organization-- now called Creativity -- also pointed to the upcomingsentencing, noting that one of his acolytes, Benjamin Smith, wenton a shooting spree in 1999 after Hale was rejectedby the Illinois bar.""We saw what happened the last time Matt Hale got slappedin the face by the system: The price of thatwas two dead and nine severely wounded,"" said Mark Potok,director of intelligence for the Southern Poverty Law Center. ""NowMatt Hale is about to be sentenced, very probably, tomost of his natural life to federal prison. It's verypossible that a Hale follower or sympathizer has decided tofight back.""(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)Billy Roper, a friend of Hale's who is chairman of agroup called White Revolution, disavowed the violence but offered adifferent parallel: the FBI's 1992 confrontation in Ruby Ridge, Idaho,with the white separatist Randall C. Weaver, whose wife and14-year-old son wound up dead.""We can stand alongside the federal law enforcement community in sayingjust as they felt a deep regret and sadness overthe death of Randy Weaver's family so we also feela deep sense of regret and sadness over the deathof Judge Lefkow's family,"" Roper said. ""If it was thecase that someone was misguided and thought that they werehelping Matt Hale, then it would be similar in thatother people had suffered for one person's mistake.""Hale, who is representing himself, faces up to 40 years inprison, and has been held for two years in theMetropolitan Correctional Center here under special administrative measures, reserved forterrorists, that limited contact with the outside world.Federal officials refused to discuss the restrictions, but his mother, EvelynHutcheson, said that she and his father are the onlypeople he is allowed contact with, and that they arelimited to 15-minute phone calls each Thursday morning, and separatehourlong visits twice a month.""He had nothing to do with what went on last night,""Hutcheson said in a telephone interview from her home inEast Peoria, Ill.

""Somebody has done this to make himget an enhanced sentence.""The authorities cautioned that it is too soon to focus onany one theory of the crime, though they did notoffer other possible scenarios or motives. Casings from .22-caliber bulletswere found at the scene, and the medical examiner citedthe cause of death as multiple gunshot wounds.James Molloy, the Chicago Police Department's chief of detectives, said themurders happened between 10:30 a.m., when Lefkow's mother answered atelephone call from one of her granddaughters, and 5:30 p.m.when the judge returned home. At 4 p.m., the Lefkows'youngest daughter, Margaret, 16, came home to get her gymbag and left without seeing anyone in the house, Molloysaid.""There is much speculation about possible links between this crime andthe possible involvement of hate groups,"" he said at anews conference. ""This is but one facet of our investigation.We are looking in many, many directions.""Hiram Grau, the department's deputy superintendent, said: ""The questions you haveare the same ones we have and we are workingaround the clock to get them answered.""Shannon Metzger, a spokesman for the U.S. Marshal's service, said thatLefkow had a special protective detail for ""a couple ofweeks"" last year, but it was disbanded when the threatsagainst her were deemed ""not viable.""

Lefkow, 64, anattorney who was a leader in the Episcopal church, andDonna Humphrey, 89, an ailing grandmother who hand-stitched quilts foreach of her 23 descendants.Michael Lefkow, who ran unsuccessfully for Cook County judge in 2002and 2004, argued two cases before the U.S. Supreme Courtand worked for the Legal Aid Society and the U.S.Postal Service before starting a solo firm about 20 yearsago. He spent every Sunday at St. Luke's in Evanston,flirting with the elderly women in the pews, and since1992 had been a lay member of the governing committeeof the Chicago Diocese of the Episcopal Church.A flamenco dancer and tennis player, Lefkow met his future wifein the library of Wheaton College, where she was anundergraduate. ""She was doing a paper on Indonesia and hewas doing a paper on Indonesia, and she had allhis books,"" Laura Lefkow recalled of her parents' first encounter.""Then he asked her out for a beer, and shesaid maybe coffee.""Lefkow said that her father, a former cab driver, bus driverand substitute teacher, sought out the local courthouse, post officeand Episcopal church wherever he went, because he saw themas the ""pillars of society.""""He used to say he was rich in daughters and notmuch else,"" she laughed. ""He was just an optimist abouteverything, to the point where it was like, 'Oh mygosh, dad, come on,' and he would be like, 'It'llbe fine,' and it was. It was always fine.""Laura's grandmother, Humphrey, who lived in a tan townhouse in Denver,had been staying with the judge's family since before Christmasas she recovered from a kidney infection. Neighbors in Denversaid she played Solitaire and Scrabble on a computer andfrequently cooked big meals for friends.Joan Lefkow, a magistrate judge since 1982, was appointed to theU.S. District Court by President Clinton, and originally ruled infavor of Hale, dismissing the trademark case, in 2002. Butafter an appeals court reversed her decision, Lefkow had littlechoice but to order Hale to remove the World Churchname from his Web sites and printed material or facefines of $1,000 per day.She was immediately vilified -- Hal Turner, an underground radio personality,said on his show that she was ""worthy of beingkilled,"" adding that ""it wouldn't be legal but in myopinion it wouldn't be wrong."" Hale, who called himself PontifexMaximus of the church that at one point claimed 30,000members, was arrested in January 2003, after an FBI informantinfiltrated the church to become his security chief.The informant, Anthony Evola, provided an e-mail message in which Halesought Lefkow's home address, and a tape recording of themdiscussing her fate. ""We gonna exterminate the rat?"" Evola asked.Hale said that he prefers to ""fight within the law""but ""if you wish to, ah, do anything yourself, youcan, you know?""

In a small industrial park west of Keller, Texas, near sprawlingneighborhoods and new schools, a storage facility routinely receives shipmentsof merchandise geared toward a certain clientele -- white supremacistsand anti-Semites.An FBI joint task force knows about the place and thepeople who operate it.So do the Tarrant County Sheriff's Department and a national watchdoggroup that monitors hate groups nationwide.Aryan Wear, an online clothing, music and book outlet that opposesJews and promotes white supremacy, keeps much of its merchandisein the storage stall near Fort Worth.Incorporated by Fort Worth man, Aryan Wear is one of 10hate and racially intolerant operations in Dallas-Fort Worth, according tothe Southern Poverty Law Center, which is based in Montgomery,Ala., and tracks extremist groups.While most such groups' members are open about their views, theoperators of Aryan Wear remain for the most part anonymous,letting their online sales pitches spread their message.""You don't really have my permission to use my name inyour article pertaining to this. I think this pretty muchseals the deal,"" said a phone message left at theFort Worth Star-Telegram by Tony Eynon, who is named asAryan Wear's president and lone director in corporate records filedwith the Texas secretary of state's office in Austin.A pilot who was until recently licensed to fly Boeing 737scommercially, Eynon, 30, declined to be interviewed, saying in hisphone message that he had recently sold Aryan Wear andthat ""there's just the finalization of paperwork right now.""He lives with his wife and young child in a well-establishedneighborhood -- down the street from a black family anda Hispanic family -- in a home no different fromany other on the block until, neighbors say, the garagedoor rises, revealing a large Confederate flag on the wall.Joe Roy, chief researcher for the law center's magazine, the IntelligenceReport, called Aryan Wear a ""hate-for-profit"" business, a kind ofone-stop shopping for the fashion needs of white supremacists.""The Web site's merchandise includes a T-shirt that declares, ""Deport Pedro,""another with a picture of Adolf Hitler and the inscription""I was right,"" and a third with a design similarto a Tide detergent logo but altered to say, ""Pride... For a Whiter, Brighter Future!""Aryan Wear's signature product, however, is a high-laced boot with swastikascarved in the sole, allowing its wearer to leave animpression of the Nazi symbol on soft ground.""An outstanding product real skinheads can be proud to be associatedwith,"" one wearer said in a review on the AryanWear Web site. The reviewed called the boots ""Too White...!""Roy said the boots were created by Eynon's friend Christopher Evans,who was connected with the violence-prone Confederate Hammerskins in Dallasand now lives in the Fort Worth area.Evans could not be reached for comment.Initially, Roy said, the boots were sold to make money forthe National Alliance. But the once-powerful neo-Nazi organization is nowin turmoil, with declining membership, since the death of itslongtime leader, William Pierce, in 2002.Roy said the boots were the alliance's biggest moneymaker until August2003 when Eynon formed Aryan Wear as a Texas companyand began selling the boots exclusively.A man identifying himself as Jim Reid, who lives near Austin,said in a recent telephone interview that Eynon is nolonger associated with Aryan Wear and that he is thenew president and chief executive officer.There are three ""primary"" owners, in Houston, Florida and New Jersey,and the new owners want to remain ""silent partners,"" Reidsaid.He denied that the business promotes hatred or that its products-- including the ""Happy Hitler Baby Doll"" T-shirt -- areoverly radical.""It doesn't have anything to do with hate,"" Reid said. ""Wewant to basically present a positive image to the youthand the public in general.""Local officials are not impressed.""I'm glad that authorities are aware of this operation and arekeeping an eye on it,"" said Roy Brooks, a leaderin the local African-American community and a member of theTarrant County Commissioners Court.""We can't legislate good taste or human compassion. I wish wecould,"" Brooks said.Lori Bailey, a spokeswoman for the FBI in North Texas, saidfederal authorities are ""keenly aware"" of Aryan Wear because ofits apparent association with the sometimes violent skinhead movement. Baileysaid, however, that the FBI can do little because thebusiness is not breaking the law.Tarrant County Sheriff Dee Anderson agreed that he saw nothing illegalin Aryan Wear's business tactics. Still, Anderson said, ""they areclearly tied to the white supremacist movement, if you lookat the types of merchandise they're offering. ...""I think anytime anybody deals in that type of activity, it'sa concern for law enforcement,"" Anderson said. ""It certainly bearswatching."" Fort Worth Star-Telegram researcher Cathy Belcher contributed to thisreport.

While the promise of this weekend's mass demonstrationshave a few jittery, area law enforcement and activists areplanning to defuse confrontations that could turn a verbal showdowninto a physical brawl.Hundreds of peace and pro-Bush demonstrators are expected to pack Crawfordand the areas near President Bush's ranch house over theweekend. However, the potential appearance of white supremacists and theplanned Sunday visit of activist and former presidential candidate Rev.Al Sharpton should help foster the media circus that hasbeen growing on the Texas prairie near the Western WhiteHouse.""Riots, like grass fire, start from the smallest little spark,"" saidBill Johnson, who owns the Yellow Rose, a prominent giftshop at Crawford's main intersection. ""We need to prevent thatspark.""Johnson, who is organizing pro-Bush rallies for Saturday, is among theevent organizers who realize the perfect storm-in-the-making. High temperatures, ratchetedrhetoric and crowds of people are sure to fuel tempers.While there are no official crowd estimates, representatives for both campsbelieve hundreds will mass in Crawford in support of thepresident or Cindy Sheehan, the peace mom at the centerof demonstrations.Sheehan has vowed to keep vigil near the president's vacation homeuntil he agrees to meet with her to discuss bringingan end to the Iraq war.Many sheriff's deputies have been alongside Sheehan since she began hervigil on Aug. 6.The McLennan County Sheriff's Office, which has taken the lead inproviding security and running interference, believes the weekend should bepeaceful, as has been the last three weeks. Chief DeputyRandy Plemons said they don't plan to change their standardgame plan, which has mostly worked.Sheriff's deputies have depended on some level of self-policing by holdingindividual leaders responsible for groups of people. Those leaders, inturn, keep others in check by keeping the anti-war andpro-Bush sides separated and discouraging verbal sparring. When that's notenough, lines of squad cars line up end-to-end to physicallyblock opposing demonstrators from one another.So far, only two people have been arrested in connection withdisturbances at the peace camp protest site.""I am more worried about the heat than I am aboutanyone else out there,"" Plemons said, referring to triple-digit temperatureson Saturday.On the Internet, a forum posting from the Stormfront White NationalistCommunity urged white supremacists to come to Crawford this weekendto speak out against the war. The posting claims thatthe Iraq war bolsters Israel. The group is not onlyracist, but is anti-Semitic.A Sheehan spokesman said the white supremacists were not invited byanyone connected with Cindy Sheehan. They would be asked toleave if they set foot at Camp Casey II, whichis on private property, the spokesman said.Like many others in Crawford, Sheehan's supporters are hoping for apeaceful weekend.Thaddeus DeJesus writes for the Waco Tribune-Herald.

D0904,D0904-B,"Australian Prime Minister John Howard appealed for calm while airborne and mounted police reinforcements were on alert as night fell in Sydney on Monday amid fears of fresh outbreaks of racial violence.More than 30 people were injured and 16 were arrested in some of the worst racial violence in Australian history as riots spread from south Sydney's Cronulla beach on Sunday afternoon to neighbouring suburbs overnight.The violence began when rampaging mobs of drunken white youths attacked people of Middle Eastern appearance at the beach, sparking revenge attacks by carloads of men who swept through nearby suburbs smashing dozens of cars.The city was quiet during the day Monday, but as evening approached police seized iron bars from a group of people who had gathered in the white working class suburb of Marouba.In the mainly Muslim suburb of Lakemba meanwhile, about 500 young people blocked roads near the local mosque after evening prayers, believing an attack was imminent. They later dispersed, some hurling rocks at police, local media reported.The police air wing and mounted officers were expected to patrol several suburbs during the night, national radio said.Prime Minister John Howard earlier condemned the violence and called for ethnic tolerance.""Attacking people on the basis of their race, their appearance, their ethnicity, is totally unacceptable and should be repudiated by all Australians irrespective of their own background and their politics,"" Howard said.He dismissed any suggestion his government's recent warnings about the possibility of attacks by home-grown Islamic terrorists had fuelled the rampage.""It is impossible to know how individuals react but everything this government's said about home-grown terrorism has been totally justified,"" Howard said, an apparent reference to the arrests last month of 18 Muslim men on terrorist charges.New South Wales state Police Minister Carl Scully said white supremacists and neo-Nazis were among those involved in the attacks.""There appears to be an element of white supremacists and they really have no place in mainstream Australian society, those sort of characters belong in 1930s Berlin,"" he said.More than 5,000 people gathered at Cronulla beach Sunday after email and mobile phone messages called on local residents to beat-up ""Lebs and wogs"" -- racial slurs for people of Lebanese and Middle Eastern origin.The move followed assaults a week ago on two white volunteer lifeguards at the beach, which is a popular gathering place for Muslims from inner-city suburbs, and allegations that local women were being harassed.One Muslim woman had her headscarf ripped off and was chased into a beach kiosk, local media reported. Six police officers were injured as they tried to quell the violence, and two ambulance officers were also hurt.A local member of parliament for Howard's Liberal Party, Bruce Baird, said he believed the beach rioting was partly fuelled by the 2002 and 2005 Bali bombings by Islamic militants in which scores of Australians were killed.The president of the Islamic Friendship Association of Australia, Keysar Trad, told AFP he disagreed with Baird's view that terrorism was the issue.""This was just an ugly racist genie that was let out of the bottle and we have to put it back in the bottle,"" he said.Muslims make up just 300,000 of Australia's 20 million people.Australian Arabic Council chairman Roland Jabbour said: ""Arab Australians have had to cope with vilification, racism, abuse and fear of a racial backlash for a number of years, but these riots will take that fear to a new level."" New South Wales state Premier Morris Iemma held talks with community leaders about how to prevent further violence, after reports that a second mass gathering was being planned for next Sunday.
Former Ku Kux Klan leader and presidential candidate David Duke said he was""shocked"" that Swedish authorities are investigating whether he violated racismlaws in a speech that he says simply promoted ""a lot of passion and love forEuropean heritage.""Duke _ chafing after Sweden's chief prosecutor ordered police to reopen a probeof whether he made racist remarks during a February speech to a gathering ofwhat authorities said were neo-Nazis in southern Sweden _ said that the claimswere an attack on his freedom of expression. Duke said that if he was charged,he would ""come back and challenge this.""Duke denied that there was anything inflammatory about the speech, telling TheAssociated Press in a telephone interview Tuesday night that ""there was nothinghateful about it. ... It condemns violence in any way.""""It's absolutely a speech with a lot of passion and love for European heritage,in particular the heritage of the people of Sweden, which is under threat frommassive non-European immigration,"" Duke said, speaking from Kiev, Ukraine, wherehe is teaching history and international relations at the private InterregionalAcademy of Personnel Management, known by its Ukrainian acronym,MAUP.The preliminary complaint against the former Louisiana state representative,filed by a Swedish man, had been dropped because he lives in the United States.But chief prosecutor Sven-Erik Alhem said he ordered the case reopened because""if he has committed a crime, it would be wrong to let him gofree.""Alhem said police would look into whether Duke can be tried for ""agitationagainst an ethnic group,"" a crime punishable in Sweden by up to four years inprison. It was unclear if Sweden would seek his extradition.Duke, who visited Sweden several times in 2004 and this year, contested theallegations, saying that the accusations against him are tantamount to ""anattack on the human and civil rights of the Swedish people. It hits at thefreedom of speech at its core.""Duke, whose vocal opposition to immigration and his pointed remarks about Jewsand other ethnic and religious groups have earned him a reputation as a whitesupremacist, said that as ""an American, I'm shocked that Sweden apparently haslaws against freedom of speech.""""They're saying it's somehow an agitation against Jews,"" said Duke. ""What isdoes is expose the racist position of extremist Jews, what I call Jewishsupremacists who support the apartheid state of Israel.""But he said he believes that once officials take a closer look at the speech, nocharges will be filed. Still, he said, he would not back away from afight.""If they chose to charge me, and they want to make an international issue of theoppression of free speech in Sweden, I will come back and challenge this,"" saidDuke. ""I will not run away from this. ... It's about the right of the Swedishpeople to hear a different view.""Duke rose to prominence in the United States after winning a state House seat insuburban New Orleans in 1989, despite his past as a Klan leader and avowedneo-Nazi.Distancing himself from overtly racist views, he made the runoff for governor in1991, alarming anti-racist organizations and drawing worldwide media attentionto Louisiana. He was soundly beaten in the runoff by Edwin Edwards, made a poorshowing in 1992 presidential primaries and failed to make the runoff in a laterrace for Congress.In 2002, Duke pleaded guilty to bilking his supporters and cheating on histaxes, and spent a year in federal prison, but later denied anywrongdoing.
A Jewish Defense League activist who was killed in a federal prison had receiveddeath threats because of his militancy and needed more protection byauthorities, his former attorney said.Earl Krugel, 62, was killed Friday evening at the Federal CorrectionalInstitution in Phoenix, where he was imprisoned for his role in a bomb plotagainst a Southern California mosque and the office of a Lebanese-Americancongressman.Attorney Mark Werksman questioned why Krugel was transferred to themedium-security prison last week. He had been in protective custody at LosAngeles' federal Metropolitan Detention Center in recent years, Werksmansaid.""There were death threats against him precisely because he was a militant Jewishactivist,"" Werksman said Sunday. ""So he always had to be watched and be guardedin federal custody in L.A.""Werksman couldn't recall details of the threats, but he said Krugel might havebeen targeted by white supremacists or Muslim extremists in thepast.FBI Special Agent Richard Murray said a homicide probe was under way butwouldn't confirm whether officials suspected white supremacists or otherinmates. Prison officials referred all calls to the FBI.Family members said Krugel had been at the Arizona prison for three days anddied after an inmate struck him in the head with a concrete block.Krugel, a former dental assistant from Los Angeles, was arrested in 2001 andcharged with conspiring to bomb the King Fahd Mosque in Culver City and a fieldoffice of Republican Rep. Darrell E. Issa.He pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in 2003, and was sentenced in Septemberto 20 years in prison.JDL leader Irv Rubin, who was also convicted in the case, slashed his neck andfell from a railing at the Los Angeles federal detention center exactly threeyears to the day before Krugel's death. Rubin died nine days later; his deathwas ruled a suicide.The Jewish Defense League was founded in 1968 by Rabbi Meir Kahane. Kahaneadvocated the forcible removal of Arabs from Israel. He was assassinated in 1990in New York.
Members of a neo-Nazi group staged a rally at City Hall on Saturday, two monthsafter plans for an earlier march set off a four-hour riot in which a mobattacked businesses and police.Hundreds of officers stood guard to make sure there was no repeat of the Octobermelee as about 60 white supremacists shouted at counterdemonstrators and heldplacards, including one reading: ""White race, stand up and take back yourneighborhood.""Nearly 200 others showed up in the freezing weather to protest against themembers of the National Socialist Movement.The counterdemonstrators, chanting slogans and carrying signs reading ""Go homeNazis"" and ""Stop the hate now,"" were kept behind barricades about 75 yards(meters) from the area where the neo-Nazis were cordoned off.After speaking for an hour, the neo-Nazis left in a caravan of cars, escorted byseveral police cruisers. Authorities reported only minor arrests and noviolence.In October, the neo-Nazis gathered for a march they said was intended to protestgangs and rising crime in a Toledo neighborhood. That plan set off a riot inwhich businesses were burned and looted and bricks were thrown atpolice.On Saturday, Police Chief Mike Navarre said about 700 officers from acrossnorthern Ohio were stationed through the downtown area. He said gang leaders andcommunity activists had offered assurances that counterdemonstrations would bepeaceful as long as the neo-Nazis were kept out of predominantly blackneighborhoods _ a key factor in October's disturbance.Police made 29 arrests, all for misdemeanor offenses that included disorderlyconduct, inciting violence and carrying a concealed weapon. There were noinjuries or property damage, Navarre said.A judge granted the city's request Friday to block the neo-Nazi group andcounterdemonstrators from rallying beyond the grounds of the downtown governmentbuilding.That kept the group about two miles (three kilometers) from the neighborhoodwhere the rioting broke out in October. Twelve officers were injured and 114people had been arrested after the earlier rally.
A heavy weekend police presence at beaches in southern Sydney prevented a repeatof racial violence that rocked this city a week ago and headed off ""potentialdisasters,"" a senior officer said Monday.""We feel that the police have been involved to the point where we have stoppedpotential disasters from happening in and around our beachside suburbs, so weare confident we averted potentially major tragedies,"" New South Wales stateAssistant Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione told television's NineNetwork.About 2,000 police took part in a major operation to maintain public order,stopping, checking and sometimes confiscating cars. Police also confiscatedseveral weapons and arrested a group of five men they said were suspected whitesupremacists who had a large drum of gasoline in their car along with helmetsand police radio scanners.
Race riots that led to the overthrow of this city's government in 1898 wasactually an insurrection that white supremacists had planned for months to stripblack residents of their rights, a state commission concluded.The violence in Wilmington, which resulted in the deaths of at least 22 blackspeople, ""was part of a statewide effort to put white supremacist Democrats inoffice and stem the political advances of black citizens,"" the 1898 WilmingtonRiot Commission concludes in a draft report.Afterward, white supremacists in state office passed laws that disfranchisedblacks until the civil rights movement and Voting Rights Act of the1960s.""Essentially, it crippled a segment of our population that hasn't recovered in107 years,"" said Harper Peterson, a commission member and former mayor ofWilmington. ""It's a major event that went unnoticed.""At the time of the violence, black men in North Carolina had been able to votefor some three decades as part of Reconstruction following the Civil War, saidJeffrey Crow, deputy secretary of the state Office of Archives and History,which researched the report.The United States abolished slavery in 1865.But within a year of the insurrection, the General Assembly was controlled byDemocrats and had passed the first segregation law that ended voting rights toblacks.The General Assembly established the commission in 2000. Its draft report wasopened for public comment last week.Some commission members have suggested financing historical exhibitions aboutthe riot and its consequences, portraying it in school history texts anddeveloping economic interests in affected areas.In addition, the state should issue some sort of apology for its inaction, saidIrving Joyner, vice chairman of the commission and a law professor at NorthCarolina Central University.___On the Net:Riot Commission:
A security guard arrested after police investigating race riots found weapons inhis Sydney home appeared in court Tuesday, where a prosecutor said he had linksto white supremacists.Andrew Sanders, 25, was arrested Monday after police found an unlicensed pistol,smoke grenades and pepper spray in a raid on his home.He also had been held Sunday night along with four other youths, after policeallegedly found petrol and other materials for making fuel bombs in hiscar.During Sanders' appearance at Penrith Local Court in western Sydney, policeprosecutor Jonathan Falzon said the security guard had logged onto a whitesupremacist Web site.Falzon also said that when police stopped the car Falzon was riding in Sundaynight, they found a two-way radio tuned to a channel being used by a whitesupremacist group called Fightback to update supporters on a protest in theaftermath of a race riot a week earlier.Sanders has been charged with five counts of possessing a prohibited weapon, anunauthorized pistol, and possessing a means of disguising his face with intentto commit an indictable offense. He was not required to enterpleas.""It's apparent that there are racial motivations behind what transpired there atBrighton,"" Falzon told the court.He said a 25 liter (6.6 gallon) drum of petrol, gloves, a first aid kit, aknife, utility belt, masks, police riot helmets and documentation relating tothe Fightback Web site were found in the car.Magistrate Ian McRae refused to jail Sanders pending trial, instead releasinghim on conditional bail until his next court appearance on Jan.27.McRae said Sanders could only leave his Sydney home if accompanied by hismother, ordered him to report daily to police and banned him from communicatingwith the four men he was driving with on Sunday night.Speaking outside court, Sanders' lawyer Phil Gibson commended McRae'sdecision.""Maybe (Sanders) is stupid, maybe he participates in some unusual recreationalactivities, but does that put him in a position where he's locked up while thesecharges are pending?"" Gibson told reporters.Sanders was arrested a week after rioting by 5,000 white youths erupted in thebeachside suburb of Cronulla following a gathering to protest the beating a weekearlier of two volunteer lifeguards by a gang of men witnesses described as ofLebanese descent.The riot sparked two nights of retaliatory attacks by carloads of youths ofMiddle Eastern appearance, shocking this city of 4 million that had prideditself on being a successful multiracial melting pot.Hundreds of police patrolling the suburbs since the riots have prevented arepeat of the violence and senior officers have declared it safe for people toreturn to the beaches after urging them to stay home last weekend.Also Tuesday, New South Wales political leader Morris Iemma said police wouldprosecute anybody found to have been involved in race hate messages linked tothe rioting that reportedly are circulating on the Internet.The postings include videos of race-based beatings and carry slogans such as""Not White, not welcome in Cronulla.""""Where they (the makers) break the law the law will be enforced and they will bebrought to justice,"" Iemma said.
Cox News Service WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Sept. 11, 2001,spawned great frustration and hatred against the perpetrators of thosedevastating attacks, as well as against ethnic and religious groupsthat many were already in the habit of hating. Forinstance, there is a widespread rumor that no Jewish peopledied in the World Trade Center, because they were thecause of its destruction after warning other Jews not togo to work there that day.rumor as well as looking at the roots and manifestations ofanti-Semitism in an ambling, but often eye-opening documentary, ""The Protocolsof Zion."" He takes to the streets of New Yorkand has no difficulty finding people of a variety ofbackgrounds who calmly express their prejudices against Jews. Sure thereare proud white supremacists who believe the Holocaust is amyth, but the virulence that Levin finds goes far beyondextremists to seemingly average folk.The film's title refers to a 19th-century Eastern European pamphlet thatspells out the Jewish plan to take over the world,another source of the systematic hatred. Understandably, perhaps, it wasa favorite tract of Adolf Hitler's, who had his ownstrategy for global domination. Those who insist another Holocaust againstthe Jewish people could never happen should spend an hourand a half with ""The Protocols of Zion,"" a chilling,though not surprising look at the world and one man'sjourney trying to get in touch with his much-maligned ethnicbackground.The verdict: A candid look at current manifestations of anti-Semitism inAmerica, all too openly expressed and acknowledged.
The 1898 riot and coup d'etat in Wilmington,N.C., that killed an unknown number of black residents actuallywas a planned insurrection that white supremacists spent months organizing.The violence was part of a statewide effort -- with apivotal role played by The News & Observer and othernewspapers -- to put white supremacist Democrats in office andstem the political advances of black citizens, according to adraft report released Thursday by the state-appointed 1898 Wilmington RaceRiot Commission.The incident is the only known violent overthrow of a governmentin U.S. history. Afterward, white supremacists in state office passedthe laws that would disfranchise a race of people forgenerations -- until the civil rights movement and Voting RightsAct of the 1960s.""Essentially, it crippled a segment of our population that hasn't recoveredin 107 years,"" said Harper Peterson, former mayor of Wilmingtonand a member of the commission. ""It's a major eventthat went unnoticed.""Now, with history fully told, members of the riot commission willturn toward action, perhaps asserting that there must be someatonement.""We want to engage people to come up with creative waysto respond to 106 years of degradation,"" Peterson said.To make amends, some commission members have suggested financing historical exhibitionsabout the riot and its fallout, portraying the Wilmington riotin school history texts, and developing economic interests in affectedareas.In addition, ""some apology by the state for its inaction"" isalso called for, said Irving Joyner, vice chairman of thecommission and a law professor at N.C. Central University.The commission has been ordered to make recommendations to the legislatureby May 2006. Whatever calls for action the commission advocateswill likely be hotly debated.""I don't want to let the cat out of the bagin terms of proposals,"" Peterson said. ""But they're going tobe very specific.""The General Assembly established the commission in 2000 in response toa push from two Wilmington legislators. The report is nowopen for public comment, and Joyner said he wants tohear suggestions about how the community should respond.In its 450-page report, the Wilmington Race Riot Commission describes theriot and accompanying coup d'etat as a watershed moment inNorth Carolina history.""Because Wilmington rioters were able to murder blacks in daylight andoverthrow Republican government without penalty or federal intervention, everyone inthe state, regardless of race, knew that the white supremacycampaign was victorious on all fronts,"" the report says.(STORY CAN END HERE)In 1898, African-American men in North Carolina had been able tovote for some three decades as part of Reconstruction afterthe Civil War, said Jeffrey Crow, deputy secretary of theN.C. Office of Archives and History, which researched the report.Blacks voted in blocs for the Republican party -- the partyof Abraham Lincoln -- and the GOP had formed acoalition state government in Raleigh with the Populist party.In Wilmington, the state's largest city at the time, blacks outnumberedwhites and were a force in the Republican city leadership.Democratic leaders, including Josephus Daniels, editor of The News & Observer,were outraged. They developed a campaign to install white supremacistleaders in the General Assembly and U.S. Congress during the1898 elections.""It's really kind of scary how organized it was,"" said LeRaeUmfleet, a historian with the state Office of Archives andHistory who authored the report. ""Every finger of the Democraticparty just reached into every aspect of economic, social andpolitical life at the time.""In The N&O, for example, Daniels published stories about community crimeand graft among elected officials in Wilmington. He hired acartoonist to pen racist images of ""Negro Rule,"" showing whitemen as victims and white women desperate for help.One cartoon, for example, showed a white woman surrounded by blackmen at the post office. It was drawn in responseto the hiring of African-Americans at the postal service andargued that white women now were afraid to call fortheir mail.Other papers, including the Charlotte Observer, the Wilmington Star and theWilmington News, also spread racially divisive propaganda.For months in 1898, white men calling themselves the ""Red Shirts""had been riding through the state's southeastern counties, wielding riflesand terrorizing residents.In Wilmington, Democrats fueled an insurrection. They stuffed ballot boxes andthreatened black men, but there was no widespread violence onElection Day.Then on Nov. 10, violence broke out when a mob ofnearly a thousand white men marched to a black-owned newspaperand set it afire. The editor, Alex Manly, had writtenan editorial months before suggesting that white women may enjoythe company of black men.Across the street, children at a black school saw the flamesand went running scared. Mothers, hearing the commotion, scrambled fortheir children. Residents ran to the nearby warehouse district towarn the African-American men working there.African-Americans fled the city as the newspaper building burned, with familieshiding in swamps and cemeteries for days with no morethan the clothing on their backs, Umfleet said.The white mob overthrew the democratically elected city council, whose membersweren't supposed to be up for election for months. Allblack city workers were fired. Leading black figures were forcedout of town.Many of the histories in the past century, including an autobiographyby Daniels, offered rationalizations for the riot, saying white leadersfelt pushed into violence by Manly's editorial, Umfleet said. Thenew report challenges those accounts.Within a year of the insurrection, the new, Democratic-controlled General Assemblyhad passed the first Jim Crow law cutting off votingrights to blacks.""It took the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Actto get those rights restored,"" Jeffrey Crow said. And today,he added, every time the Voting Rights Act comes upfor renewal in Congress, it's argued.""More than a hundred years later, we're still trying to resolvethe issues,"" Crow said. ""It's extremely important that people understandhistory.""
Beneath canopies of moss-draped oaks, on sleepy streetsgraced by antebellum mansions, tour guides here spin stories ofCape Fear pirates and Civil War blockade runners for eagertourists.Only scant mention is made, however, of the bloody rioting morethan a century ago during which black residents were killedand survivors banished by white supremacists, who seized control ofthe city government in what historians say is the onlysuccessful overthrow of a local government in U.S. history.But last week, Wilmington revisited that painful history with the releaseof a draft of a 500-page report ordered by thestate legislature that not only tells the story of theNov. 10, 1898, upheaval, but also presents a detailed analysisof its effects on black families that persist to thisday.Culled from newspaper clippings, government records, historical archives and interviews, somepreviously unexplored, the report explodes oft-repeated local claims that theinsurrection was a frantic response to a corrupt and ineffectivepost-Reconstruction government.""The ultimate goal was the resurgence of white rule of thecity and state for a handful of men through whatevermeans necessary,"" the historian LeRae Umfleet wrote in the report'sintroduction.The report concludes that the rioting and coup fully ended blackparticipation in local government until the civil rights era, andwas a catalyst for the development of Jim Crow lawsin North Carolina.""Because Wilmington rioters were able to murder blacks in daylight andoverthrow Republican government without penalty or federal intervention, everyone inthe state, regardless of race, knew that the white supremacycampaign was victorious on all fronts,"" the report said.In the period immediately after the Civil War, the Democratic Party-ruledgovernment in Wilmington, which was then North Carolina's largest city,was displaced by a coalition that was largely Republican andincluded many blacks. The loss of power stirred dissatisfaction amonga faction of white civic leaders and business owners.The tensions came to a head on Election Day, Nov. 9,1898, when the Democrats regained power, according to historians, largelyby stuffing ballot boxes and intimidating black voters to keepthem from the polls. Not waiting for an orderly transitionof government, a group of white vigilantes demanded that powerbe handed over immediately. When they were rebuffed, in thewords of the report, ""Hell jolted loose.""The mob -- which the report said grew to as manyas 2,000 -- forced black leaders out of town, dismantledthe printing press of a black-owned newspaper, The Daily Record,fired into the homes of blacks and shot down blackmen in the streets.Estimates of the number of black deaths are as high as100, state officials said, although they add that there isno way of truly knowing.""No official count of dead can be ascertained due to apaucity of records from the coroner's office, hospital or churches,""the report said.Black women and children fled to swamps on the city's outskirtsmade frigid by November's chill. There are accounts of pregnantwomen giving birth in the swamps, the babies dying soonafter.No white deaths were verified.Five years ago, members of the North Carolina General Assembly commissioneda report on the incident that they said would bemade part of the state's official record. The final reportis to be presented to lawmakers next year.The release of the draft report -- and its painful conclusions-- has been politely, if uncomfortably, received in this city.""I spend a lot of time looking forward and not alot of time looking in the rearview mirror,"" said MayorSpence Broadhurst. ""But we can use our history to growon. It was a horrible situation in 1898, and thisis 2005. But I think it is good for usto talk about it and to fully understand it.""(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)Styled after similar efforts to document racial atrocities in Rosewood, Fla.,and in Tulsa, Okla., the report begins with a thoroughaccount of Wilmington's status as the Confederacy's premier port, andthe complex structure of its black society, which included slavesas well as a sizable population of free black craftsmenbefore Emancipation. Rifts between black tradesmen and white Democrats inthe years after Reconstruction are chronicled, along with the growthof black society in prominence and power.In 1897, a year before the race riot, black residents numbered3,478, according to a directory for that year. By 1900that number had fallen to 2,497, according to data inthe report.According to the 2000 census, Wilmington had a population of 76,000.Nearly 71 percent of its residents were white, and 26percent were black.Federal and state authorities did nothing in response to the racialrioting in Wilmington, and according to the report, the revoltbecame a model of sorts when violence later erupted inother cities.A 1906 upheaval in Atlanta, the report said, ""suggests that thelack of governmental response to the violence in Wilmington gaveSoutherners implicit license to suppress the black community under theright circumstances.""In the years after the Wilmington rebellion, blacks and whites aliketended not to speak of it.""I did not even know it happened until I was agrandmother,"" said Lottie Clinton, 68, a lifelong resident of Wilmingtonand a member of the Riot Commission. ""My family thoughtthe more positive things I learned, the better off Iwould be.""Another commission member, Anthony Gentile, a Wilmington contractor, said he hadquestions initially about whether the report should have been doneat all.""We didn't want to keep open wounds open,"" Gentile said. ""Therewere a lot of emotions, and there was a lotof animosity. I was not in favor of doing it.""He continued, ""Everyone made mistakes 100 years ago; let's deal withtoday.""But, he said, ""My opinion changed, and I was surprised tolearn the depth of feeling that existed and that itwas not that long ago.""

D0905,D0905-A,"Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) will invest morethan NT$10 billion in developing wind power generation in the next 10years, a company spokesman said Sunday.The 10-year development plan is part of the state-owed firm'sefforts to substantiate the government's eco-friendly ""green powergeneration"" policy.Under the plan, Taipower will install at least 200 wind powergenerators with a total installed capacity of 300,000 kilowatts, thespokesman said, adding that the wind power generators will first beset up in coastal regions in western part of the island.
An amendment to the 2005 defense authorization billcurrently before Congress could immediately halt the development ofoffshore wind-power facilities in the United States, including acontroversial project planned for coastal Massachusetts, environmentalgroups and developers said this week.The amendment is being pushed by Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who sitson the House-Senate conference committee that will write the finalversion of the bill. The amendment would prevent the Army Corps ofEngineers, which oversees offshore wind power, from processing permitapplications until lawmakers draw up new regulatory guidelines.Proponents of the Massachusetts project say the amendment wouldstifle a burgeoning industry that they believe can make the UnitedStates less reliant on polluting fossil fuels at a time of rising oilprices. Warner, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, saidthe amendment is necessary to address shortcomings in oversight forsuch projects.``We need a more comprehensive regime, not unlike that for offshoredrilling in the oil and gas industry, to protect this very importantconcept of wind energy, which I support,'' he said in a telephoneinterview. He would not disclose whether the amendment will beincluded in the committee's report, which could come as soon asFriday. Once the bill is written, no changes can be made before a voteon passage.Although in its nascent stages in this country, wind power iswidely used in Europe -- providing Denmark, for example, with about 18percent of its energy. The first offshore project planned for U.S.waters is a privately financed, $800 million proposal to build 130turbines south of Cape Cod, Mass.Cape Wind Associates, the project's developer, says that in normalweather conditions, 40-story high towers could generate 170 megawatts-- 75 percent of the power used by Cape Cod and the islands of Martha'sVineyard and Nantucket.``This amendment would stop us dead in our tracks, putting thebreaks on offshore wind energy for years to come,'' said Mark Rogers,communications director for Cape Wind.The Cape Cod proposal has sparked a strong backlash from acoalition of wealthy and well-connected opponents, including someenvironmentalists. They say it will spoil the aesthetics of popularvacation communities, disrupt commercial fishing, and harm birds andmarine wildlife.A 4,000-page draft environmental impact study by the U.S. ArmyCorps of Engineers was completed last month after a nearly three-yearprocess. It was set to be released last month, but a Pentagon officialasked to review it first.``This project has undergone extensive environmental review, andthe public has a right to learn what the implications of it will be,''said Philip Warburg, president of the Conservation Law Foundation.``Clearly, there are powerful forces in Congress opposed to movingthis project forward.''A draft of the amendment, circulated this week, calls on Congressto outline environmental standards, establish requirements forcompetitive bidding and set public compensation for the use ofwaterways. Some of those issues were raised in a report last month bythe U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, which called the currentregulatory framework for offshore wind power ``inadequate.''Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who serves on the Armed ServicesCommittee and whose family owns a large home on Cape Cod, has spokenout against the project and supports establishing a national policy onoffshore development. Warner, who has two daughters with summer homeson Cape Cod, wrote in a 2002 letter to Army Undersecretary LesBrownlee that ``the location of such a large project on NantucketSound is questionable.''Warner said that the amendment is not related to his families tiesto Cape Cod and that he is mainly concerned with providing a frameworkfor wind-power developments in Virginia. A company called Winergy LLCapplied for an offshore wind farm permit from the Norfolk District ofthe Army Corps of Engineers, but that application has been withdrawn.In New York, the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) plans to build40 wind turbines off southern Long Island as part of a state programthat requires utilities to produce 25 percent of their energyportfolio from renewable sources by 2013. ``We would be discouraged byany effort that would prevent us from moving forward with thisimportant project,'' LIPA Chairman Richard Kessel said.
Wind turbines have been hailed as an environmentally friendly way toreduce the world's dependence on fossil fuels. But a wind farm withhundreds or even thousands of large turbines removes an enormousamount of energy from the air. So is wind power really benign?In one of the first studies to get at that question, scientists havemodeled the impact of a hypothetical large-scale wind farm in theGreat Plains. Their conclusion, reported in The Journal ofGeophysical Research, is that thousands of turbines concentrated inone area can affect local weather.The impact, said the study's lead author, Dr. Somnath Baidya Roy,comes not so much from the turbines' rotor blades slowing down theair but from atmospheric mixing that occurs in the blades' wake. Thiscreates warmer, drier conditions at the surface.""We found that it's the turbulence generated by the rotor that iscrucial when you talk about the impact on local meteorology,"" saidBaidya Roy, who did the research at Princeton but is now at Duke.The simulated wind farm in the study consisted of 10,000 turbines,with rotor blades 165 feet long, in a 60-by-60-mile grid innorth-central Oklahoma.In the Great Plains there is a nighttime stream of fast-moving airthat separates cool, moist air near the ground from drier, warmer airabove. The simulation found that the turbines catch this nocturnaljet, and the ensuing turbulence causes vertical mixing.The warming and drying that occur when the upper air mass reaches thesurface is a significant change, Baidya Roy said, and is similar tothe kinds of local atmospheric changes that occur with large-scaledeforestation. ""You might see some kind of convective clouds orscattered rainfall here and there,"" Baidya Roy said.He noted that the study was only preliminary, but that it pointed tothe need to improve rotor design to reduce turbulence.A wind farm of the size used in the simulation is much larger thanthose that have been built so far, Baidya Roy acknowledged, but it isnot out of line with what is being considered as more power fromrenewable resources is sought.""When you think of wind energy, people have a quaint idea of a lonewindmill by the river,"" he said. ""We are quite a ways from that,actually.""
There is a ""think globally, act locally"" rightness to the fact thatthe environmental report for the Cape Wind power project came on thesame day scientists laid out the dramatic effects global warming ishaving on the Arctic. The report on Cape Wind's 130-turbine proposalfinds few costs to marine or bird life that might outweigh theproject's benefits to both the environment and the economy.The 454-megawatt project would provide a source of pollution-free,renewable power that could displace fossil fuel sources in theregion. Unless the United States and the rest of the world getserious about global warming and sea-level increases, the Cape townof Orleans could be ""under the waves"" by 2100, according to PhilipWarburg, president of the Conservation Law Foundation.Much of that increased ocean water will come from the Arctic. It iswarming more than the rest of the planet, according to the report bythe eight-nation Arctic Council, which includes the United States. Asice and snow at the poles melt, the loss of their reflective surfacesleads to exposed land and water absorbing more heat. The four-yearstudy by 300 international researchers advances the consensus amongscientists that industrial society's increasing production ofgreenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide from fossil fuels, iscausing climate change.The Bush administration has refused to take any steps to curb carbondioxide emissions despite a promise by President Bush in 2000 to doso, and has indicated it has no plans to change that policy. Thisleaves it up to states like Massachusetts, which requires utilitiesto increase annually their use of renewable power sources, andCalifornia, which is pioneering a requirement that motor vehiclesreduce their carbon emissions.If Washington cannot take the lead in coping with climate change, theleast it could do is provide legislation for a better framework forwind or other renewable energy projects that use the ocean surface.But Congress has not made significant progress in passing a bill tocreate a leasing system for sites similar to one that exists foroffshore oil and gas drilling. The lack of such a framework is noreason to stall the Cape Wind project, which is now a step closer tobecoming a model for offshore wind power generation.Using current technology, it is more practical to build offshoreturbines fairly close to land, which means they can be visible innearby communities. The environmental report, prepared by the ArmyCorps of Engineers, includes a ""visual impact assessment"" by anarchitectural historian who states that the turbines ""will have anadverse visual effect"" on historic properties and locations in thearea. That may not be pleasant for some residents, but the supposedharm to a view is more than offset by the beneficial impact of theclean Cape Wind power.
As the clock begins ticking Tuesday toward a final decision on theproposed wind farm in Nantucket Sound, its chief opponent said thegovernment should allow more time for public response to a crucial4,000-page report that appears to pave the way for its approval.The new draft environmental impact report, prepared over three yearsby the Army Corps of Engineers, will be released in full Tuesday, butsupporters and opponents responded to details that became publicMonday morning. The findings are largely favorable to the project,suggesting that the 130 turbines proposed off Cape Cod would havelittle or no negative effect on the surrounding air, sea, and animallife.The public has 60 days to comment on the report before the Corpsissues a final version and makes a decision on the project, which isexpected next year.The report is by far the most important hurdle the controversialproject must overcome before construction begins. The draft gives thefirst public look at the federal government's official stance on the460-megawatt power plant.The Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, a group founded to block theproject, said Monday that it intends to ask the government to extendthe comment period to six months, saying that two months is toolittle time for the public to digest the enormous amount ofinformation in the Army Corps report.""A 60-day comment period during the holiday season on a complex andcontroversial project is unfair,"" said Susan Nickerson, of thealliance.Army Corps officials said Monday they would consider written requeststo extend the comment period, but had already added 15 days to theminimum required time of 45 days.Even though few had seen the entire report by Monday afternoon,reaction was swift from opponents and supporters after details werepublished by news agencies and summaries of the report were leaked.The two sides have begun lining up engineers and scientists to startporing over the document.""The struggle has just begun,"" said Charles Kleekamp, vice presidentof Cape Clean Air, an environmental group that supports the farm.Governor Mitt Romney, who opposes the project on aesthetic grounds,says the report downplays a key consideration for Massachusettsresidents.""I'm not surprised that the wind farm isn't going to kill fish orkill birds,"" said Romney. ""The question is does the wind farm impingeon the beauty of one of the great natural resources on the EastCoast, and it does.""Monday, the Army Corps of Engineers said few projects are blockedbecause of aesthetic considerations, in part because it is such asubjective matter. Supporters of wind farms have called the proposedturbines ""futuristic"" and ""beautiful,"" while opponents have calledthem a blight on an uninterrupted seascape.The Nantucket Sound wind farm, proposed by Cape Wind Associates,would be the country's first offshore wind farm. A host ofpoliticians have attempted to block the project since it was proposedthree years ago.If the Army Corps sticks to the 60-day public comment period, theagency is likely to issue a decision next year. Construction couldbegin soon afterward.""This is great news for citizens hoping to turn decades of rhetoricinto action on renewable energy,"" Cape Wind president Jim Gordonsaid, referring to the report's findings.The $13 million draft environmental impact report was paid for byCape Wind. Some 16 agencies and groups weighed in with comments anddata about potential impacts the farm would have, and the Army Corpsreceived hundreds of individual comments.Cape Wind's involvement in the report has drawn critics, includingNickerson, who says the Army Corps was overly reliant on datacollected by consultants paid for by the developer. They also faultedthe Army Corps' hiring of TRC, a national engineering firm with anoffice in Lowell, to help put the federal document together.Nickerson said TRC would be bound to write a favorable review becauseit works on wind issues, among others.Army Corps officials said they specifically hired TRC as anindependent third party because they have an energy background andexperience with similar reports. A spokeswoman for TRC saidNickerson's comments were untrue.""TRC deals with all kinds of energy. The idea they would be biased toany particular energy source is ridiculous,"" said spokeswomanSamantha Guerry.Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, whose familycompound would overlook the project, issued a statement saying theproject shows the need for better rules to govern what he sees as thebequeathing of public ocean to private interests.Massachusetts Attorney General Tom Reilly said ""We cannot allow thefederal government to give away 24 square miles of pristine waters toa private developer. ... [W]hat is happening here is wrong.""With promises of an enormous fight brewing, both sides remainedoptimistic. Marc Breslow, director of the Massachusetts ClimateAction Network, which supports the plan, said he had only seen abrief summary of the report Monday, but if it is accurate,""completion of a final [environmental report] should be doneexpeditiously, and assuming no environmental surprises, Cape Windshould move forward without further delay.""Beth Daley can be reached by email at bdaleyglobe.com
Nantucket Sound lies between Cape Cod, Nantucket Island and Martha'sVineyard, some of the nation's best-known vacation spots. Now aprivate company is proposing to build the world's largest offshorewind power plant right in the middle of it. Depending on who istalking, the results would be either a hideous blot on the landscapeor a significant step toward clean power and energy independence.The argument over the proposal intensified last week, when the ArmyCorps of Engineers issued a draft environmental impact statementfinding few flaws in the proposal. But instead of helping to settlethe question, the report fed the debate over building there and where-- or whether -- other wind farms should be built in the nation'scoastal waters.The 4,000-page draft gives new support to environmental groups thatpraise the project as a safe, nonpolluting and desperately neededalternative to fossil fuel power plants. But opponents challenge thereport, the process that produced it and the idea of building theturbine array in the first place.Regardless of its environmental impact, they say, it is just too ugly-- an industrial development that would wreck pristine vistas in amajor tourism area. Many add that no offshore energy projects shouldbe considered until the government establishes a better reviewprocess for proposals to use federal lands offshore.The project would be the nation's first offshore wind power plant,and it is being closely watched up and down the Eastern Seaboard. Asimilar proposal is under consideration off Jones Beach, on LongIsland, and officials in New Jersey are looking into offshore windpower.The Corps of Engineers' draft concluded that the project, proposed byCape Wind Associates of Boston, would not unduly hinder ferryoperations, commercial and sport fishing, boating, aviation or otheractivities at its site, a 24-square-mile area in the part ofNantucket Sound called Horseshoe Shoals. It said the project's 130support towers, turbines and blades, which together would rise about420 feet above the water, would not seriously affect currents, waves,water quality, sand movement, fishing conditions or noise levels.Adequate steps can be taken to protect marine mammals and shellfish,the report said. Birds will fly into the towers and die, thestatement says, but probably at a rate of only about one a day, notenough ""to cause bird population declines.""And while opponents predict that the field of towers would drive awaytourists, the corps said the project might actually attractsightseers.The report is preliminary, and the public will have at least untilJan. 10 to comment on its findings, said Karen Adams, who supervisesthe permit process for the Corps of Engineers. A final environmentalreview may be completed as soon as a year from now, she said.Mark Rodgers, a spokesman for Cape Wind, said the company must stillraise the capital needed to build the project. But if all goes well,he said, the plant could be producing power as early as 2007. Thepower would go into the regional grid, not precisely to Cape Cod andthe islands, he said. But on a day with average wind, it wouldproduce about 420 megawatts -- three-fourths of average electricityneeds for the local area.(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)""Many of the more hysterical fears that opponents had been speakingof in the past three years were not supported in this analysis,""Rodgers said of the impact statement.(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)But that is no surprise, according to the Alliance to ProtectNantucket Sound, an organization that opposes the wind farm. As isrequired, Cape Wind paid for the work that went into the report. ""Asa predictable result,"" the alliance said in a statement, ""thedocument is strongly biased toward Cape Wind.""Adams and the project's supporters dismiss that criticism. The corpsrequires applicants to pay for studies of their proposals, she said,because it would not be right for taxpayers to pay for them. Thecorps independently chose the experts who produced each section ofthe report, she said, and Cape Wind willingly financed whatever thework the corps requested.She added, however, that some in the corps did not expect to findthemselves in the position of issuing federal permits for theproject. ""We had to do a lot of learning real quick,"" she said.But some officials -- including Gov. Mitt Romney, Sen. Edward M.Kennedy and Rep. Bill Delahunt, whose congressional district includesthe project site, say the project should not go forward yet. They sayoffshore projects of all kinds need a more systematic federal reviewprocess. (Sen. John Kerry says he will await the final environmentalimpact statement before taking a position.)(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)Advocates of the wind farm say establishing such a process would onlymean unnecessary delay. And several environmental organizations havefound themselves in the unaccustomed position of praising the Corpsof Engineers, which many have criticized in the past as being tooquick to approve development projects.""At first, obviously, it was pretty frightening because of theirhistory,"" said Kert Davies, U.S. research director for Greenpeace,which favors the project. But he added, ""I think the effort was verysolid, and they were under a lot of scrutiny.""Davies also dismissed as ""an elitist and local view"" assertions thatthe wind turbine array would spoil a pristine environment. NantucketSound is far from that, he said, filled as it is with ""mega boattraffic and jet skis and fishing boats and ferries -- it is not theGrand Canyon these guys are painting it to be.""Others say that regulatory issues aside, the aesthetics are perhapsthe biggest issue standing in the project's way. ""It's a legitimateconcern,"" said Bruce Bailey of AWS Truewind, a research firm inAlbany, N.Y., that consulted on the Cape Wind project.But, he said, ""It's based on expectations, not based on what peoplehave actually seen."" He said photo simulations of what the wind farmwill look like from shore -- it will be 4.7 miles away at its closestpoint -- assume the clearest of weather conditions. Often, he said,the distant view from shore is obscured by haze, so the turbineswould not be so obvious.Besides, advocates say, a diminished view is a small price to pay forclean power. ""If we are not willing to accept that tradeoff, I thinkit says something pretty profound about our priorities and ourcommitment to moving to cleaner sources of electricity,"" said RandySwisher, executive director of the American Wind Energy Association,which represents developers, suppliers, consultants and others in thewind power industry.The corps' statement did not address in detail another criticismopponents have voiced: that the project is economically viable onlybecause of tax credits or because the federal government is givingthe company free use of the site, issues that some say should beconsidered in a broader federal review of development of offshorelands.But advocates contend that all kinds of fossil fuel energy projectsbenefit from federal incentives. And Rodgers, the Cape Windspokesman, said that ""non-extractive"" users of coastal lands --companies that run telecommunications cables and the like -- are notrequired to pay for the privilege. Still, he said, should the federalgovernment decide to require lease payments, the company would""absolutely"" pay.Rodgers said the site offered several important advantages. It is inthe middle of an area whose population -- and electricity demands --are growing. And it is a short distance to Barnstable, where powergenerated by the windmills can feed into the national grid.Similar considerations are prompting interest in offshore wind poweron Long Island and in New Jersey, several experts said. ""It'sdifficult to site a large wind development in the Northeast,"" Swishersaid.Advocates of wind power cite Denmark as an example, saying thecountry generates 20 percent or more of its energy from wind, andDavies of Greenpeace says the record there suggests that offshorewind farms can become tourism destinations. ""In Denmark, day sailorstake off and sail to these things,"" he said.He and others at environmental groups said they hoped the Cape Windproposal would win final approval and would become the first of manyoffshore wind projects. ""The United States,"" he said, ""is way behindin the clean energy race.""
Colorado utilities will have to sell a lot more electricity from windpower in years to come under a statewide ballot initiative approvedby voters on Nov. 2, and if they want some pointers they might talkto Adam T. Kremers, a 19-year-old sophomore at Colorado StateUniversity here. He's been there and done that.Kremers sold wind power to the occupants of individual dormitoryrooms this fall, under a deal between the university and the localutility that environmentalists describe as one of the first suchprograms in the nation.Kremers, an environmental engineering major and the associatedirector of environmental affairs in the student government, gave outstickers and pinwheels shaped like turbines and threw a ""wind powerparty"" to celebrate clean energy, complete with a cake connived fromthe dining hall.He ultimately got 187 students -- nearly 4 percent of theuniversity's 5,000 residence-hall population -- to sign up, payingfrom $17 to $52 a year extra to buy green power to run theircomputers and lava lamps.""It's a start,"" he said. ""Now it's my duty to keep it going.""Colorado voters said much the same thing when they approved, over thevehement objections of most energy companies, a proposal mandatingthat 10 percent of the state's electricity must come from wind andsolar power by 2015.The new law, called Amendment 37, makes Colorado the 18th state withan environmentally friendly energy standard, but the first one tohave bypassed the Legislature and put the rule into place throughreferendum. An energy bill similar to the one the voters approved wasdefeated by Colorado's legislature three times in the last threeyears.""Because it's a conservative Western state with a strong fossil-fuelindustry, as well as the first one passed by a popular referendum,Colorado represents something of a breakthrough,"" said Alan Nogee,the energy program director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, anonprofit research and advocacy group based in Cambridge, Mass.And Fort Collins, a city of 118,000 people dominated culturally bythe 25,000-student university got there first.The city created its own wind energy program in 1998, and its ownrenewable energy standard in 2003 -- a step that only a few othermunicipalities in the nation, notably Chicago and Austin, Texas, havetaken.Under the program, about 2 percent of the city's customer base andelectricity load now comes from wind power, purchased from wind farmsin Wyoming through a nonprofit power authority. The idea is that eachpurchase of wind power fed into the grid offsets fossil-fuel use.Colorado gets most of its electricity from burning coal.It was from that municipal utility framework, city and schoolofficials say, that the dormitory project took root. And just likeAmendment 37, which clawed its way onto the ballot through petitions,what happened on the campus came entirely from the bottom up. Peoplelike Kremers and a former student, Britta Schroeder, his predecessorat the student government's environment job, prodded and pushed untilthey found a way.""It was almost all exclusively the students doing this,"" said CarolDollard, a utility engineer at the university who got involved in theresidence hall project. The pitch to the administration, she said,was that wind energy would be an entirely optional added cost forstudents, and that the grunt work would be done by the studentsthemselves. ""We sold it as zero cost, zero effort,"" she said.Kremers, who has a quotation from Gandhi on the door of his dorm room-- ""Be the change you wish to see in the world"" -- considers the newstate law a wonderful boost to what's happening on campus.Fort Collins officials are more guarded. They say that as one of asmall number of ""home rule"" cities that run their own electricsystems in Colorado, they want to opt out of the new state lawbecause they believe their energy program is better.It is certainly more ambitious, requiring 15 percent of the energysold in city limits to come from wind sources by 2017, 50 percentmore than the state requirement. City officials also don't like theidea of interference by the state Public Utility Commission, whichwill oversee the statewide standards, and they worry as well that theLegislature could amend the plan.The Fort Collins city council voted to remain neutral on Amendment 37before the election. Statewide, the measure got the support ofslightly more than half the electorate -- 53.4 percent voted for it,to 46.6 percent against.""Does the PUC have jurisdiction over a home-rule city? That's whatpeople were worried about,"" said Michael B. Smith, the generalmanager of utilities for Fort Collins. ""We will be closely watchingwhat happens.""Environmentalists who backed Amendment 37 noted that it includesspecific language intended to protect Fort Collins, and other citiesthat might join its ranks with local standards, allowing them toself-certify out of the program.But they also admitted that because the measure was passed as anordinary state law, it could be amended by the Legislature -- orrepealed, though hardly anyone expects that to happen -- and that thePublic Utility Commission will also have to work out the details ofenacting it over the next year.""It's a statute, so the legislature can change it however it seesfit, but I would hope that since it was passed by the voice of thepeople, they would respect that,"" said the measure's principalauthor, Rick Gilliam, a senior energy policy adviser at WesternResource Advocates, a nonprofit environment law and policy center.""My hope is that we would at least go forward into the PUC realmbefore the legislature tinkers with it.""At the university, plans are under way for next year's wind campaign.Dollard, the utility engineer, said that one proposal would extendthe wind power option to individual professors, and departments thatmight want to buy some or all their energy from the city's windprogram.""It was a three-year process to get the residence halls through, sowe've said let's not take on too many things until we've learned thelessons from the first part,"" she said.Kremers, meanwhile, is plotting how to get financing for hissecond-year marketing plan. He wants to print up advertising cardsthat could be put in every mailbox of next year's incoming freshmanclass -- about 5,000 students -- and he has a strategy in mind.The university's recycling committee, mostly composed of faculty andadministration, works on issues like reducing waste in the dininghalls, and he is the student representative on the board.""The recycling committee has a good budget,"" he said. ""We'll see.""
Green Mountain Energy is offering Texas electricity consumers anenvironmentally friendly service at a rate matching that of ReliantEnergy -- a sign of a growing interest in green energy and the risingprice of traditionally produced power.Touted as a ""pollution free"" plan, Green Mountain Energy gets thepower it sells from wind turbines and hydroelectric plants and willcost about 11.1 cents per kilowatt-hour, the same price currentReliant Energy customers are paying.Houston-area electricity customers can pay as little as 9.6 cents perkilowatt-hour, a rate offered by Houston-based Gexa Energy. Othercompanies, like Starlight Electric and Cirro Energy, also offer ratesbelow the price Reliant charges.The Green Mountain plan, a 10 percent wind- and 90 percentwater-generated mix, is about $9 per month less expensive than the100 percent wind plan Austin-based Green Mountain currently offers,based on the use by a typical customer.The new offering reflects a maturing of the electricity market fromone where only early adopters would pay the extra money for greenpower to a market where renewable power is attractive to a broaderrange of customers, said John Savage, Green Mountain's senior vicepresident of marketing.""Some see it as a way to counter the country's dependence on foreignoil; others see it as a way to promote good environmentalstewardship, and others see it as being consistent with their faith.""Savage said.The power in Green Mountain's 100 percent wind plan comes fromturbines operating in Texas, but most of the hydroelectric power inthe new plan is generated in neighboring states, such as Arkansas andOklahoma, Savage said.While the power that arrives at a Green Mountain customer's home inTexas won't necessarily be from a hydroelectric plant, Green Mountainwill buy a sort of ""renewable power credit"" from a hydro plant thatgenerated the electricity and sold it to another user.Green Mountain's plan also reflects the narrowing price gap betweenrenewable power and power made by more traditional methods, such ascoal and natural gas, said Tim Morstad, an analyst with ConsumersUnion.Since 2002, the price electric consumers pay to Reliant Energy, knownas the price-to-beat, has gone up 28 percent, or 2.48 cents perkilowatt-hour. Most of that is a result of rising costs, primarilynatural gas.""On the renewable front, it does bode well that customers can choosemore environmentally friendly power for the price most residentialcustomers pay,"" Morstad said. ""But this is also a signal that theprice to beat has gotten very high.""The cost of renewable energy hasn't necessarily dropped, either.While the cost of wind power is supposed to stay relatively stablecompared with power generated by coal and natural gas, Green Mountainrecently increased the price of its 100 percent wind product. Becausethe company must buy some power on the open market to meet customerneeds, it is also subject to the fuel price increases imposed by itssuppliers, Savage said.Reliant Energy does not offer a renewable energy plan in the Houstonarea -- state electricity deregulation laws allow it to offer onlyone plan here until Jan. 1, 2005 -- but it has offered a plan toDallas-area customers for several years.Jim Robb, Reliant's senior vice president of retail marketing, saidthe renewable plan has been priced to roughly match the cost of theDallas area's incumbent provider, TXU. The power comes from acombination of wind and landfill-produced natural gas.""We haven't seen major evidence of increased interest in a renewableproduct,"" Robb said, noting that about 1,400 customers have signed onto its plan. ""We could offer such a plan in Houston next year if wefind customer demand, but we haven't gone to the expense of marketingthe plan.""There are no other renewable energy plans offered in the Houstonarea. Spokesmen for Entergy and TXU note that renewable sources arepart of their mix of power generation. TXU is the fourth largestcontractor of wind power in the country, while Entergy has severalhydroelectric facilities.Green Mountain has 600,000 customers in eight states but does notoffer a state-by-state breakdown.
Ugliness can be good for you -- especially if you are not rich,powerful, or politically connected.After a massive draft environmental analysis, the controversialproposal to construct a wind farm in Nantucket Sound is coming downto aesthetics. Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney -- a supposedlypro-business, anti-government-regulation, cold-blooded venturecapitalist -- made that clear during recent testimony before the USArmy Corps of Engineers. ""We cannot trash this extraordinaryresource,"" Romney said, referring to Nantucket Sound. "" . . . I'veseen wind farms, and they are not pretty.""Two days later, the Romney administration announced support forwindmill projects in Florida and Monroe in western Massachusetts.Residents there also worry about the aesthetics of 20 340-foot tallturbines and the overall impact on streams, wetlands, and woodland.And that raises a question: With government under pressure to developrenewable energy, will controversial alternatives be foisted solelyon poorer, less politically influential areas?The proposed Nantucket Sound project would be the country's firstoffshore wind farm. The structures would stretch 417 feet high fromthe water's surface to the tallest blade tip and would be visible 4miles away on Cape Cod and more distantly from Martha's Vineyard andNantucket. Some environmental groups, including the Conservation LawFoundation and Greenpeace believe the trade-off in terms of energyand pollution savings is worth it. But Cape Wind Associates, thedeveloper behind the proposal, is fighting the wealthy andwell-connected, including Senator Edward M. Kennedy and other Kennedykin along with some average Cape residents.As for Romney's loud opposition, the governor could be feelingpressure from Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly's strong effort tochallenge the project. Or, perhaps he is feeling another type ofpressure?Opposition to Cape Wind is organized through the Alliance to ProtectNantucket Sound, which spent $2.4 million fighting the proposed windfarm in 2003. On forms filed with the IRS in 2003, Christopher, Jack,and Michael Egan are listed as directors. Jack and Michael Egan arecurrent board members. They are sons of Richard Egan, founder andchairman emeritus of EMC Corp.The Egans are major political players. Here, while they alsocontribute to Democrats, they are big Romney fund-raisers. The EganFamily Foundation was the main funding source for a $100,000 surveydone by the Beacon Hill Institute. It concluded that lower propertyvalues, reduced tourism revenue, and a loss in year-round jobs wouldresult from the wind farm. The Egan Family Trust owns property inCotuit overlooking Nantucket Sound, and Michael Egan owns a home onGreat Island, off Yarmouth, overlooking Nantucket Sound.Ernie Corrigan, a spokesman for the alliance, said, ""This is not apolitical issue at all."" Opposition is ""a matter of common sense.""Asked if the Egan family involvement influenced Romney's positionregarding Cape Wind, Romney aide Eric Fehrnstrom replied via e-mail:""No, not at all."" Asked to explain Romney's shifting positions,Fehrnstrom, said, again via e-mail: ""Gov. Romney supports efforts toencourage greater reliance on renewable sources of energy. There areseveral areas in the Berkshires region where wind farms have recentlybeen approved. And there are a number of different areas off thecoast of Massachusetts that we could also consider. They may not beoptimal for the developer from a profit-making point of view, but weneed to balance the public and private interest. Nantucket Sound is anational treasure. The governor does not want to turn it into a windfactory. He wouldn't recommend putting a wind farm in the middle ofthe Grand Canyon, or at the foot of Mount Rushmore, either.In the Berkshires, legal challenges are underway. Under the currentplan, ""a year from now, turbine number 16 will be the third highestpoint in Massachusetts,"" says Eleanor Tillinghast, co-founder ofGreen Berkshires, Inc., a group formed to oppose wind farm power. ""Webelieve the aesthetics are equally as valuable here. Nantucket Soundis a national treasure, so are the mountains of westernMassachusetts."" But, she says, western Massachusetts is being left tothe mercies of the free market system, where small towns sufferingfrom budget cutbacks are ""willing to sell their wind, because whatelse do they have to sell?""What a sorry way to run a state energy policy: Give to the have-notswhat the haves don't want.

Near this blustery headland where Admiral Nelsonwon his great naval victory over the French two centuriesago, a new battle of Trafalgar is brewing.But the ships involved today are only small fishing boats, wantingto protect their livelihood.Two companies plan to build large clusters of windmills in thesea just off this stretch of Spain's southern shore, agritty place of sand dunes, lagoons and sharp brown reefs.With about 400 offshore turbines, they want to capture thepower of the winds that blow almost constantly here, atthe cusp of two seas, the Atlantic and the Mediterranean.Fishermen respond that these phalanxes of giant towers near the coastwill make their tough jobs even more difficult. ""This iswhere the tuna pass and this is where we work,""said Manuel Ponce Alva, leader of fishermen's protest movement, wavinga marine map covered with ominous red arrows.The men from the fishing villages of Barbate, Vejer and Conilhave knocked on many official doors to argue that thesewind farms will disturb the migration of the young tunaand, more dramatically, that their own lives may be atstake. They say the towers, to be based some 10miles offshore, will force their small vessels to make largedetours in the already treacherous waters near the Strait ofGibraltar.""We talk and talk, and we ask,"" said Antonio Varo, anotherangry fisherman. ""We get no answers.""Their protests may well fall on deaf ears. The windmill projectsare part of a drive by Spain to expand itsoutput of native renewable energy. Spain is already one ofEurope's largest producers of wind power, second only to Germany,and its present capacity of 8,500 megawatts can supply closeto 5 percent of the country's electricity. Indications are thatthis may double by 2010.In this country, where almost all oil, gas and coal mustbe imported, the wind rush has been under way formore than a decade. Privately owned ""wind parks,"" encouraged byofficial subsidies, first sprouted on the hills near here, behindTrafalgar and Tarifa. The gleaming white towers then spread tothe rest of the country, to the windswept north andthe central highlands.Like the old stone windmills that have dotted Spanish horizons forcenturies, the modern turbines are all on land. But nowSpanish entrepreneurs want to join Europe's booming new trend ofbuilding large wind farms offshore.The seabed off Cape Trafalgar, one of six marine sites beingstudied, is a favorite. There are no important tourist resortsnearby, although visitors often come here from Britain, where ""Trafalgar""has a special ring. Binoculars in hand, people climb tothe tip of the cape, a knobby dune with alighthouse on top. Here they peer out at the waterwhere 60 British, French and Spanish warships clashed in 1805in the battle that established Britain's naval supremacy for thenext century.Cesar del Campo, director of a consortium involved in the windpark plans, said the site is difficult because of thewater depth and the speed of the currents, but thatthe energy yield would be high. ""You have to seethe Strait of Gibraltar like a huge fast-moving river thatchanges with the tides,"" he said. ""Some days there maybe heavy gusts from Atlantic storms, but you can counton wind every day.""The building cost can be twice as high as on land,though, offsetting the larger yield. It means driving piles intothe sea floor, laying cables to the shore and doingriskier maintenance work.But specialists say the rush is on now for offshore windenergy, and northern Europe is leading the way. Wind farmsbased at sea today still have a modest capacity of600 megawatts, but this is expected to grow more thantenfold by 2010, said Corin Millais, director of the EuropeanWind Energy Association. Companies, including utilities, have staked out tractsin the seas off Britain, Denmark, Germany, Ireland and theNetherlands.The incentive is evident, Millais said, because Europe's oil and naturalgas reserves are running out and energy imports, now at50 percent, will rise further. The European Union, moreover, hasbeen pushing for alternatives to fossil fuels as part ofits commitment under the Kyoto treaty to reduce greenhouse gases,and it wants 22 percent of its electricity to comefrom renewable sources by 2010.Many projects have been delayed because officials everywhere are demanding stringentenvironmental impact studies. These are still under way for theTrafalgar wind fields, and it remains to be seen whetherthey will support the fishermen's position. The area is onthe flight path of tens of thousands of eagles, ducks,storks, swallows and many other birds crossing to winter inAfrica. Daniel Lopez Marijuan, of the association of Ecologists inAction said, ""The first studies have shown that migrating birdsdo not fly very low here, unless a storm takesthem off their course.""There are other stakeholders, including two nearby NATO bases, the operatorsof a gas duct that comes to Spain from NorthAfrica and the heavy shipping traffic in and out ofthe Mediterranean, but planners say their studies show the windmillspose no obstruction.If that is true, the fishermen along the Trafalgar coast maybe alone in confronting the powerful lobby of wind producers.""There is good money in wind,"" said Rafael Bayo, anengineer and energy consultant. ""That is why many hilltops nowhave windmills. A farmer used to get nothing from hishill, now he rents it to a utility or putshis own windmills there.""This may continue, he believes, as long as the government paysgrid operators the difference between conventional and wind generated electricity,on average two or three cents per kilowatt-hour. Eventually, someexperts think, wind power may become competitive as turbines getbigger and as pollution taxes are imposed on fossil fuelenergy, as planned.Manuel Bustos, who represents the association of wind producers, said hisgroup would try to convince the fishermen that they maybenefit from the offshore project. He said that in Europeanpilot projects, fish farms have been attached to sea-based windmills.In another experiment, the underwater base of the mill wasused to create artificial reefs to act as fish nurseries.At Barbate, the fishermen said they had never heard ofthis.Should the Trafalgar plans fail, then offshore parks may go elsewhere,given the Spaniards' hunger for wind profits. ""There are dozensof projects waiting for licenses, on land and offshore,"" Bustossaid. ""Enough to produce another 50,000 megawatts.""
","Europe leads the way in producing energy from wind. It is planned that by 2010, 22% of its electricity will come from renewal sources. Denmark already receives 18% of its energy from wind power. Four hundred turbines are to be built in the sea off the coast of Spain. Fishermen claim they will disturb tuna migration and force their boats into treacherous waters. A U.S. plan to build 130 turbines in the ocean south of Cape Cod is meeting strong opposition from residents of nearby resorts who say the turbines would spoil the view, disrupt fishing and harm birds. ","The first US offshore wind turbine plan was in Nantucket Sound. Opponents of offshore wind power sought a more comprehensive strategy for wind energy and argued it would spoil vacation area aesthetics, disrupt commercial fishing and harm birds and marine life. One study found the proposal would have little effect on the surrounding air, sea, and animal life or fishing conditions. Another study concluded the turbines could alter local weather. Fishermen opposed clusters of windmills on Spain's southern shore because they would disturb tuna migration and necessitate dangerous detours. ","Proponents of wind turbine generated power consider it a safe, pollution free, way to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. It counteracts global warming by reducing greenhouse gases and preserves oil and natural gas resources. They contend there is no harm to the local environment and even attract sightseers. Opponents primarily consider wind farms to be a blight on the landscape that lowers property values, tourism and jobs. They expect off shore farms to disrupt commercial shipping, harm birds and marine life, and impact sport and commercial fishing. Land-based farms are deemed to affect local weather, vegetation and wildlife. ","Proponents of wind power assert that it is a safe, non-polluting, renewable alternative to fossil fuel. Opponents say that the turbines are ugly, disrupt fishing, harm birds and marine wildlife, and affect local weather. Wind power is widely used in Europe, both on land and offshore. Now the first U.S. off-shore wind farm has been proposed for Nantucket Sound. Opponents emphasize the aesthetic impact of the project, while a draft environmental report said that it would not hinder commercial or sport activities nor would it kill birds or fish or affect currents, water quality, or noise levels.

D0905,D0905-B,"On the site where border guards used to keep watch on the western outpost of the Soviet Union, Baltic European Union newcomer Estonia is erecting a wind farm to generate clean electricity.The wind-swept Pakri peninsula, which juts into the Baltic Sea 60 kilometres (36 miles) west of the capital Tallinn, once hosted a training centre for Soviet border guards. The nearby town of Paldiski was a key Soviet nuclear submarine training ground.Today, sleek silver arms of the state-of-art wind power turbines dot the site which was off-limits to civilians throughout the five decades of Soviet occupation from 1940 to 1991.The first three windmills of the Pakri Wind Farm have just been put into operation, with five others to follow before the end of the month.When the farm is fully up and running, it is expected to supply one percent of Estonia's energy needs, and a some 10,000 Estonian households are expected to get electricity from the farm.""Paldiski has been associated with the Soviet border guards and military pollution,"" said Hannu Lamp, managing director of the Tuulepargid company which is developing the wind farm. ""From now on, it will have a new side to it, as a clean energy place.""Tuulepargid is the Estonian subsidiary of Danish-based Global Green Energy.The streamlined wind turbines with a hub height of 80 metres (yards) and rotor diamete 3,800 residents has struggled with its Soviet military legacy. In addition to changing the face of Paldiski, the Parki Wind Farm is setting a precedent in the region in the carbon pollution quota market.Under the Kyoto Protocol's implementation project, 0.5 million tons of reduced greenhouse gas emissions will be sold to Finland.""It's among the very first wind power projects anywhere where the economic feasibility is achieved through the sale of CO2 reductions under the joint implementation scheme of the Kyoto Protocol,"" Lamp says.On January 1, the EU opened a market for trading in carbon dioxide and other gases which are the main culprits for global warming.The total investment cost of the Pakri project is 24 million euros.The wind farm owner, Pakri Tuulepark, is a subsidiary of Norway's Vardar energy group.Most of Estonia's energy is generated using oil-shale fueled power plants, which are big pollutants.With an expected annual production of 56 GWh (GigaWatt hours), the Pakri wind farm will meet about one per cent of Estonia's net electricity consumption, and thus contribute to achieving Estonia's target of providing 5.1 percent of its electricity needs from renewable sources by 2010. Developers have already made plans for building more wind farms on other former Soviet military installations in Estonia.
The Irish authorities on Wednesday ruled out a proposal for a wind farm overlooking one of Ireland's oldest religious sites after objections from pilgrims.The Hibernian Wind Power company wanted to build 12 wind turbines on a site overlooking St Patrick's Purgatory on Station Island in Lough Derg, the country's most arduous pilgrimage venue.Supporters of the sanctuary, the Friends of Lough Derg, said the development would overlook the ancient monument and traditional pilgrimage site and ""interfere with its tranquillity both audibly and visibly"".Planning Board inspector Stephen O'Sullivan concluded the wind farm and its 65 metre (200-foot) high turbines would ""seriously injure the visual setting of Lough Derg in a manner which diminished its cultural heritage value"".The island in the Donegal lake near the border with British ruled Northern Ireland is amongst the oldest centres of Christian pilgrimage in the world, supposedly dating back to the 6th century.A regime of medieval mortification and cleansing for barefoot pilgrims is still practised today.It involves three days of fasting, reciting mantra-type prayers while walking on the sharp stones of the island's 'penitential beds' and no sleep for 24 hours.The Purgatory got its name from a legend that Ireland's patron saint, Patrick, endured the temptation of the devil in a cave on the island.Pilgrims have ranged from King Harold of England in 1050 to Ireland's President Mary McAleese.Last year an estimated 30,000 people from 27 countries made the pilgrimage. 
The Netherlands on Wednesday granted licenses for seven offshore wind parks asthe country seeks to boost renewable energy sources.The Ministry of Science said it expected as many as 20 wind farms, with up to2,000 turbines, to be constructed off the North Sea coast in the next fewyears.The names of the companies granted construction permission were not released,but the statement said they had applied first and submitted environmental impactstudies.""To reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, the Netherlands has set a target of6,000 megawatts of wind energy,"" the statement said. ""The first parks will bebuilt by 2006.""Two projects have already begun.The British energy company BP PLC has started work on a windmill park in theAmsterdam harbor with peak capacity of nine megawatts, enough to provideelectrical power to around 5,000 houses.The country's first major offshore wind turbine project, with 100 megawatts ofcapacity, is under co-management by the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Cos. andDutch utilities company Nuon NV.
Chiayi Magistrate Chen Ming-wen agreedTuesday in principle to a wind energy investment project proposed bythe Germany-based Infra Vest Group, which plans to set up 97 windturbines in coastal areas of the southern Taiwan county.Chen gave the nod to the investment plan with conditions attachedafter hearing a briefing by Infra Vest officials. The magistrate stipulated that the group must cooperateunconditionally in future infrastructure construction and must fullycommunicate with local residents and environmentalists. He alsodemanded that the group come up with compensation and feed-backmeasures before moving into further negotiations.According to Infra Vest officials, the group has decided toinvest NT$16 billion (US$500 million) in setting up 97 wind turbinesin Chiayi's coastal areas after carrying out various in-depthinspections of the area.Stressing that the Tungshih and Putai areas are extremely rich inwind power and resources, they said the group is planning to installsix turbines there in the initial stage. Each will have the capacityof between 12 million and 18 million watts, generating 51 millionkilowatt-hours per year, they explained.They said the plan will cause no pollution, low noise, and noexhaust gas or waste water, and pointed out that electricitygenerated by wind energy is increasing at a fast pace of between 15percent and 30 percent every year in advanced countries such asGermany and Denmark.In these strictly eco-friendly nations, wind energy has largelyreplaced traditional coal, gas, nuclear power or other fossil fuelfor power generation, they said, adding that the group has madesimilar investment plans in Brazil, France, mainland China, Spain,Sweden and Turkey.Investment in wind energy should bring fourth profit. This isnecessary for a sustainable development of renewable energies, adistinct goal of many governments, Infra Vest said at its Website.It is our strong belief that this goal can only be achieved byproper plans and commercially viable projects that can also createlocal economic benefits, it said, calling wind energy clean,competitive and inexhaustible that will heed public concerns overenvironmental protection and conservation.Infra Vest has already held a seminar in Putai township toexplained the investment plan to local residents. It has gainedsecurity confirmations from the Ministry of National Defense and theCivil Aeronautics Administration, as well as initial land useapproval from the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau.At present, the state-run Taiwan Power Company maintains fourwind power turbines in offshore Penghu County and is consideringadding another four due to its better-than-expected capacity, in linewith the Kyoto Pact that will become effective this summer in severalparts of the world to cut emissions of greenhouse gas.
Four new windmill towers and turbinesrising from the crown of John Paul Jones Hill will begin powering theU.S. Navy base here next month, saving $1.5 million in annual oilimports, reducing pollution and showing energy-starved communistneighbors what they are missing.The wind-generation project that will provide 25 percent to 30percent of the base's energy needs is a rare embrace of renewableresources for the U.S. military, which can seldom justify the highstart-up costs or efficiently extend new technologies to the small,scattered communities they serve.At Guantanamo, where the population has grown fourfold since thebase began housing hundreds of suspected enemy combatants capturedmostly in Afghanistan, favorable winds and Pentagon-mandated energyindependence have converged to allow the base to boast the largeststand-alone hybrid wind and diesel power system in the world,according to its developers.Two of the four windmills, each capable of generating 950 kilowattsof electricity, are operational, and the other two will be online bythe end of the month, said the Naval Facilities Engineering Command'sMark Leighton, who is overseeing the project.Augmenting the wind power are two new diesel generators thatoperate more efficiently and cleanly than the Cold War-era units theyare replacing, which will boost annual fuel savings to $2.3 milliononce all the new technology is activated in the next few weeks,Leighton said. The equipment also will cut carbon dioxide output atthese pristine southern shores by 13 million pounds a year.Though the wind project boasts economic and environmental advances,those behind it concede there is little likelihood of expansion, hereor at other military bases.Guantanamo is unique in its need to remain separate from itscommunist-ruled host and neighbor, and the narrow hilltop where thefour stanchions are planted cannot accommodate more. The pillarsstanding 185 feet above the hilltop are embedded 35 feet into theground, each tethered below the surface with 22 ``soil nails.'' Otherhigh land on the windward side of the base divided by Guantanamo Baymight be suitable, but the cost would be prohibitive compared with thebenefit, Leighton said.Similar wind parks have been erected at two other militaryinstallations, said Beverly Wade, project facilitator for a Navyprogram that invites private contractors to invest in moreefficient-energy development in return for the project's savings. Shesaid other renewable-energy projects on military bases includedsolar-heated swimming pools at the Norfolk Naval Station andground-source heat pumps at Oceania Naval Air Station, both inVirginia.``The problem with renewables in the past has been that it's moreexpensive up front and not necessarily tried-and-true technology,''Wade said. ``Now it's turning out that with the cost of (fossil-fuel)energy, renewable prices aren't looking so bad.''The Guantanamo contractor, Noresco of Connecticut, invested $20million in the windmills and new diesel generators. The company isentitled to the projects' savings for 14 years, which Leightonestimated at $41 million. The windmills have life spans of at least 20years, meaning the Navy will enjoy the savings for several yearsbeyond the contractor's repayment term.Guantanamo has been self-sustaining in utilities for 40 years, ableto produce its own water and electricity to remain independent of theCuban government, said the base public works officer, Cmdr. JeffreyJohnston. After Cuban leader Fidel Castro threatened to cut off waterto the base in 1964, a desalination plant was built, providing anindependent source but boosting electricity demands that until now hadbeen met by diesel generators.The power is mostly needed to produce water, Johnston said, andGuantanamo's water needs have risen with the base's population, whichwent from 2,500 three years ago to nearly 10,000 as the main detentionfacility for terrorism suspects.``The water needs for the base have been very complicated becausewe were small, then large, then small again, now large again,''Johnston said of the Guantanamo operation, which has shrunk andswollen with the times, including when it housed waves of interceptedrefugees from Haiti and Cuba a decade ago.``I don't know enough about the future of this base to invest toomuch more'' in energy or water production, Johnston said. ``We are buta flotilla of Haitians away from being a base of 30,000 people. Icould draw realistic scenarios that have this base at three times itsneeds now or one-third.''While the wind turbines replace diesel power produced by plantsthat consume $24 in fuel a minute, their contribution to the baseelectrical grid can't be efficiently increased beyond the four units.Unlike diesel-powered plants that can be operated as needed, wind isvariable and unpredictable, Johnston said. The good news, he added, isthat peak wind times on the base tend to coincide with peakconsumption hours of late afternoon and early evening.The windmills will also help the base overcome a chronic problem ofpower outages. Because the base network of diesel generators lacks thebackup power supplies that a private utility company would have at itsdisposal, breakdowns, though usually short in duration, often put thelights out across the base until the problem can be fixed.Johnston and the base commander, Capt. Leslie J. McCoy, noted thatCuban military officials with whom they met periodically had beenkeenly interested in the wind project, which is now$the most visiblefeature of the base from any direction.``The Cubans are very intrigued by the wind generators, but I seeno potential for sharing the technology at this time,'' McCoy said,alluding to the absence of diplomatic relations with Havana and atrade embargo that has been in place since shortly after Castro cameto power in 1959.Cuba has suffered widespread and protracted electricity outages inrecent years as the price of oil has driven up production costs. Thecountry has invested little in developing alternative energyresources.Whether the Navy and its neighbor might collaborate in wind-powerproduction if more amicable relations are achieved is ``difficult topredict,'' the base commander said.
After four formal hearings, one so packed withpassionate speakers that it had to be reconvened for asecond time on Tuesday afternoon, the public has just abouthad its say on a proposal to install a giantwind farm in offshore waters south of Cape Cod.But consensus appears to be as far away as ever, withadvocates and opponents deeply divided on the project and avast majority still ambivalent.On Tuesday, the project was variously described as relying on outdatedtechnology or as a beautiful alternative to strip mining, theequivalent of industrializing the Grand Canyon or a way tolead the nation once again to independence, this time energyindependence.""Five percent on each side are passionate,"" and the remaining 90percent are unsure, Larry Rosenberg, a spokesman for the ArmyCorps of Engineers, said at a public information session convenedon Saturday by the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative, a state agency.The project, put forward by Cape Wind Associates of Boston, aprivate concern, involves 130 turbines to be arranged in agrid occupying 24 square miles of Horseshoe Shoals, in NantucketSound. Each tower, with its turbines and blades, would reach420 feet above the water.Karen Adams, who supervises the permitting process for the corps ofengineers, said it would be at least six or sevenmonths before the corps made a decision on the permit.Several state and local agencies have yet to weigh infirst, Adams said, ""and they all have to say yes""for the permit to be approved.Although the session on Tuesday was the last public hearing, thepublic comment period has been extended through Feb. 24.Advocates said the turbine array would ultimately produce about three-fourths ofthe electricity now used on Cape Cod, Nantucket and Martha'sVineyard, reducing the region's reliance on fossil fuels. That, inturn, would reduce the risk of global warming, the nation'sdependence on imported oil, pollution and pollution-related diseases like asthma,they said. Others said they liked the idea of awind farm because it would bring jobs to the region,the towers would attract fish and the wind farm mightbecome a tourist attraction.Opponents say that the project might be a good idea, butthat Nantucket Sound is the wrong place for it. Theynote that the installation would be the first of itskind in the nation and say that it relies onunproved technology that has run into trouble elsewhere. In particular,they criticized the corps draft environmental impact study for theproposal. As is routine, it was paid for by theproject applicant, Cape Wind, an arrangement that opponents said taintedits generally upbeat assessment.Some opponents, including Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, whose family compound inHyannisport would have a view of the towers, said noprojects should be approved in Horseshoe Shoals, or other federalwaters, until the nation had a more coherent policy fordealing with offshore lands generally.Two recent reports, one by the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policyand the other by the Pew Oceans Commission, made similarrecommendations, and last month the White House announced that itwould pursue the idea.Greg Watson, a vice president at the technology collaborative, said hisgroup had not taken a stand on the proposal, eventhough much of its mission involved the encouragement of renewableenergy like wind.The collaborative organized the session on Saturday ""as a neutral broker,""Watson said, because it was important that the public haveconfidence that the project, if it went goes forward, wasbeing done right. Otherwise he said, ""it will set backthe cause of renewable energy.""
A California wind-energy company is eyeing Colorado and Nevada as locationsto build the nation's largest wind turbines.Clipper Windpower Inc. said the two states are finalists in thecompany's plan to build a plant that would produce anew line of wind generators soaring 435 feet into theair.The manufacturing and assembly plant initially would employ 75 workers andultimately could grow to as many as 550 employees, earningannual salaries averaging $42,000, Clipper Windpower chief executive Jim Dehlsensaid.Clipper plans to unveil a prototype of the new turbine --minus its 300-foot-diameter rotor -- in Denver in May atWindpower 2005, the annual conference and exhibition of the AmericanWind Energy Association.Clipper's new turbines will generate a maximum of 2.5 megawatts, makingthem two-thirds more powerful than the 1.5-megawatt units made byGE Wind Energy that are used at the Lamar windfarm.One megawatt of continuous electricity serves about 650 homes. Because thewind blows sporadically, one megawatt of wind capacity serves about240 to 300 average homes.Industry analysts said Clipper's large turbine could bring significant improvements inthe economics of wind energy.""Larger turbines make a tremendous difference in the cost competitiveness ofwind power"" compared with coal and natural gas, said GarySchmitz of the Golden, Colo.-based National Renewable Energy Laboratory.While larger turbines produce far more power than smaller units, theirground ""footprints"" -- the amount of surface area they occupy-- are only slightly larger.For example, a wind farm under development by Clipper in Marylandwill produce 100 megawatts using the company's new turbines, comparedwith 70 megawatts if smaller turbines were used on thesame amount of acreage.In addition, the rotors of the larger turbines are higher inthe air, causing fewer bird and bat deaths from collisionswith blades.While wind power is widely embraced for its environmental benefits, somecritics dislike the noise and visual impact of wind farmscontaining hundreds of turbines.The proposed ""Cape Wind"" project with 130 turbines in offshore waterssouth of Cape Cod, Mass., has been controversial because ofcomplaints that it would interfere with pristine ocean views.Clipper Windpower's plan is to build three manufacturing plants in theUnited States, one each in the West, Midwest and East.That will help the company reduce transportation costs by placingfactories closer to wind farms.Privately owned Clipper was founded in 2001 by Dehlsen, a wind-energypioneer. The Carpinteria, Calif.-based company developed the $55 million, 44-megawatt Flying Cloud wind farm in Iowa, and did preliminarydevelopment work on another Iowa wind project that is oneof the nation's largest.Dehlsen's former company, Zond, developed the 1.5 megawatt turbine that hasbecome the industry standard. Zond was acquired by Enron in2000, and after Enron's implosion the company's wind business waspicked up by GE Wind.Capitalizing on the fast-developing wind-power market, GE has become one ofthe world's major turbine manufacturers.After the federal production tax credit on wind energy recently wasrenewed, inducing a surge of new wind-farm proposals, GE landed$1.3 billion in new orders for turbines.Dehlsen now finds himself in the ironic position of competing againstthe popular turbine he helped create.Although he hasn't announced pricing for the 2.5- megawatt turbine, heexpects its cost per megawatt will be slightly less thanthat of GE's 1.5-megawatt unit.The GE turbines sell for $1.3 million to $1.6 million each,Dehlsen said. That indicates that Clipper's larger turbine could bepriced at slightly less than $2.5 million.Dehlsen said the Clipper machines will use sophisticated components that willmake the turbines more efficient than others on the market.When the 2.5-megawatt turbine is rolled out this year, Clipper'srevenues gradually will shift from wind-project development fees to salesof the turbine.Clipper expects to make a decision on the location of itswestern manufacturing facility by the end of this month, Dehlsensaid.The company's big turbine is attracting plenty of attention in theindustry, said Tom Gray, executive vice president of the Washington-basedAmerican Wind Energy Association.With the dollar weak against foreign currencies, American wind-farm developers increasinglyare looking to domestic turbine makers instead of European giantssuch as Vestas and Siemens.""It seems likely that (the Clipper turbine) will improve the economicsof wind energy,"" Gray said. ""Any time a new turbineof that size from a new manufacturer comes to market,that's a significant event.""
In a move that could give Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney morepower over the proposed Cape Cod wind farm, state andfederal officials appear to have come up with a uniqueplan: Move the coastline.State officials said Tuesday that a pile of rocks the sizeof a sport utility vehicle in Nantucket Sound may redefinethe borders of Massachusetts, expanding state waters about 12 squaremiles. The expansion would push back federal waters, which couldimperil a developer's bid to erect the country's first offshorewind farm, 130 turbines in the sound.The US Minerals Management Service is expected to post a noticeabout the border change in the Federal Registry by theend of the month, said Jon Carlisle, a spokesman forthe Executive Office of Transportation, which oversees state boundaries. Statewaters stretch 3 miles from where officials draw the border.Federal waters extend from that point to another 200 milesoffshore.""From our review of the landmass, that's the appropriate new border,""said Carlisle, who declined to comment on whether Romney pushedfor the new borders to curtail the wind project. ""Reallyone thing has nothing to do with another.""Romney and other state politicians, such as Senator Edward M. Kennedy,oppose the project's planned location, but they have limited powerto block it if it is entirely within federal waters.Last July, Romney asked the Army Corps of Engineers to postponeits long-awaited review of the proposed wind farm, arguing thenewly discovered rocks might require changing the state border.If that happened, he suggested in a letter, the developer mighthave to redraw plans or seek new permits from stateagencies. ""This may dramatically alter the proposal your agency iscurrently reviewing,"" the governor wrote. An Army Corps official dismissedthe request at the time as a thinly veiled attemptto stop the project.While details remained sketchy Tuesday night, the new boundary appears tocut into as much as 10 percent of the windfarm's proposed footprint, affecting 10 to 13 turbines, state officialssaid.Cape Wind Associates, the project's developer, has seen its proposed turbinesbecome a focal point in a growing national debate overocean management. A company official said Tuesday night that theyhad not seen the proposal, but that they doubted itwould seriously affect the project. The company has already reducedits original proposal by 40 turbines.A US Army Corps of Engineers draft environmental impact report onthe project is in a public comment period until laterthis month. The Army Corps is expected to make afinal ruling on whether the project can be constructed withinthe next year, the biggest hurdle that Cape Wind mustovercome.""We are going to await receiving this document, and we wantto evaluate it closely before we respond,"" said Mark Rodgers,a Cape Wind spokesman. ""At this time, it does notappear this will have any significant impact on the CapeWind Project.""The effort to change the state's borders began about a yearago, after the Minerals Management Service asked the Massachusetts HighwayDepartment to survey the landmass, which is about 2½ milesoff Cape Cod, Carlisle said. The Highway Department, which documentsstate lines, determined the landmass to be a ""natural occurrence""and recommended the federal agency change the state's borders, hesaid.Globe correspondents Emma Stickgold and Amanda Pinto contributed to this report.
Texas lawmakers are joining clean-energy advocates in an effort to dramaticallyexpand the use of wind and solar power and otherrenewable energy sources across the state.Texas, the nation's largest electricity consumer, has one of the bestrenewable energy programs in the country, but some lawmakers andadvocates say the state has yet to fully tap thoseresources.The resulting savings could dramatically cut electricity bills and power plantpollution.State Sen. Troy Fraser, R-Horseshoe Bay, has introduced a bill inthe Legislature that would require 10 percent of the state'selectricity to come from renewable energy sources by 2025.The state now mandates that about 2.7 percent be derived fromrenewable sources by 2009.""Longterm, this is good public polcy for the state,"" Fraser said.""This is a good hedge against fossil fuels and ourdependence on foreign oil.""A coalition of clean-energy advocates and environmentalists is pushing a strongerproposal. It would require by 2020 that 20 percent ofthe state's energy production be derived from renewable energy --a whopping 17,820 megawatts, or enough electricity to power 4.9million homes.The 20 percent proposal does not have a legislative sponsor.But any expansion of reewable energy will require building miles oftransmission lines to carry the electricity produced by wind turbinesto urban areas.The state estimates that it will cost $1 billion to buildtransmission lines to support an additional 5,000 megawatts of windpower. The money to pay for those transmission lines wouldprobably come from fees based on electricity usage, officials say,meaning industry would be hit hardest.""I don't want to give the impression that we're not willingto work on the issue, but transmissionto get wind powerfrom West Texas and other remote areas of the stateto market can be very expensive,"" said Phillip Oldham, chiefcounsel for the Texas Coalition for Competitive Electricity, which representslarge commercial and industrial consumers.""To the extent that renewable energy is cost-competitive and beneficial tothe state, we have no issue with it being incorporatedand think it serves a valuable purpose,"" he said. ""Tothe extent that the infrastructre costs outweigh the benefit ofit, then we have concerns.""Renewable energy proponents agree that transmission capacity must be improved.But Tom ""Smitty"" Smith, a member of the Texas Renewable EnergyIndustries Association, the clean-energy group pushing the 20 percent proposal,said the cost has been exaggerated.Smith, also director of the Texas chapter of Public Citizen, saidthe cost would be spread over decades and would addno more than $1.06 to the average monthly residential electricitybill.The Union f Concerned Scientists, a 100,000-member partnership of scientists andcitizens, conducted a detailed study of both proposals at therequest of the coalition.The 34-page analysis, released this month, concluded that both proposals wouldslash residential and industrial energy bills by at least $5.5billion in the next two decades, as well as createthousands of permanent jobs.""But the 20 percent standard would actually provide significantly grater economicdevelopment and environmental benefits,"" said Jeff Deyette, an energy analystwith the group.The union estimates that 38,290 jobs would be created by the20 percent proposal. It would also slash an estimated 34,000tons of smog-forming pollutants a year by curtailing coal-fired powerplant production, Deyette said.Fraser said the state needs to proceed cautiously to make surewind power, in particular, can handle the job. For instance,Texas' peak electricity demand occurs in Jly, August and September,when the state's winds decline sharply.""We need to be somewhat deliberate as we go forward inmaking sure that there's a balance,"" Fraser said. ""That balanceis more than putting in the wind turbines, it's havingthe transmission to transmit it, and then having a backupsource for reliability.""Texas is already a national leader in renewable energy. In June1999, the Legislature adopted one of the nation's first, andat the time largest, renewable energy prorams.""I think it's fair to say that Texas was viewed asa pioneer,"" said Stephen Wieland, business development manager for Vestas,a Danish wind turbine manufacturer.Texas set a national record in 2001 by installing more windpower capacity in a single year than any state inany previous year. Much of the buildup took place atthe King Mountain Ranch ""wind farm"" in McCamey, about 75miles south of Midland. It is the world's largest windpower project today.But in the past several years, 15 states have surpassed Texa'program. New York, California and Hawaii have enacted requirements thatat least 20 percent of energy companies' output be fromrenewable sources by 2020.(Online: Union of Concerned Scientists, www.ucsusa.org.

Banking giant Goldman Sachs said Monday it will buyZilkha Renewable Energy, a Houston firm with about a half-dozenwind energy projects operating or under development.The deal will add even more power generating assets to thebank's existing portfolio and put a deeper set of pocketsbehind wind projects in California, Illinois, Kansas, New York andother states.Terms were not released.Wind power accounts for less than 1 percent of all electricitygenerated in the United States, but new wind turbine installationhas grown by 24 percent a year since 2000, accordingto the American Wind Energy Association. And 2,000 megawatts ofwind farms are expected to be installed this year, a30 percent increase over existing capacity. One megawatt is enoughpower to light about 300 homes.""Goldman Sachs believes that wind and other renewable forms of energywill become an increasingly important part of the world's energymix, and we aspire to play a leading role inthis high-growth industry"" said Goldman Sachs Chairman and CEO HenryPaulson Jr. in a statement.Goldman Sachs has major holdings in energy development, energy finance, powermarketing and commodities trading. The company has more than 30gas and coal-fired power plants acquired through deals with NationalEnergy Gas & Transmission, El Paso Corp., and Congentrix, andhas interests in wind farms in Oregon, Wyoming and nearPalm Springs, Calif.Zilkha has interests in two projects currently generating power -- the75-megawatt Blue Canyon Wind Farm in Okla., and the 24-megawattTierras Morenas wind farm in Costa Rica -- and manyother projects in various stages of development. The two closestto completion are the 200-megawatt Flat Rock project in NewYork and a 150-megawatt second phase of the Blue Canyonproject.Zilkha Renewable co-owners Selim Zilkha and his son Michael Zilkha willmaintain a financial interest in the company, while Michael willcontinue to serve on the board. The business will continueto be based in Houston with the same management team.For many years the wind power business has been the beneficiaryof an $18 per megawatt-hour federal tax credit that hasbeen allowed to expire three times in the last sixyears, notes Michael Swisher, executive director of the American WindEnergy Association. The credit is to expire again at theend of this year, and the industry group is callingfor the credit to be extended for at least fiveyears.""The 'on again, off again' nature of the tax credit ismore a function of the political process,"" said Michael Skelly,vice president of development for Zilkha. ""Our view is thatthere will continue to be support at the popular leveland within Congress for wind energy.""The tax credits certainly help the wind energy industry look moreattractive to investors, but as prices for power plant fuelscontinue to rise and the wind turbines become more efficient,the industry becomes more competitive on its own terms.Selim Zilkha, 77, and Michael Zilkha, 50, are well known inHouston for their ties to the energy industry and fora number of high-profile philanthropic efforts.The elder Zilkha was at one time the largest single shareholderof El Paso Corp. In 2003, he helped fund anunsuccessful bid to replace the company's board of directors. Hehas since sold his shares in the company.
","In eco-friendly nations, such as Germany and Denmark, wind energy has largely replaced traditional coal, gas, oil and nuclear for power generation. There, wind-powered energy is increasing 15 to 30 percent per year. Big investments in wind power are also being made in Brazil, France, mainland China, Spain, Sweden and Turkey. In 2001, Texas set a U.S. record by installing more wind power capacity than any other state. But recently, 15 states have surpassed Texas's record. New York, California and Hawaii have enacted legislation requiring that 20% of energy companies' output must come from renewable sources by 2020. ","Advocates say a Nantucket wind farm could produce three fourths of electricity needs for the Cape Cod area. Wind farms can reduce reliance on fossil fuel, global warming, and, pollution. It could bring jobs, fish and perhaps a tourist attraction. Opponents argue that Nantucket is the wrong place for a farm. The plan relies on unproved technology. A large wind turbine project is planned in Taiwan. A proposed wind farm overlooking Ireland's oldest religious site was ruled out for fear it would disrupt the sanctuary's tranquility. ","Wind power proponents believe the technology will become competitive as the cost of fossil fuel rises and larger turbines are brought online. Turbines are touted for their low noise and the lack of exhaust gas or water. Two negatives with wind power are its dependence on the changeable weather and the distances of farms from population centers. Opposition to wind power becomes more ferocious when planned farms are believed to infringe on the vistas of the wealthy and political influential or on historical, religious sites. ","Advocates for the Nantucket Sound off-shore wind farm maintain that the farm would bring jobs to the area, that it might be a tourist attraction, and that the towers would attract fish. Opponents say that it relies on unproven technology and that this is the wrong location. A German group building a project in Taiwan claims that it will cause no pollution, low noise, and no exhaust gas or waste water - it is clean, competitive, and inexhaustible. In Ireland a project near a very old pilgrimage site was abandoned because it would ""interfere with its tranquility."" "
D0906,D0906-A,"Usually sunny southern California has been whipped the past few days by storms that have killed at least two and caused floods, mudslides, power blackouts and deadly traffic accidents.A man died and another was injured in Los Angeles' Elysian Park when a hillside collapsed and buried the two in the tent in which they were sleeping on Saturday night, officials said.The victims ""were sleeping in a tent at the top of the hill when the hill gave way,"" Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey said.In Malibu, on the Pacific coast, an accident caused by the rain sent a car into the ocean, leaving one dead and four wounded.A man and his two children were rescued from the rubble of their hillside home in Studio City after it collapsed in a heavy downpour.The three were taken to hospital with minor injuries.Residents of Santa Clarita had to be evacuated due to floods while the Coldwater Canyon neighborhood of Los Angeles was strewn with fallen trees.The latest storm started Thursday and was predicted to continue Monday with more rain and, in the mountains, snow.Hundreds of cars were stranded in the snow in San Bernardino National Forest, east of Los Angeles. About 12,000 Los Angeles residents were without power, officials said.""This is something we only see about every five to 10 years,"" National Weather Service Meteorologist Dan Keeton said of the turbulent weather.
As stormy weather continued to pound SouthernCalifornia on Saturday, about 170 people were freed from cars near BigBear where they had been trapped for up to 15 hours in deep snow,several of the state's major arteries were closed and rescue workerspulled two people from raging streams.Serious concerns remained about how the water-logged region wouldhold up with storms expected to continue at least through Sundayevening. Although there appeared to be no major flooding or mudslides,the day was not without drama.Rescue workers used snowplows, snowcats and snowmobiles to freepeople from a 6-mile stretch of California Highway 18 in the SanBernardino Mountains after a combination of snow, rain, sleet and fogcreated a 200-vehicle logjam. Although many of those stuck along theroute spent the night in their cars, there were no major injuries.In Rosemead, rescuers plucked a woman from a wash after watercarried her nearly a quarter of a mile. San Bernardino Countyfirefighters used a bulldozer to rescue a man from a swollen waterway.Several of the state's major arteries were closed because of snow,rock slides and weather-related accidents.Cities along the coast received from 1 to 4 inches of rain, whilemountain regions reported as much as 8 inches.The California Highway Patrol reported 430 accidents as of 6 p.m.in Southern California -- double last Saturday's total for the sametime period.Forecasters expected rain to continue most of Sunday beforediminishing. A flood watch remained in effect for Los Angeles, Orange,San Diego, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, and flash floodwarnings remained for San Bernardino County.Times staff writers Jason Felch, Jack Leonard, David Pierson andJoel Rubin and staff photographer Rob Gauthier contributed to thisreport.
A fourth day of thrashing thunderstorms began totake a heavier toll on southern California on Sunday with at leastthree deaths blamed on the rain, as flooding and mudslides forced roadclosures and emergency crews carried out harrowing rescue operations.In Elysian Park, just north of downtown, a 42-year-old homeless manwas killed and another injured when a mudslide swept away theirmakeshift encampment. Another man was killed on Pacific Coast Highwayin Malibu when his sport utility vehicle skidded into a mud patch andplunged into the Pacific Ocean. Ventura County officials reportedSunday that a 20-year-old man died north of Ojai as he tried to crossa rain-gorged creek Saturday, wearing a harness attached to a wire.For others, it was a day of close calls.Dozens of people fled threatened neighborhoods from Santa Claritato San Dimas. In the Hollywood Hills, a family narrowly survived astheir two-story home collapsed, apparently in a torrent of mud.Hundreds of motorists skidded into minor traffic accidents.Unresolved Sunday was the fate of a Highland man who remainedstranded but safe in a San Bernardino County cave as raging watersoutside prevented rescuers from reaching him. ``The only way to get tothe cave is to cross this water, (but) it's flowing too heavily. It'stoo dangerous,'' said Cindy Beavers, a spokeswoman for the SanBernardino County Sheriff's Department.The storms had stalled over an area of the Pacific Ocean on Sundayevening, a few hundred miles off the coast of Point Conception, westof Santa Barbara, said Bruce Rockwell, a weather specialist with theNational Weather Service.``It's stationary off the coast and constantly pumps in moist waterfrom the south,'' he said.Forecasters had originally said some areas of southern Californiamight receive more than 20 inches of precipitation over the weekend.Although they later reduced that estimate, a campground near MountWilson, Opids Camp, received 20.8 inches of precipitation just between4 p.m. Saturday and 4 p.m. Sunday.In that same time period, downtown Los Angeles received 4.5 inchesof rain, Beverly Hills 7.8 inches, Santa Monica 4.7 inches, Chatsworth5.8 inches, Claremont 7.5 inches and Lancaster 2.4 inches.Continued downpours were expected through Tuesday, when the jetstream airflow from the north was expected to start pushing the storminland toward Nevada.Southern California has been drenched by a string of storms thatbegan in late December and have been only sporadically interrupted byclear skies.The current dousing, which began Thursday, has been the heaviest.On average, Los Angeles receives 18 inches of rain in the first sixmonths of each year, but more than 15 inches have fallen in the firstnine days of 2005.All across the Southland, residents dealt with rockslides, debrisflows, downed trees, power outages and mandatory evacuations, thoughthere were few serious injuries.Mudslides, a sinkhole and other water damage forced Metrolink andAmtrak to cancel some train routes serving Los Angeles and VenturaCounties on Monday.In Orange County, a combination of storm runoff and big surf causedhealth officials to close Corona del Mar State Beach in Newport Beachand Capistrano County Beach in Dana Point because of sewage pipeleaks.More than 300 miles away in the Eastern Sierra, skiers andsnowboarders glided atop 48 inches of snow that has fallen on MammothMountain since Friday. ``We've just been pounded,'' said Joani Lynch,a Mammoth Mountain spokeswoman. Some ski runs were closed at Big BearMountain Resorts because of heavy rains.In Los Angeles County, the Department of Water and Power reportedthousands of power outages in homes from Echo Park to Bel-Air. Arain-related accident on Mount Wilson tore down transmission lines,interrupting the broadcast of the Indianapolis Colts and DenverBroncos playoff game on KCBS for two hours.And in Arcadia, eight of nine horse races at Santa Anita Park werecanceled for the first time in 10 years because of rain. ``If it getsslippery, it could potentially be dangerous to horses, jockeys and allinvolved,'' said park spokesman Vince Bruun.Heavy rain fell in other parts of California, but the storms in theSouthland presented the biggest challenges.The 42-year-old homeless man who died in Elysian Park had beenliving with a younger acquaintance in a tent on top of a hill on the1700 block of Stadium Way, just north of the Pasadena Freeway.The man, identified as Jeffrey Lynn Earwood, was trapped underhundreds of pounds of thick mud, according to Los Angles City FireDepartment spokesman Brian Humphrey said. When rescue workers arrived,they said, only one of his limbs was visible. Humphrey saidfirefighters dug him out in less than 10 minutes, but he died at thescene.The other man, who was unidentified, received minor injuries.The victim in the Malibu traffic accident died after the SUV he wastraveling in skidded off the road in the 19700 block of PCH. LosAngeles County fire rescue workers recovered the man's body about 500feet from where the vehicle went into the water off Tuna Canyon Beach,said Lt. Randall Dickey of the Malibu Lost Hills Sheriff's Station.Four passengers in the car sustained minor injuries, Dickey said.Names and ages of the victims were not released.On Laurel Canyon Boulevard, three people were safe after their5,000-square-foot house collapsed, apparently the result of amudslide. An unidentified motorist helped the father pull his5-year-old daughter out of the rubble, authorities said. Firefightersrescued the man's 10-year-son. The family was hospitalized with minorinjuries.Humphrey said this was one of a number of areas where mudslidescaused problems. ``Choose your street with `Canyon' in the name, andthat likely has been impacted by mud.''Around 4 p.m., ``tons of mud'' from a hillside slid into the thirdfloor of a home in Silver Lake, , trapping a man inside, he said.Firefighters had to break a window in the home in the 1900 block ofNorth Lucile Avenue to reach the man, who was uninjured. The firedepartment also evacuated three other nearby homes.In Tujunga, five people were evacuated from the 6200 block of GyralDrive after a mudslide near the Angeles National Forest, Humphreysaid. No one was injured, though one house was damaged. People in 15houses farther down the street were advised to leave.Humphrey estimated that more than 100 roads in Los Angeles had seenflooding or mudslides or downed trees. ``Most of the incidents areminor, and people do their civic duty with shovels in the mud.''Times staff writers Nancy Cleeland, Erika Hayasaki, DanielHernandez, Fred Alvarez, David Reyes, Seema Mehta, Jennifer Mena,Terril Jones, Eric Bailey and Eric Slater contributed to this story.
Super-saturated land tumbled down a mountain Monday in the coastalcommunity of La Conchita, Calif., killing at least one person andinjuring many more, fire officials said.``We have one dead and numerous injuries,'' said Myrna Raya, fireinformation officer for the Ventura County Fire Department.Rescuers were searching through the mud for survivors, she said. Itwas unknown how many people were trapped; at least six people weretaken to area hospitals.The death brought to 10 the number of people killed in SouthernCalifornia during the past weekend's storm, one of three bringingrecord precipitation across the state.Mike and Barbara Bell, residents of La Conchita since 1983, saidthe landslide struck without warning about 1:15 p.m. PST. The Bells,who live on a street away from the slide, said they were cleaning upmud when they heard the slide.``We were standing on the street and just talking and somebodysaid, `Oh my God!' and then the hill came down,'' Mike Bell said. ``Itcovered the same three or four houses it hit the first time, then cameacross the street and hit six or seven more houses. It clearlydestroyed them. It just blew them apart.''Now I've got to get a backhoe and try to save my own house. Themudslide's at the other end of the street, but every time we get atorrential rain the mud flow comes right down my street. I've got togo if I'm going to save my house,`` he said.Kathleen Wood, who has lived in the community since 1985, wastaking a walk with a friend through La Conchita when the slideoccurred. ''I looked up and saw a cloud of dust. It was silent andthen it really came down. It snapped the retaining wall,`` she said.(Begin optional trim)Sam and Cynthia Ficklend, whose family had been going up to LaConchita on vacation for the last 50 years, moved to the seasidecommunity two years ago. They were going home to put things in cratesand boxes and looking for their cat.''We thought we'd retired to paradise,`` Cynthia Ficklend said.''Well, paradise is over.``(End optional trim)La Conchita is a small community fronted by U.S. 101, about 60miles north of downtown Los Angeles. It was also struck by a majorlandslide in 1995.The fifth day of thrashing storms took a heavy toll on SouthernCalifornia as the rain swelled streams and rivers and undermined theintegrity of the ground.(Begin optional trim)A slackening rainfall was expected to bring some relief for eveningcommuters, a step up from the morning drive, which was a treacherousgame of stop and go.Delays and some closures were reported on most major roads. Becausemany secondary roads were closed, traffic was forced onto thehighways, further clogging the principal routes. Where roads wereopen, sizable delays of more than an hour were reported in many areas.Schools in some parts of the region were forced to close for theday. Glendale Community College canceled evening classes because of anearby mudslide.(End optional trim)An estimated 6,000 customers in Los Angeles were reported withoutpower Monday afternoon.Earlier , Monday, the body of a 2-year-old girl was recovered inPalmdale, a high desert town in far northeastern Los Angeles County.The toddler plunged to her death after slipping from her mother'sgrasp as they were being lifted to safety by rescuers, who respondedwhen the family's vehicle became stuck in a flooded wash Sunday night.Authorities said the girl's mother, whose name was not released,drove around a barrier, one of several put up by county employees inthe area because of dangerously swirling creek waters caused by twoweeks of stormy weather.Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Michael Handley said cars areswept away all too often when people mistakenly think they can fordswollen waterways in the area. ''It happens all the time,`` he said.''I don't know what it is, the lemming mentality or something. They'reso intent on getting where they're going that they think they candrive through the flood waters.``Roads were clogged with rain and mud, and at least 720 crashes werereported Sunday, more than three times the number of accidents duringthe previous Sunday when streets were dry, the California HighwayPatrol said. Fire officials estimated that 100 roads in Los Angelessaw flooding, mudslides or downed trees.By Monday morning, the National Weather service reported thatdowntown Los Angeles received 5.16 inches since Friday and more than2.5 inches on Sunday alone. Beverly Hills received 7.79 inches, theL.A. community of Eagle Rock 3.8 inches, Santa Monica 4.7 inches, andChatsworth, in the San Fernando Valley, 5.81 inches.According to the weather service, Los Angeles has received almost21 inches of precipitation since July 1. That surpasses the averageannual rainfall of 15.14 inches with five months yet to go.The rain was expected to let up Monday afternoon, , but the regionwill have little time to dry out. Substantial rains were forecast forMonday night and through Tuesday. A real break was expected byWednesday, when clearing should take place for a few days at least.Times staff writers Jia-Rui Chong, Amanda Covarrubias, RichardFausset, Wendy Thermos and Michael Muskal contributed to this story.
Shippers scrambled for alternative routes Wednesday as UnionPacific Corp. struggled to overcome what it said was a ``probablyunprecedented'' disruption of service in Southern California becauseof the recent rains.Mother Nature might be to blame for Union Pacific's latest woes,but the recurring problems the railroad has had moving goods in andout of the region, coupled with recent backlogs at local ports, couldthreaten the economy, shipping experts and economists said.``If I'm a shipper, I'm starting to get disturbed about being ableto use Southern California as a base to get stuff into the country andout to my stores,'' said John Husing, an independent economist inRedlands, Calif.Citing mudslides and washed-out tracks and bridges, Union Pacificclosed four of its five main rail lines out of the Los Angeles Basin.That brought the railroad's freight traffic in the region to a nearstandstill. The company said it was racing to make track repairs andhoped to resume limited service on Thursday.Union Pacific's troubles included 23 mudslides that covered tracksin the Cajon Pass east of Los Angeles, a key passageway from SouthernCalifornia to Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, and eventually to theMidwest.``We have been told that the route from Los Angeles to Chicago haseffectively been closed,'' said Scott Dailey, a spokesman for APL, aleading shipper of intermodal cargo containers and a unit of NeptuneOrient Lines of Singapore.The fresh disruption -- coming on top of last year's gridlock atlocal ports and railways -- persuaded APL to decide to permanentlysend ``a lot of our transcontinental cargo'' to Seattle rather thanLos Angeles, he said. ``That is a major shift.''Decisions like that and Union Pacific's not-infrequentdifficulties, in addition to bottlenecks at the ports, ``certainlyshould cause people to think about the whole infrastructure'' inSouthern California, said Jim McKenna, president of the PacificMaritime Association, which represents West Coast shipping lines.Husing said the ``real damage is the continuing problems we have,whether it's 93 ships tied up off the coast or Union Pacific not beingable to get its cargo through the area.''Union Pacific, which was suffering major congestion problems on itstracks before the heavy rainfall, is the nation's largest railroad,with 33,000 miles of track from the West to the Midwest.Based in Omaha, Neb., it is one of two railroads that ferry goodsfrom the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach -- the world's busiestport complex -- north and east to the rest of the country. The otheris Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp.About half of the raw materials and finished goods that arrive atthe Los Angeles and Long Beach ports, mostly from Asia, aretransported by truck to destinations in Southern California. The restis forwarded nationwide by rail, with Union Pacific and BurlingtonNorthern each handling about half of that freight.Burlington Northern suffered no major setbacks from the storms, aspokesman said, and is carrying some freight for Union Pacific.Some analysts wondered why the nasty weather affected Union Pacificand not Burlington Northern. In the Cajon Pass, for instance, therailroads' tracks nearly parallel each other west of Interstate 15.But Union Pacific tracks are higher in elevation than BurlingtonNorthern's are, Union Pacific spokesman John Bromley said, and thuswere first to be hit by mudslides. The damage was even morepronounced, Bromley said, because ``the slides have occurred in areaswhere we've had all the forest fires and the ground cover was burnedoff.''Union Pacific's stock fell 38 cents Wednesday to $63.96 on the NewYork Stock Exchange.Times staff writers Debora Vrana and Evelyn Iritani contributed tothis report.
Los Angeles will get a much-needed break earlyMonday from the unforgiving rain that has pounded Southern Californiasince Thursday, but a new front will move in Mondaynight, bringing with it an additional 2 inches to 4inches of rain.It will be the last storm at least for a whileand forecasters say Southern Californians will see sunshine Tuesday, endinga wave of storms. The latest storm wave on Sundayalone dumped 4 1/2 inches of rain downtown, 6 inchesin Burbank and Chatsworth, 3.29 inches in Woodland Hills andnearly 8 inches in Beverly Hills.""We'll begin to see some normalcy come back on Tuesday, butit's still winter,"" said National Weather Service meteorologist Bill Hoffer.""We should see clear to partly cloudy skies from Tuesdayall the way out to Saturday.""While there might be blue skies on the horizon, the relentlessstorm system that has hovered over Southern California since Thursdaycaused massive flooding, mudslides, power outages, several evacuations, school closuresand disrupted commuter rail service.The heavy rainfall is being attributed to a sluggish, low-pressure systemthat collided with a stream of tropical moisture from thesouthern Pacific known as a ""Pineapple Express.""On the third consecutive day of heavy downpours Sunday, the skiesdumped up to 2 inches of rain an hour insome areas -- turning some streets in hillside communities intoraging rivers and stranding dozens of motorists who had tobe rescued by overtaxed emergency workers.At Sun Valley's infamous intersection -- San Fernando Road and TuxfordStreet -- a swift-water rescue team plucked 20-year-old Amber Pittsfrom her car after she became stuck in as muchas 4 feet of water at about 6 p.m.""It was the fourth rescue we have made at that intersection(Sunday). Luckily, she was OK,"" said Los Angeles Fire Departmentspokesman Brian Humphrey. ""That intersection is always flooded when itrains, and some people decide to try to make itthrough.""In the Ventura County community of Bardsdale, just south of Fillmore,resident Doug Bofolo and his family had to evacuate theirhouse just east of Highway 23 when a massive waterflow overtook his property.""The water was chest-deep. Everything was floating,"" Bofolo said. ""We've gota 5-foot block wall and we can't even see thetop of it. This is even worse than the floodingwe got in 1969.""In Santa Clarita, residents of the Polynesian Mobile Home Park atSan Fernando Road and Sierra Highway were evacuated when saturatedhillsides and roadbeds gave way to the nonstop flooding.Thirty engine companies, the Urban Search and Rescue teams and countylifeguards were deployed with more than 200 firefighters responding.""The whole (Santa Clarita) valley (was) on alert,"" Los Angeles CountyFire Department Capt. Dave Peterson said during Sunday's deluge.The Fire Department reported flooding as high as second-story windows atcabins along Bouquet Canyon in the Angeles National Forest. Bymidafternoon, department resources were stretched thin and there was notmuch more that could be done to hold back mudslides.Flooding was reported at Bouquet Canyon Road and Vasquez Canyon Road,causing a road closure.In Saugus, firefighters led a dozen people to high ground afterthey were stranded on San Francisquito Canyon Road by floodingand mudslides from the rain-swelled San Francisquito Creek.Four adults and eight children were rescued by helicopter and takento safety at a church at the mouth of SanFrancisquito Canyon.Gary Brynjegard and sons Peter, 16, and Garrison, 13, of Castaichad headed into the canyon earlier to survey damage. Brynjegardworks for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power,which operates two plants along winding, two-lane San Francisquito CanyonRoad just north of Santa Clarita.""We drove up to look around, then saw a mudslide andI said, We better get out of here,"" Brynjegard said.""We ran like crazy; the mountains were sliding down aroundus.""In Fillmore, 145 people had to be evacuated from the ElDorado Mobile Home Park, where floodwaters began breaching their homes.A mudslide closed Highway 126 between Fillmore and Piru, and Highway23 between Fillmore and Moorpark was closed by a massivewater flow that was a quarter-mile wide.Emergency notifications in Ventura County indicated that all schools in theFillmore Unified School District would be closed Monday, and Metrolinksaid its Ventura County line will be closed Monday becauseof flooding and mudslides.Metrolink said its trains will not be operating from stations atCamarillo, Oxnard or Montalvo. Passengers are being asked to goto the Oxnard station, where buses will be provided totake them to Moorpark station.In Ventura, fire crews rescued six residents of the evacuated EmmaWood State Beach RV park who were trapped on arock on the Santa Clara River bottom near the WestMain Street Bridge on Sunday morning.Elsewhere in Ventura County, Sheriff's Department officials reported flooding in theArroyo Vista Mobile Home Park in Moorpark, where residents wereevacuated.Late Saturday, a man drowned after being washed away by aswollen river north of Ojai in Ventura County, officials said.Sunday was a long day for L.A. city and county firefighters,who responded to numerous mudslides, collapses and rescues.A mudslide in Elysian Park buried a makeshift homeless encampment, killingone man and injuring another while they slept in atent. One person died and four people were hurt ina single-car crash on Pacific Coast Highway near Malibu.A two-story home collapsed in the Studio City area above theSan Fernando Valley, and a 33-year-old man and his twochildren were pulled from the rubble with minor injuries. Fireofficials said the house rolled down the hill and collapsedinto a pile of debris in a matter of seconds.The rain caused a hillside to give way in the 6200block of Gyral Drive in Sunland, damaging a home andprompting authorities to evacuate five people from three residences, Humphreysaid.And in Los Feliz, a man was rescued from a three-storyhome built into a hillside in the 1900 block ofLucille Drive when a mudslide overran the patio and flowedinto the house.The roads in Los Angeles County were equally frustrating. Dozens ofroads and highways were closed throughout the day. Authorities reportedscores of traffic crashes and ordered scattered road closings, includingthe southbound side of Interstate 5 at the Pasadena Freewaybecause of a mudslide.In Malibu, a rain-related, single-vehicle crash in the 19700 block ofPacific Coast Highway left a man dead and four otherpeople injured just before 8 a.m. The vehicle ended upin the ocean, said sheriff's Lt. Randall Dickey of theMalibu-Lost Hills station. The conditions of the four other peoplewere not immediately known.The storm drew a number of curious Southlanders out to hard-hitcanyon areas, further complicating the work of firefighters and otherrescue workers. Humphrey urged people to stay off the roadsif they can over the next day or two ofwet weather.""Many people have been found sightseeing,"" which Humphrey said was ""hamperingthe efforts of emergency officials.""As many as 12,000 DWP customers lost power Sunday morning. PacificGas & Electric spokesman David Eisenhauer said 11,000 customers remainedwithout power, scattered throughout the company's service area. Southern CaliforniaEdison, which has 4.6 million customers in a 50,000-square-mile servicearea in five counties, reported only minor power outages.Several Los Angeles-area radio stations were knocked off the air forhours Sunday after trouble with transmitters on Mount Wilson, whichwas assumed to be related to the stormy weather.Monday, Topanga Elementary School at 141 N.

Parentsseeking more information should contact the school or its Website.The storm wreaked havoc in Northern California and Nevada as well,piling snow deeper across the Sierra Nevada, stranding an Amtraktrain, knocking out service at the Reno airport and shuttingdown major highways across the mountains.Forecasters called the series of storms the snowiest in the Reno-LakeTahoe area since 1916.""I've lived here for almost 40 years and I've never seenanything like it,"" Peter Walenta, 69, of Stateline said Sunday.An avalanche knocked a 13-year-old boy from a ski lift atthe Las Vegas Ski & Snowboard Resort, 45 miles northwestof Las Vegas, said Clark County fire spokesman Bob Leinbach.Forecasters extended a winter storm warning into Tuesday across the Sierraand parts of northern Nevada, where as much as 2more feet of snow was expected. The latest storm hadleft up to 6 1/2 feet of snow in theSierra and 2 1/2 feet in the Reno area.Carol Rock, Patricia Farrell Aidem and wire services contributed to thisreport.

Rescue workers using sensitive listening devices andcadaver dogs probed for buried victims on Tuesday in a25-foot-deep mountain of mud and debris left by Monday's mudslideas the rains finally ended and desperate family members keptvigil.Bob Roper, the Ventura County fire chief, said Tuesday afternoon thatmonitoring equipment was still picking up faint sounds of lifefrom the debris pile, raising the possibility of survivors.""We're looking for any movement,"" Capt.

""He ran up there and started digging withhis hands. He was yelling, 'I have to get mykids! My kids!""'Rescuers pulled three more bodies from the mud on Tuesday, bringingthe official death count to six.The collapse of the hillside here was a deadly coda tofive days of merciless rains across Southern California that haveleft 20 dead and driven thousands from their homes underthreat of floods and mudslides.Even as skies cleared on Tuesday, 4,000 people were evacuated fromthe banks of a surging creek in the Orange Countycommunities of San Juan Capistrano and Dana Point. And ahiker who had been trapped for three days in acave by raging floodwaters in the San Bernardino Mountains wasrescued by helicopter.Among the dead across the region were a man whose bodywas found wedged in a tree in a canyon, awoman who was run over by her husband, who couldnot see her in the driving rain, and an 18-year-oldwoman who was killed when her car hit a fallentree. Here in La Conchita, where as many as 12people were missing, 14 people were also injured, two ofthem critically, and roughly half of the town's houses weredestroyed or badly damaged. Dozens of roads around the arearemained closed because of mud or deep standing water.
The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Jan.12:Here we are, three weeks into winter, and the season hasdelivered almost every kind of weather it has to deliver:waterspouts off Ventura, Calif., ice storms in the central Plains,glacial fog in the Texas Panhandle, profound depths of snowin the Sierra Nevada, flooding in the Ohio Valley andan all too familiar mix of ice, snow and rainin the Northeast.Nowhere has winter been more impressive this year than in SouthernCalifornia. Los Angeles has already had some 5 inches morethan its annual rainfall in the last two weeks, includinga record 2.6 inches on Sunday. The numbers do notreally convey the effect of all that water, combined withpowerful storm surges along the coast. Mudslides have closed freewaysand caused evacuations and some deaths. Every creek and river-- dry streambeds for most of the year -- hasswollen to a dangerous tide of dark water. Vast stretchesof the Mojave Desert have been inundated by the unstintingrain. In the Central Valley, water stands in the fields,washing out the hope of some crops. In Bakersfield, whichaverages less than 6 inches of rainfall a year, therain fell in sheets on Sunday and Monday, turning highwaysinto long columns of vehicle-beaten spray.There is temporary respite coming. Good weather will hit Southern Californialater this week, and the Northeast has enjoyed some mildintervals. And this much moisture in the arid West alwayspromises good news, despite the chaotic way it has come.But no matter how good the weather gets for afew days in mid-January, the bulk of winter lies ahead.It's hard to imagine what it may bring.
","In January 2005, rescue workers in southern California used snowplows, snowcats and snowmobiles to free people from a highway where snow, sleet, rain and fog caused a 200-vehicle logjam. A fourth day of storms took a heavy toll as saturated hillsides gave way, mudslides inundating houses and closing highways. People fled neighborhoods up and down the coast. Eight of nine horse races at Santa Anita were canceled for the first time in 10 years. More than 6,000 houses were without power in Los Angeles. A scientist said Los Angeles had not seen such intensity of winter downpours since 1889-90. ","Southern California was drenched by rainstorms in January 2005. Los Angeles had 15 inches in the first nine days. The rains caused severe flooding, sinkholes and mudslides resulting in huge property losses, blocked roads, power outages, hundreds of auto accidents, interruptions of rail traffic, and, by Jan. 10th, twenty deaths. Heroic efforts by hundreds of overtaxed rescue workers saved thousands from collapsed houses, mud piles and floodwaters. Sensitive listening devices and cadaver dogs searched for signs of life in mountains of mud and debris. By Jan 12th good weather was forecast for later in the week. ","Record-breaking rains brought danger and destruction to southern California in the first weeks of 2005. The early January storms dropped more rain in Los Angeles than its average annual amount. Several thousand residents endured power outages. Conditions necessitated widespread evacuations. Landslides, mudslides, floods and downed trees caused massive destruction of homes and roads. Stranded motorists required rescue by overtaxed emergency workers. Schools, businesses, rail lines and roads were closed. Beaches were closed for sewage leaks. The number of traffic accidents tripled from the previous dry weekend. In all, the storms caused at least 20 deaths and dozens of injuries. ","Southern California was been drenched by storms beginning in late December 2004, the heaviest drenching in nearly 40 years. Over 15 inches fell during the first nine days of January. The storm resulted in human deaths and injuries. It created flooding, mudslides, and rockslides which caused power outages, evacuations, and disruption of rail services. Beaches, state parks and some mountain and ski resorts were closed. The National Weather Service said this system occurs only every 5-10 years. The extraordinary weather was attributed to a confluence of tropical air from the South Pacific and a cold front from the North. "
D0906,D0906-B,"Multi-million-dollar homes collapsed and mudslides trapped residents in their homes on Monday as a heavy rains that have claimed three lives pelted Los Angeles for the fifth straight day.Scores of people were evacuated from their homes as severe flooding overtook suburbs of the second-largest US city, including the chic district of Bel Air where three luxury homes slid down a hillside.The swimming pool of one of the homes dramatically gave way, live on local television, and tumbled down a slope after their residents were evacuated.As hailstones hit central Los Angeles, parts of nearby cities of Hunting Beach, Long Beach and Glendale were turned into lakes, leaving homes drenched and caked in layers of mud as a monster storm system hammered usually-parched southern California, wreaking havoc across the region.Three deaths have been blamed on the storms that have dumped but more than 19.5 centimeters (6.5 inches) on downtown Los Angeles between Thursday night and Monday morning.A 16-year-old girl died late Sunday when a boulder toppled down a hillside and crashed her family's apartment in the remote Silverado Canyon area of the city.In addition, a city public works employee also died Sunday when he fell into a nine-meter- (30-foot-) deep sinkhole that developed earlier in a road in the when in the area of Sun Valley.And on Monday, a 63-year-old man died when he was buried in about 1.2 meters (four feet) of mud that slid into his home in the Woodland Hills area of the Los Angeles, said Melissa Kelley of the Los Angeles Fire Department. Firefighters used heat-sensing equipment to find the body, she said. A woman sleeping in another room was uninjured.In an area known as Hacienda Heights, a mudslide trapped at least three people in an apartment block that was inundated by 10 feet of mud. One woman escaped on her own, but firefighters had to pull two others from the mess.Residents of a mobile home park in the area of Newhall were awash after a creek overflowed drenching their trailers and belongings.Some 94 centimeters (31.36 inches) of rain have fallen this winter, making it the wettest to hit Los Angeles in 22 years and the fifth wettest since the 1883-1884 season, when 38.18 inches fell, meteorologists said. 
With the search for victims of a deadly mudslide over, some residents of thisoceanfront town prepared to return to their homes despite being warned of thedanger of another collapse.""There's no place you can live in the world without danger,"" said Mike Bell, 57.""It's no greater danger than anywhere else.""The death toll stood at 10 in the beach community devastated by Monday's torrentof dirt and trees, and everyone on the list of missing people had been located.Thirteen homes were destroyed and 18 others were damaged.The entire town of about 260 people was evacuated Monday. But Ventura CountySheriff Bob Brooks said Thursday that officials have no authority to stop peoplefrom returning if their homes have been determined safe.Authorities planned to meet with residents Friday to discuss a specific plan fortheir return.""Now it's time to rebuild the community, and that's what we're here to do,"" saidVentura County Fire Chief Bob Roper.Still, if they had their way, Roper and Brooks said people would never return tothe beachfront town situated at the base of towering cliffs that have collapsedtwice in 10 years following heavy rains.""We believe that the La Conchita community is a geologically hazardous area,""Brooks said Thursday. ""It has been historically, it is today, and it will remainso. We do not recommend that people return to this area or the people who stayhere remain here.""The warning was enough for West Aycock, who said he is not willing to risk hisinfant son's life.""I don't want him there,"" said Aycock, 23. ""He's too little. He's all I careabout. I don't know what's going to happen with the mountain anymore. I don'tknow if it's going to come down or what.""Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger visited La Conchita, and has declared a stateemergency. Rescue workers stopped digging on Thursday after authoritiesdetermined everyone on a list of missing people had been located.The mudslides were just one facet of the deadly storms that pummeled Californiathis month. Including the 10 mudslide victims, 28 people died in Californiaduring five days of constant, torrential rain that ended Tuesday.The storms may cost the state more than $100 million (euro75 million) in damageto homes, roads and farms, according to initial estimates from state officialsand farm and insurance groups.
Californians braced for even more rain as they struggled to recover from stormsthat have left at least nine people dead, triggered mudslides and tornadoes, andwashed away roads and runways.Among the victims was a Nevada woman caught in an avalanche while cross-countryskiing near Lake Tahoe, and a 16-year-old Orange County girl doing homework on acomputer when a mudslide crashed through the wall of her home.In Ventura County, officials closed the small Santa Paula airport Tuesday aftermore than 155 feet (46.5 meters) of runway collapsed into the rushing SantaClara River. Chunks of concrete crumbled into the water throughout theday.""We've lost nearly the entire west third of the airport,"" said Rowena Mason,president of the Santa Paula Airport Association. ""This is millions and millionsof dollars worth of damage.""Rescues occurred across the state, including a woman who was pulled Tuesday fromrushing, waist-high waters of the Rio Hondo River in Montebello.Forecasters said another strong system expected early Wednesday could bringsevere winds and drop an additional inch or more of rain on SouthernCalifornia.Despite brief glimpses of sun, a flash flood watch was in effect across much ofSouthern California on Tuesday. A tornado warning was also issued for coastalareas.Authorities said dozens of homes were evacuated or red-tagged _ marked asuninhabitable _ because they threatened to collapse from slidinghillsides.Mudslides forced Amtrak officials to suspend train service north of Los Angelesto Santa Barbara at least through Thursday.The wild weather came from a series of storms that began battering the state onThursday, dumping 8.15 inches (20.7 centimeters) of rain on downtown LosAngeles.A total of 33.09 inches ( 84.05 centimeters) of rain has fallen in the citysince July 1, when California begins its yearly rainfall measurements. Therecord, 38.18 inches (96.98 centimeters), was set in 1883-1884.Storms have caused $52.5 million (euro39.8 million) in damage to Los AngelesCounty roads and facilities since the beginning of the year. The county hasspent $9 million (euro6.8 million) on repairs, including $500,000 (euro378,989)since the weekend, officials said.Mayor James Hahn asked Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to urge President George W.Bush to issue a federal disaster declaration for the city, which could open theway for federal assistance. The mayor said damage exceeded $10 million (euro7.84million).Northern California also was hit by severe thunderstorms and hail. Trees wereuprooted and roofs and fences damaged by two small tornadoes nearSacramento.Rain in Northern California tapered off Tuesday, with only isolated showersexpected by Wednesday, said Bob Benjamin, a NWS forecaster.
The sun began poking through the clouds as California emergency crews shiftedinto cleanup mode after a six-day drenching that killed at least nine people,destroyed dozens of houses and flooded roads and airports.The Transportation Department hurried Wednesday to clear at least 20 major roadsclosed by mudslides and flooding, and in Malibu, crews prepared to destroy aboulder the size of a house that dangled precariously above the Pacific CoastHighway, held back by only a retaining wall. Crews also worked to fill thousandsof potholes _ some the size of cars.Engineers fanned out across Los Angeles to assess whether houses on slippingsoil were still habitable. More than 100 homes were temporarily uninhabitable orsafe only for limited entry.Los Angeles city fire spokesman Brian Humphrey said some ambulance crews hadbeen diverted to work as reconnaissance teams to spot signs of flooding andmudslides.Firefighters, meanwhile, were working 24-hour shifts with little time to eat oreven use the restroom. On Monday, the heaviest day of rain, the departmentreceived nearly 2,000 calls _ twice the normal amount, Humphreysaid.Rain fell early in the day Wednesday across part of Southern California but wasexpected to taper off as the storm's center headed east along theCalifornia-Mexico border.The storms began last Thursday, bringing 9.14 inches (23.22 centimeters) byWednesday morning to a city where the average for an entire year is about 15inches (38.1 centimeters). Damage in Los Angeles County alone since Jan. 1 wasestimated at $52.5 million (euro39.76 million), including up to $10 million(euro7.57 million) in damage caused by the latest storm.In Ventura County, the small Santa Paula airport remained closed after more than155 feet (46.5 meters) of runway crumbled into the rushing Santa Clara River.Mudslides forced Amtrak to suspend train service between Los Angeles and SantaBarbara through at least Thursday.Among those killed were a man who was driving when a eucalyptus tree fell on hispickup truck in San Diego County and a 16-year-old girl who was doing homeworkin an apartment bedroom when boulders hit her home near Irvine.Rainfall since July 1, when California begins its yearly rainfall measurements,now totals 34.36 inches (87.27 centimeters) _ more than Seattle or Portland andthe most in Los Angeles since 1889-90. The record for a single year _ 38.18inches (96.98 centimeters) _ was set in 1883-84.South of the border in Tijuana, Mexico, authorities reported at least sevenhomes had collapsed in landslides and more than 150 people wereevacuated.___Associated Press Writer Ryan Pearson contributed to this report.
It's looking like a crazy year for weather, and January isn't overyet. Already we've seen record rains in California, floods in theMidwest and snow in south Texas. Has Mother Nature gone bonkers?Maybe just a little. The weather definitely has been wild lately:-- Seventeen inches of rain fell on Los Angeles in 15 days from Dec.27 to Jan. 10. That's two inches more than the city averages for anentire year. The heavy rains softened the ground and caused mudslidesthat killed people and destroyed homes.-- Can you imagine if all that rain had been snow? Folks in theSierra Nevada mountains can. The same storms that produced so muchrain in the valleys of Southern California dumped 19 feet of snow inthe mountains to the north. That's 228 inches!-- Brownsville, Texas, recorded 1.5 inches of snow on Christmas Day.It was the first measurable snow there since 1895, and might have beenthe town's first-ever White Christmas. Snow is so rare there that aBrownsville snowball sold for $92 on eBay.-- More than nine inches of precipitation has fallen in Indianapolissince the beginning of the year. Normally, the Indiana city would haveless than two inches by this time in January. Large amounts of rainand snow have caused rivers all over the Midwest to spill over theirbanks and flood homes.-- Temperatures have been wacky, too. Last week the mercury droppedto 54 degrees below zero in Minnesota. The state record is 60 below.Here in Washington we were having a mild, snowless winter -- the hightemperature reached 64 degrees or higher five times in the first halfof January. Now, it's freezing outside and we've had snow three timesin one week.So, what's going on? Is it global warming? Is El Nino to blame?While scientists believe that global warming -- the slow increase inEarth's overall temperature -- could result in more extreme weather,there's no way to be sure it has anything to do with what has happenedin the last several weeks.Crazy weather is often blamed on El Nino, the warming of waters inthe eastern Pacific Ocean that affects weather patterns all over theworld. But the current El Nino is pretty weak and probably isn'tresponsible for the wicked weather we've seen this year.Instead, forecasters have traced some of the unusual activity,especially the storms out West, to another phenomenon in the PacificOcean. This one is called the Madden-Julian Oscillation, or MJO.Discovered by scientists Roland Madden and Paul Julian, the MJO causesan increase in tropical rainfall and thunderstorms, which in turnaffects weather in the United States and around the globe.It's also important to remember that the weather is rarely``normal'' anyway. Temperatures and precipitation tend to go throughcycles. Just as sports teams have winning and losing streaks, theweather has warm and cool streaks, and wet and dry streaks.That's part of what makes our planet so exciting. You never knowexactly how long a cold spell or heat wave will last, or how much rainor snow is on the way.Makes you wonder what kind of wild weather tomorrow will bring.
Southern California's six-day siege of torrentialrains finally came to an end Wednesday, leaving scores of roadsblocked by mudslides and washouts, dozens of homes uninhabitable and amassive cleanup job that could last for weeks.Traffic on more than 100 roads in Los Angeles County was blocked orinterrupted by the storms, and public works officials said highwaydamage was so widespread that some roads might not reopen until summeror even fall.The Los Angeles City Council transferred $500,000 from its reservefund to provide loans and grants for residents displaced by damage, orthe threat of it, to their homes.Parting showers raised the rainfall total for the season indowntown Los Angeles to 33.87 inches Wednesday, making it the thirdwettest season on record and the rainiest in 115 years.Typically, almost 5 inches of rain falls on the city between nowand June 30, when the season ends. That means there's a better thaneven chance that by the time this season is over, it will be thewettest ever, surpassing the record of 38.18 inches in 1883-84. Justthree years ago, the 2001-02 season was the driest ever, with only4.42 inches.Despite at least five storm-related deaths and damage that couldtop $100 million, the rain did some good, too. Southern California'sstorage reservoirs and underground aquifers are once again full,meaning there will be less reliance on water from distant sources suchas the Colorado Basin, which is still in the throes of a long-termdrought.Dry weather is expected for the remainder of this week, but theNational Weather Service said there's a chance of light rain Sunday,Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.The county and city departments of public works and the CaliforniaDepartment of Transportation face a monumental task of cleaning up themess created by the storms. The cost of repairing roads has climbed to$37.6 million for the county alone.Major routes that remained blocked Wednesday included Pacific CoastHighway in Malibu, the Angeles Crest Highway above La CanadaFlintridge, state Highway 39 above Azusa, Bouquet Canyon road aboveNewhall, Topanga Canyon Boulevard near Fernwood, the Sierra Highwaybetween Palmdale and La Canada Flintridge and Malibu Canyon Road aboveMalibu.The storm damage included bridge failures, flooding, pavementbreakup, rock slides, failed retaining walls and erosion.On Malibu Canyon Road, firefighters used their hoses to try toclear a tall pile of fallen rocks, taking time out to pull out a horsethat got stuck chest-deep in mud. The hoses weren't powerful enough towash away the slide, and officials said they would try explosives onThursday.Other major routes that remain closed by slides, washouts or bridgefailures include parts of Mulholland Drive and a stretch of StadiumWay between Elysian Park and Chavez Ravine, near Dodger Stadium.City officials said more than 2,000 potholes had been repairedsince Friday, with hundreds more to go.Sixteen more homes werered-tagged in the Glassell Park neighborhood, raising the total markedunfit for habitation in the city of Los Angeles to at least 43.Another 70 homes in the city had been marked with yellow tags,indicating that access was allowed only during daytime hours.In Pasadena, six houses were red-tagged in the San Rafael District.In Orange County, three homes had been destroyed by slides and 13more were threatened.Times staff writers Jessica Garrison, Lisa Richardson, LancePugmire and Mai Tran contributed to this story.
In scenes reminiscent of the aftermath of the Northridge Earthquake 11years ago this month, Los Angeles area residents faced gridlockedfreeways and roads Wednesday while cleanup crews cleared mud, rubbleand debris left from a two-week siege of rain.On a brilliantly sunny day, it was a nightmare getting towork and schools or even running routine errands.The San Fernando Valley was especially hard hit, with morning trafficbacked up for miles on the Ventura and San Diegofreeways as canyon cut-throughs to the Westside remained shut down.The evening commute was just as bad.""The 405, a parking lot,"" said CHP Officer Tariq Johnson. ""Rightnow ... there's quite a few closures still in effect.""Countless streets across Los Angeles County remained closed by flooding andmud as crews worked to dig out the debris.""This is certainly a significant event. ... The road closures havemade it hard for some people to travel to work,to get around and do their normal daily routines,"" saidKen Pellman, spokesman for the county's Public Works Department. ""Inthat way it's been disruptive much the same way theearthquake was in '94.The California Highway Patrol reported back-ups on the eastbound Ventura Freewaythat stretched nearly to Ventura County during the morning rush.""The 101-405 interchange was very, very busy,"" said CHP West Valleyspokesman Officer Leland Tang.""I think what happened was ... all the connectors to theWestside -- the canyon connectors Laurel Canyon, Coldwater Canyon (wereclosed). Beverly Glen was overflooded with traffic. Sepulveda Boulevard hadtraffic as well.""Everyone got frustrated with those two alternates and went over tothe freeway.""The city reopened Laurel Canyon and Coldwater Canyon boulevards during theevening commute, but at reduced speeds of 10 mph amidrisks of falling rocks.Caltrans hoped to get Topanga Canyon Boulevard opened sometime today afterblowing up a giant boulder and hauling it away inpieces.But huge headaches remain with the 101 Freeway still shut downat the site of the deadly La Conchita mudslide betweenVentura and Santa Barbara. The only alternative requires a four-hourdetour.Caltrans hopes to reopen the highway by Friday.""We have crews working around the clock, working shoulder to shoulderwith the fire department and the California Highway Patrol,"" saidCaltrans spokeswoman Jeanne Bonfilio.""We're very hopeful that once 101 reopens ... that will helpcommuters.""Even more, the southbound Golden State Freeway was shut down Wednesdaymorning to one lane at Templin Highway because of pavementdamage, jamming the main artery coming into Los Angeles County.It's unclear when the 5 will get back to normal.""It certainly is a major north-south artery. We're going to beworking very hard to get that open as soon aspossible as well,"" Bonfilio said.The region has been hammered by the 15 wettest days onrecord after a series of cold storms beginning after Christmasunleashed a fury on Southern California.The beating has left dozens of streets impassable by floods, mudslidesand debris, while others are rough riding with countless potholes.Road repairs will cost the region millions.So far, Caltrans estimates it's spending $11 million just on immediaterepairs, while the county said it will spend $40 millionon roads and other public works repairs.The city of Los Angeles estimates $10 million in public andprivate losses, but could not break out road repair costsseparately.""There's certainly work to do,"" said Caltrans' Bonfilio. ""When you considerthe hundreds and hundreds of miles of freeways, and themillions of miles that are traveled on these freeways ona daily basis, our freeways held up.""Experts said the problem Wednesday was a triple-whammy of people gettingback to their routines, roads still closed and thousands ofLos Angeles Unified School District students back from holiday breakthis week.The CHP had urged motorists to stay home during the rains.""Now that it's stopped raining, people are coming out again. That'sfor sure a big impact,"" said CHP spokeswoman Officer RebeccaEstrada.""We did notice that when it was raining toward this lastweek people were adhering to what we were saying. ...There weren't as many people out there, as opposed tonow, when it isn't raining; traffic is (back) to itsnormal go, as to congestion.""'The CHP logged 292 incidents from 5 a.m. to noon oncounty freeways, compared with 246 the previous Wednesday.Transit service, too, has suffered setbacks. Amtrak has halted its PacificSurfliner route between San Diego and San Luis Obispo becauseof mudslides in Orange County and a sinkhole and rocksnear Santa Barbara.Metrolink had to shut down three stations in Ventura County wheretracks are washed out by the rains, busing passengers tothe station in Moorpark.Still, Metrolink spokeswoman Denise Tyrrell said, ridership numbers are up.""We are able to move people faster than the freeways whenthere's this poor weather. That gives you some idea howbad those highways are.""Some said while the destruction wasn't as obvious as the fallenfreeways after the Jan. 17, 1994, Northridge Quake, the numberof closures across the region had a somewhat similar impacton commutes.Many roads will remain shut down for some time.Across Ventura County, main routes between communities are closed, with reopendates set for weeks from now.Similarly, Los Angeles County's main mountain cut-through, State Route 2, isshut down at Angeles Crest Highway, as are other routesin the San Gabriel Valley.County public works crews were getting roads blocked by mudslide anddebris reopened ""by the hour,"" Pellman said. But those withstructural damage will take longer to repair.""(The closures are) not going to last months -- there mightbe a few because of structural reasons. The vast majorityof the roads are going to be open in days.""Caltrans said it hoped to reopen connectors between the Long Beachand Santa Monica freeways today.John Sapone, the city's street services superintendent, said his office hasreceived more than 1,000 calls for pothole repairs -- fourtimes normal -- and that crews will work Saturday andSunday to get the job done.However, other street repairs such as washed-away gutters or alligator crackswill have to wait, and get in line on thecity's long list of needed street repairs.The city had 460 reports of trees or branches blocking roadsand was pumping sewage in Eagle Rock to keep itfrom overflowing into streets.""We're just asking them to be patient; we'll get to them,""said Linda Aparicio, a Department of Public Works spokeswoman. ""BySunday, everything should be looking really good.""
A winter storm pummeled Southern California on Mondayfor the third straight day, claiming the lives of threepeople and raising fears of mudslides -- even as homesaround the region were evacuated.The downpour is expected to drop up to 3 more inchesby Wednesday, making this the wettest year on record inLos Angeles through the end of February.Mudslides killed a 63-year-old man in Woodland Hills and a teenagerin Orange County, and forced the evacuation of homes inGlendale, Pasadena, Bel-Air and coastal La Conchita. A 47-year-old LosAngeles civil engineer died late Sunday when he fell intoa house-size sinkhole in Sun Valley.Across the Southland, freeways jammed. Commuter train service stalled. Wind andlightning knocked out power to thousands. Nickel-size hail fell ondowntown Los Angeles. And farmers, weary of near-record rains, worriedabout millions in potential crop damage.Residents, meanwhile, struggled to repair leaky roofs as retailers reported arun on rain gear, umbrellas and windshield wipers.""Enough already with the rain.

A record-shattering storm slammed Southern California for asixth straight day Tuesday, triggering mudslides and tornadoes and forcingmore road closures, but forecasters predicted it would wane Wednesdaybefore a new storm moves in Sunday night.Officials put the statewide death toll from the current storms atnine, while damage mounted into the tens of millions ofdollars. Six deaths were reported in Southern California, three inNorthern California.Still, there was hope for a reprieve today from what alreadyhas become the fourth-wettest year on record.""It is still spawning some showers and some thunderstorms, but it'snot going to be continuous rain for everyone, everywhere,"" saidJayme Laber, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service inOxnard. ""You might even see some blue skies.""Sagging, sodden hillsides collapsed throughout the city Tuesday, sending homes skiddingdown slopes and causing a swimming pool to slide intoa neighboring home in Bel-Air.Tuesday's damage toll added to the death and devastation seen earlierin the storm. Two men died in the San FernandoValley, including Rory Shaw, 47, a Los Angeles civil engineerwho died after being swept into sinkhole in Sun Valley,and Robert Wickham, 61, who died when a mudslide rippedinto the bedroom of his home in Woodland Hills.Other Southern California deaths include 16-year-old Caitlin Oto, who was killedin the rural Silverado Canyon area east of Irvine whenlarge boulders crashed into a wall as she did herhomework, and three others who died in traffic crashes inSan Bernardino and San Diego counties.The storm has brought more than 9 inches of rain toHansen Dam and Chatsworth Reservoir, exceeding the normal rainfall foran entire season. More than 8 inches of rain hasfallen in Van Nuys and downtown Los Angeles since Thursday.Between 16 inches and 21 inches of rain has fallenin the local foothills and mountains.In Ventura County, the flood-swollen Santa Clara River devoured part ofthe runway at Santa Paula Airport, adding to an estimated$5 million in damage suffered in the January storms.""It ate away a good portion of our airport,"" said PatQuinn, the airport's emergency director. ""We've lost about 200 feetof runway so far, and it's not the end ofthe runway, it's in the middle. We're in big troublehere.""Roads throughout Los Angeles and Ventura counties remained closed by mudslidesTuesday, and train service between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara,suspended by a mudslide in Moorpark, will not resume untilat least Thursday, Amtrak officials said.Storms have caused $52.5 million in damage to Los Angeles Countyroads and facilities since the beginning of the year, saidDonald Wolf, interim director of the Public Works Department.The county has spent $9 million on repairs, including $500,000 sincethe weekend, Wolf said.The storm has also stretched emergency workers nearly to the limit.""We've rescued a number of people from their cars because offlooding, we've dealt with trees down, we've dealt with high-tensionlines down, we've had to shut down gas lines, prettymuch everything you can imagine,"" said Jim Wells, a spokesmanfor the Los Angeles Fire Department.City inspectors have condemned 23 homes because of storm damage, and69 others have been yellow-tagged, meaning they can be occupiedonly during daytime hours, said Linda Aparicio, a spokeswoman forthe city's Public Works Department.Residents will have only the barest reprieve before a new stormsystem rolls into the region this weekend, Laber said. Anotherstorm is expected next week.More than 33 inches of rain has fallen in downtown LosAngeles since July 1, the fourth-wettest winter on record andjust over 5 inches shy of the record set inthe winter of 1883-84.""We're closing in on some all-time rainfall totals here,"" Laber said.""And we still have March.""Mayor James Hahn called on the state on Tuesday to extendthe state of emergency to help clean up.""A lot of people are going to be shocked to findout their insurance doesn't cover this damage,"" Hahn said. ""That'swhy it's important for us to extend the emergency periodto make funds available.""Hahn sent a letter to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to make thedeclaration, which is the first step in getting federal aidto the area.Hahn estimated the city has suffered an additional $10 million indamage from the past week of storms. Earlier storm damagewas estimated at some $80 million.Hahn toured several areas of the city hardest hit by thestorms and noted it caused so much damage to someareas that homeowners might not be able to rebuild.The yawning sinkhole on Tujunga Avenue in Sun Valley that beganas a pothole grew to a 150-foot-diameter, 30-foot-deep crater Tuesday,and it was unclear when city officials would be ableto begin repairs.City Public Works spokeswoman Cora Jackson Fossett said crews can't fullyinvestigate the site until rains subside.But Councilman Tony Cardenas, whose district includes the site, said theoriespoint to a cracked underground pipe that initially caused theearth to give way.The problem intensified, he said, as soil flowed underground to aformer gravel pit next door.""Eventually the material started escaping into there,"" Cardenas said. ""That's whythe hole is growing so large.""Without a storm-water collection system in that area, water continued topummel the area instead of getting diverted, he said.Staff Writers Rick Orlov and Lisa Mascaro contributed to this story.
","Southern California was just recovering from the January 2005 storms in February, when another severe winter storm pummeled the state for six days. Sodden hillsides collapsed, sending some houses sliding down slopes and mud toppling others. The rains killed nine people, destroyed dozens of houses, flooded roads and airports, and cut power for thousands. When the rain stopped, emergency crews began the cleanup, working to clear 20 major roads and fill thousands of potholes, some the size of cars. Engineers assessed whether houses were still habitable. Some ambulance crews were diverted to work spotting signs of flooding and mudslides. ","Good weather in Southern California on Jan. 13, 2005 was accompanied by a massive cleanup effort as crews cleared mud, rubble and debris. It had been the wettest 15 days on record. Countless roads were closed, Amtrak service was disrupted and in La Conchita the entire town of 260 people had been evacuated. February 12-23 another rainstorm hit Southern California. Los Angeles had 9.14 inches of rain with a repetition of floods, mudslides, and sinkholes. Six deaths were reported. Los Angeles County estimated the cost of the two storms to its roads and facilities at $52.5 million. ","January 13, the rain had stopped and cleanup was underway. Many roads had yet to be cleared. The early January storms claimed 28 lives. A late February storm pummeled southern California for six days. Falling trees, mudslides, rockslides, tornadoes, floods, washed out roads and bridges, and sinkholes threatened residents' safety and homes. At least nine deaths were attributed to this storm, and dozens of homes were condemned. Over 100 were rendered temporarily uninhabitable. Los Angeles opened its Emergency Operations Center to better coordinate its storm response. Damage from the January and February storms could top $100 million. 
","In the aftermath of the storm that slammed Southern California for six straight days residents faced traffic gridlock and massive amounts of mud, rubble and debris. The Transportation Department hurried to clear major roads. Fire Department and California Highway Patrol employees worked round the clock. It was critical to reopen roads and highways so that people could get back to work. Caltrans estimated it spent $11 million for immediate repairs and would spend $40 million on roads and other public repairs. State officials and farm and insurance groups estimated damage to homes, roads, and farms at over $100 million. "
D0907,D0907-A,"A Justice Department lawyer wrote a secret memo to the White House in2001 concluding that President George W. Bush has the authority towage preemptive war against terrorists and countries even if theywere not linked to the September 11 attacks, Newsweek magazinereported Saturday.According to the memo there are effectively ""no limits"" on thepresidents authority to wage war, Newsweek reports, noting that itseems to lay the legal groundwork for Bush to invade Iraq evenwithout approval Congressional approval.""The President may deploy military force preemptively againstterrorist organizations or the states that harbor or support them,whether or not they can be linked to the specific terrorist incidentsof Sept. 11,"" the memo reads, according to Newsweek.The memo, titled ""The Presidents Constitutional Authority to ConductMilitary Operations against Terrorists and Nations Supporting Them,""argues that the president should be allowed to order whatevermilitary action ""in his best judgment"" are necessary to protect theUnited States.The presidents decisions to use force ""are for him alone and areunreviewable,"" the memo reads.The 15-page document, dated September 25, 2001, was written byconservative Justice Department lawyer John Yoo and addressed toWhite House counsel Alberto Gonzales. Yoo has since left governmentand is a university law professor.""There was a general awareness after Sept. 11 that the enemy was notsimply Al-Qaeda -- but militant Islam in general,"" Brad Berenson, whoserved in the White House counsels office at the time, told Newsweek.The memo was aimed at granting Bush authority to attack groups suchas the Abu Sayef rebels in the Philippines or the militant ShiiteMuslim group Hezbollah, Berenson told the magazine.
Attorney General nominee Alberto Gonzales is promising senators that he willabide by treaties prohibiting the torture of prisoners, despite deriding therestraints as relics in 2002.White House counsel Gonzales, in line to become the first Hispanic attorneygeneral, had a hand in much of the White House's post-Sept. 11 terrorismpolicies as President George W. Bush's top lawyer.His confirmation hearing Thursday offered Democrats on the Senate JudiciaryCommittee a fresh chance to criticize Gonzales and the advice he gave Bush.Among the most contentious matters is a memo Gonzales wrote in January 2002 inwhich he argued that the fight against terrorism ""renders obsolete"" the GenevaConventions' prohibitions against torture.A month later, Bush signed an order declaring he had the authority to bypass theaccords ""in this or future conflicts."" Bush's order also said the Genevatreaty's references to prisoners of war did not apply to al-Qaida or ""unlawfulcombatants"" from the Taliban.Some of Gonzales' critics say that decision and his memo lead to the torturescandal at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison and abuses of detainees in U.S. custody inAfghanistan and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.In testimony prepared for his hearing, Gonzales said Bush has made clear thatthe government will defend Americans from terrorists ""in a manner consistentwith our nation's values and applicable law, including our treatyobligations.""Gonzales added, ""I pledge that, if I am confirmed as attorney general, I willabide by those commitments,"" according to the testimony obtained Wednesday byThe Associated Press.Last June, the Justice Department withdrew its 2002 memos arguing that thepresident's wartime authority supersedes laws and treaties governing treatmentof prisoners. On Wednesday, former Justice Department officials sought todistance the White House from its legal conclusions.John Yoo, who helped write the memos while at the department's Office of LegalCounsel, said that while Gonzales was briefed on drafts, he and other officialsdid not attempt to influence the content.""The idea that the Office of Legal Counsel was providing advice that wasdictated, demanded or influenced by the White House, that's just flatly untrue,""said Yoo, now a law professor at the University of California atBerkeley.Gonzales has repudiated torture before. ""The president has stated that thisadministration does not condone torture. If anyone engages in such conduct, heor she will be held accountable,"" Gonzales said in a White House online event onJuly 7.Democrats, not satisfied with just those statements, planned to questionGonzales extensively.""It is clear he was in the chain receiving this critical documentation relativeto changing American standards on the treatment of prisoners, so he was not abystander, he was part of it,"" said Sen. Richard Durbin.Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, said Bush firmly backsGonzales' nomination.""Judge Gonzales is a very trusted adviser to the president (and is) doing anoutstanding job,"" McClellan told reporters traveling Wednesday with thepresident aboard Air Force One.Democrats are expecting Gonzales to be confirmed by the Republican-majoritySenate.""I have found him someone I could work with when he wasn't simply pursuing anagenda that was thrust upon him,"" said Sen. Charles Schumer, a Democrat from NewYork.Freshman Sen. Ken Salazar of Colorado, who is Hispanic, was expected to joinSen. John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, in introducing Gonzales at thehearing.Civil rights and humanitarian groups have portrayed Gonzales as the personresponsible for abuses by Americans against terrorism suspects held asprisoners.""Mr. Gonzales bears much of the responsibility for creating the legal frameworkand permissive atmosphere that led to the torture and abuse at Guantanamo andelsewhere,"" said Anthony Romero, executive director of the American CivilLiberties Union.Gonzales' memo from Jan. 25, 2002, argued that the terrorism fight ""rendersobsolete Geneva's strict limitations on questioning of enemy prisoners andrenders quaint some of its provisions.""In his prepared Senate testimony, Gonzales was repeating the contention thatterrorists are not soldiers and thus are not covered by the conventions.Nonetheless, according to his testimony, ""We must be committed to preservingcivil rights and civil liberties.""Democrats wanted to ask Gonzales about other terrorism issues, including thegovernment's detention of Jose Padilla, a U.S. citizen who the governmentalleges was part of an al-Qaida plot to set off a radiological bomb. Arrestedafter the 2001 attacks, Padilla later was designated an enemy combatant, broughtto the brig in South Carolina and prevented from challenging his detention. Hehas sued over his detention.Some Republicans say Democrats are just setting up arguments to use againstGonzales in case Bush decides to elevate him to the Supreme Court, should avacancy occur.___On the Net:

Senate Judiciary Democrats and liberal allies havebeen hoping for months to get their mitts on internal administrationdocuments relating to torture and prison abuses -- some of theminvolving attorney general nominee Alberto Gonzales.There's little or no chance they'll get any of them. The AmericanCivil Liberties Union, for example, last week listed CIA, Pentagon,Justice Department and other memos and cables it wanted made public.One item was described as a ``memorandum from James Ho,attorney-advisor, (Justice Department) Office of Legal Counsel, toJohn Yoo, deputy assistant attorney general, OLC, re: interpretationof Geneva Conventions' Common Article 3 (Feb. 1, 2002).''Most unlikely they'll find out what that one says. Besides, Ho andYoo have both left the department. Yoo is teaching law at Berkeley,although Ho is said to be in this area.Wait a minute! Who was that good-looking guy sitting behind Sen.John Cornyn, R-Texas, during Gonzales's hearing on Thursday? Son of agun. It's James Ho, now Cornyn's chief counsel on the Constitutionsubcommittee.Maybe the Judiciary Committee Dems ought to interview him? 
The question Democratic senators put to CondoleezzaRice last week seemed easy enough to answer: Did the secretary ofState nominee consider interrogation practices such as``water-boarding,'' in which a prisoner is made to believe he willdrown, to be torture?She declined to answer.``I'm not going to speak to any specific interrogationtechniques,'' Rice said, adding that it was up to the JusticeDepartment to define torture.About the same time, senators on another committee were askingnearly identical questions and receiving nearly identical answers fromAlberto R. Gonzales, President Bush's choice for attorney general.The back-to-back confirmation flare-ups spotlight a problem theBush administration faces in its policies for detaining andinterrogating terrorism suspects.In the months since the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, theadministration has insisted that America does not and will not usetorture. At the same time, the government has attempted to preservemaximum leeway in the interrogation of terrorism suspects by notdrawing a clear line between where rough treatment ends and torturebegins.``What the administration is saying is we're not going to torturepeople,'' said John C. Yoo, a University of California, Berkeley lawprofessor who as a deputy assistant attorney general during Bush'sfirst term worked on torture policies.``What the administration does not want to say, and I think forgood reasons too, is what methods the United States might or might notuse short of torture.''Opponents say it is a moral, political and tactical mistake for theUnited States to blur that line. They charge that the administration,while condemning outright torture, deliberately has sought loopholesin laws and treaties that would allow U.S. intelligence officers touse extreme interrogation methods on terrorism suspects held abroad.To protest the administration's Iraq and anti-terror policies --and what they charged was the evasiveness of Rice and Gonzales underquestioning -- Democratic senators have delayed both confirmationvotes until later this week . As a result, the full Senate likely willdebate the definition of torture in a session that could embarrass theadministration and provide fodder for its international critics.Ambiguity on prisoner treatment is causing discomfort among some ofthe administration's allies. Current and former military officers inparticular fear it will result in the mistreatment of capturedAmerican soldiers.``We've dramatically undermined the war effort by getting on theslippery slope in terms of playing cute with the law, because it'scome back to bite us,'' Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a former militaryjudge, told Gonzales during a hearing earlier this month.Graham said he was an ``ardent'' Iraq war supporter and agreed withthe controversial administration view that the Geneva Convention --which bans not only torture but also cruel treatment -- should notapply to terrorists. However, Graham said, ``Humane treatment is theway to go, the only way we can win this war.''Others say the Bush administration is right to preserve somesecrecy about its methods for interrogating prisoners, lest terroristslearn how to thwart them.``The only way we can stop future attacks by al-Qaida is bylearning from (captured suspects) what their plans are,'' Yoo said.``It doesn't make sense to take options off the table at this time.''Others have questioned the effectiveness of harsh interrogationmethods. The FBI has said that the aggressive techniques its agentswitnessed at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and elsewhere were not effective inproducing usable information.The United States has recovered al-Qaida training manuals that tellmembers what to expect if captured and instruct how not to crack underpressure -- just as the U.S. military trains its members on how towithstand questioning if captured.``The last thing you'd want to do is publicly disclose how youinterrogate people, because it would allow them to prepare theirpeople to resist interrogations,'' Yoo said.Gonzales made the same argument in a written response to senators'questions after he was faulted for dodging the question during hisoral testimony.A web of laws and treaties governs how prisoners are dealt with athome and abroad. The torture convention bans torture and ``cruel,inhumane or degrading'' treatment. The U.S. military code bans crueltreatment of prisoners, and CIA officials can be prosecuted for crimessuch as assault when they are abroad. The Constitution prohibits crueland unusual punishment within the United States.Congress has defined torture as conduct intended to cause``severe'' pain or suffering, according to the Justice Department,which noted in its latest memo that ``there is no clear, objective,consistent measurement'' of pain.But legal experts differed last week over whether cruel treatmentthat falls short of torture is prohibited in the case of foreignersheld abroad.In an attempt to clarify American standards on torture andinterrogation, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. -- who was tortured as a POWin North Vietnam -- and Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., wrote anunambiguous definition last fall: ``No prisoner shall be subject totorture or cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment thatis prohibited by the Constitution, laws or treaties of the UnitedStates.''But the language, included in an intelligence bill, was droppedafter Rice wrote a letter saying it ``provides legal protections toforeign prisoners to which they are not now entitled.''Under fierce confirmation questioning from Sen. Barbara Boxer,D-Calif., Rice offered a different justification for removing theprovision: She said it was unnecessary because similar language wasalready included in a defense spending bill that the president hadsigned.But Boxer said that provision had eliminated a specific prohibitionon cruelty committed by intelligence officers, who have beenimplicated in abuses in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere.(Begin optional trim)Human Rights First, a New York-based group, said more than 30detainees have died in U.S. custody in Iraq and Afghanistan, althoughnot all under the control of intelligence officers or as a result ofinterrogation.``Nobody condones or excuses what happened at Abu Ghraib,'' Ricesaid. ``The problem of how to deal with unlawful combatants, though,in a different kind of war, is frankly a very difficult problem.''Rice appears to have had little input on U.S. torture policies.Moreover, according to Kenneth Roth, executive director of the NewYork-based Human Rights Watch, it was Rice who in 2003 pushed thePentagon's general counsel to reaffirm its ban not only on torture butalso on cruelty.(End optional trim)Rice and Gonzales are expected to win Senate approval. But thebattle over what constitutes ``cruel, inhumane or degradingtreatment'' -- and whether it is ever allowed -- will continue.

John Yoo doesn't come across like a warcriminal, though that's one of the more flamboyant charges leveledagainst the smooth young law professor from the University ofCalifornia, Berkeley's storied Boalt Hall.With his even tones and calm demeanor, his natty suits and warmcharm, the 37-year-old constitutional scholar is the embodiment of``reasonable,'' not the first person you'd expect to find at the heartof an international fight over terrorism, torture and the Americanway.But while working for the Department of Justice after the Sept. 11terrorist attacks, Yoo helped write a series of legal memos redefiningtorture and advising President Bush that the Geneva Convention doesnot apply to members of al-Qaida and the Taliban.Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., demanded from the Senate floorlast month that Yoo and other civilian officials be held accountablefor their part in what he called the ``torture scandal'' overtreatment of Iraqi detainees by American soldiers at Abu Ghraib prisonin Iraq.Legal scholar Scott Horton, president of the New York-basedInternational League for Human Rights, called last month for Yoo andothers to be investigated as war criminals for their part in draftingthe memos.And in a lengthy analysis to be published in the Columbia LawReview this fall, Jeremy Waldron, an author, scholar and Yoo's formercolleague at the UC Berkeley School of Law, said that the ``defense oftorture'' by Yoo and other prominent lawyers had caused ``dishonor forour profession.''A year after the abuses at Abu Ghraib came to light, nearly a yearafter the torture memos were leaked, debate over how the U.S.government should treat its prisoners shows no sign of abating.``If you read the history of philosophy from the Greeks to thepresent day, the question of when should we be willing to do somethingterrible in pursuit of some social good is always posed,'' said MarthaNussbaum, professor of philosophy and law at the University ofChicago. ``It would surprise me very much that it would go away.''But as Yoo defends the memos, a measured messenger for some of theBush administration's most controversial policies, he said he issurprised that ``the issue has staying power.''The memos about the Geneva Convention and torture are probably thetwo most controversial documents Yoo worked on with a team of otherlawyers when he was a deputy assistant attorney general with theOffice of Legal Counsel from 2001 to 2003. The former bears Yoo'sname; the latter, that of then-Assistant Attorney General Jay S.Bybee, who now sits on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.Some human rights advocates argue that the administrationcommissioned the memos to provide legal cover for increasinglycoercive interrogation techniques used against suspected terrorists.Yoo vehemently denies such accusations. The administration hasdownplayed the memos' import and said that Bush never embraced theviews of the lawyers who wrote them.At the Council on Foreign Relations and West Point, at Columbia LawSchool and at his own leafy, liberal campus, Yoo argues that the worldas America knew it ended on Sept. 11, 2001, and that the rules of warhave changed because the enemy has changed.``Al Qaeda as a non-state terror organization is not covered'' bylaws, such as the Geneva Convention, that are honored when the UnitedStates fights a bona fide state, Yoo argued earlier this month duringa debate at Berkeley. Thus, ``our leaders have the option to decidewhat system ought to apply.''The debate was a two-on-one bruising in front of an audience thatpolitely applauded Yoo while cheering his detractors, an event inwhich a law student dressed as an Iraqi torture victim greetedspectators with a sign that read, ``War criminal John Yoo facilitatedtorture: He belongs in a prison not a law school.''But a funny thing happened near the end of the forum. Tom Farer,dean of the Graduate School of International Studies at the Universityof Denver, was deep into a verbal salvo when he exhausted his allottedtime but not his argument. Yoo gave up one of his own precious minutesso that Farer could continue pummeling him.``John cedes a minute,'' Farer said with a smile before launchingback into his attack. ``John is a mensch.''Farer would find little argument, at least on that point. Yooinspires deep loyalty in friends, mute collegiality in many fellowscholars (``You know, I'd really rather not talk about him'') and anawkward mixture of kindness and dread in some of his most vocalcritics.And although Boalt students circulated a petition last yeardemanding that Yoo recant his positions or resign, he also has charmedmany of his liberal pupils with a ready classroom wit. Others havebeen disappointed after signing up for one of his courses so theycould hear what a fire-breathing conservative actually sounds likeonly to find a mild-mannered professor at the lectern, accessible andfriendly.``A lot of the concern is that people think he's dead wrong,'' saidRalph Steinhardt, professor of law and international affairs at GeorgeWashington University. ``But you have to understand, from a personalstandpoint, he's a nice guy, has a good sense of humor, dresses nicelyand is as smart as the day is long.''(Begin optional trim)A Korean immigrant who came to this country with his parents whenhe was 3 months old, Yoo has been a prolific writer of journalism andscholarship since his undergraduate days on the Harvard Crimson. He isa regular contributor to the opinion pages of major newspapers,including the Los Angeles Times, New York Times and Wall StreetJournal.Yoo began teaching constitutional and international law at UCBerkeley in 1993. But he has spent many of the subsequent yearsbouncing back and forth between academia and government. Shortly afterYoo took the Berkeley job, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomastapped him for a clerkship.When his clerkship with Thomas ended, he headed to the U.S. SenateCommittee on the Judiciary, where he served as general counsel andhelped Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, with his speeches. Hatch describesYoo as ``a terrific human being.'' Yoo calls Hatch ``a genuinesoftie.''Yoo completed a public service trifecta -- working in all threebranches of government -- with a stint in the Office of Legal Counsel,part of the Department of Justice overseen by then-Attorney GeneralJohn Ashcroft, before returning to Boalt Hall last year.It was there in the uncertain months after Sept. 11 that Yoo workedon the memos that transformed him from a rising star in conservativelegal circles to a lightning rod for international controversy.(End optional trim)Many legal scholars and human rights activists -- along withBerkeley students -- draw a straight line linking the memos andalleged prisoner abuses in Iraq and Afghanistan and at Guantanamo. Yooargues that they do not understand how government really works.``It's a stretch to say that a very limited, tightly held memosomehow translated into orders that soldiers on the ground violatedhuman rights,'' Yoo said. ``That's the difference between law andpolicy.''To his critics, such an argument is disingenuous, but Yoo continuesto defend the memos because he feels ``some sense of obligation toexplain to the public why government reached some of the conclusionsit did.''``No one goes into government wanting to address these kinds ofquestions,'' he said. ``But we were attacked on Sept. 11 withdevastating results. Our government has to think about these things inorder to protect the country.''
Alberto R. Gonzales, the White House counsel, intervened directlywith Justice Department lawyers in 2002 to obtain a legalruling on the extent of the president's authority to permitextreme interrogation practices in the name of national security, currentand former administration officials said Tuesday.Gonzales' role in seeking a legal opinion on the definition oftorture and the legal limits of how much force couldbe used on terrorist suspects in captivity is expected tobe a central issue in the Senate Judiciary Committee confirmationhearings, which are scheduled to begin on Thursday on hisnomination to be attorney general.The request by Gonzales produced the much-debated Aug. 1, 2002, memorandumby the Justice Department that defined torture narrowly and saidthat Bush could circumvent domestic and international prohibitions against torturein the name of national security.Until now, administration officials have been unwilling to provide details aboutwhat role Gonzales had in the production of the memorandumby the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. He hasspoken of the memo as a response to questions, withoutsaying that most of them were his.Current and former officials who talked about the memorandum have beenprovided with first-hand accounts about how it was prepared. Somediscussed it in an attempt to clear up what theyviewed as a murky record in advance of Gonzales' confirmationhearing. Others spoke of the matter apparently believing that theJustice Department had unfairly taken the blame for the memo.A White House spokeswoman, Erin Healy, said Tuesday that while Gonzalespersonally requested the August opinion, he was only seeking ""objectivelegal advice and did not ask the Office of LegalCounsel to reach any specific conclusion.""As the White House's chief lawyer, Gonzales supervised the production ofa raft of legal memorandums that shaped the administration's legalframework for conducting its battle against al-Qaida and other terroristgroups. Of the documents that have been made public, Gonzalesis the author of only one. In that January 2002memorandum he advised Bush that the Geneva Conventions did notapply to fighters captured in Afghanistan.As a result, a major area of questioning at his confirmationhearing is expected to be the role he played inthe production of the other documents, like the August 2002memorandum. The memo concluded that interrogators had great leeway toquestion detainees using coercive techniques that they could assert werenot torture.The Justice Department last week formally rescinded that memorandum and inits place issued a legal opinion saying that torture shouldbe more broadly defined and that there was no needto say Bush had the authority to sanction torture becausehe has unequivocally said that it is not permitted.The revision stated that ""Torture is abhorrent both to American lawand values and international norms."" It rejected the language inthe earlier memo that said only ""organ failure, impairment ofbodily function or even death"" constituted torture punishable by law.Administration officials said over the last few days that Gonzales hadplayed a role in the decision to issue the newlegal opinion as well, but they did not offer specifics.Gonzales' request for the original August 2002 memorandum was somewhat unusual,the officials said, because he went directly to lawyers atthe Office of Legal Counsel, bypassing the deputy attorney general'soffice, which is often notified of sensitive requests for legalopinions made by executive branch agencies, including the White House.The memorandum has become one of the most hotly debated legaldocuments in the war on terror. Democrats and human rightsgroups have complained that it created a permissive atmosphere thatled eventually to serious abuses of detainees in Iraq, Afghanistanand Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The memorandum was addressed to Gonzalesand was signed by Jay S. Bybee, then the headof the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department.Officials dispute how much senior Justice Department officials knew of thememorandum as it was being prepared. A former and acurrent official said that neither Attorney General John Ashcroft norhis deputy, Larry D. Thompson, were aware of the memorandumuntil it was about to be submitted to the WhiteHouse. Another former official said, however, that they were givenprogress reports as the memorandum took shape.John Yoo, a senior Justice Department lawyer who wrote much ofthe memorandum, exchanged draft language with lawyers at the WhiteHouse, the officials said. Yoo, now a law professor atthe University of California at Berkeley, said in an articlepublished Sunday in the San Jose Mercury News that Gonzalesdid not apply any pressure on him to tailor thememorandum to accommodate the White House.Instead, Yoo said that Gonzales was merely seeking to ""understand allavailable options"" in a perilous time when the United Statesfaced unprecedented threats.But a senior administration official disagreed, saying that the memorandum's conclusionsappeared to align closely with the prevailing White House viewof interrogation practices. These officials said the memo raised questionsabout whether the Office of Legal Counsel had maintained itslongstanding tradition of dispensing objective legal advice to its clientsin executive branch agencies.While the nature of Gonzales' specific discussions with the Justice Departmentremains unclear, administration officials said that Gonzales' customary way ofdealing with Justice Department lawyers was to pose questions aboutissues rather than offer his own conclusions, although one saidhis preferences could sometimes be easily inferred from his questions........................... Department officials said that the timing of the revised memorandum,which was posted on the Justice Department's Internet site withoutannouncement late on Dec. 30, was the result of instructionsfrom James B. Comey, the deputy attorney general.Comey, the officials said, told lawyers to complete the revised opinionbefore the end of the year. At the same time,officials said that they were mindful that issuance of thenew opinion might help neutralize the issue for Gonzales evenas it served as a sharp critique of the earlieropinion.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)Gonzales talked about the 2002 memo in a meeting with reporterslast June, when the White House sought to defend itsactions at the height of the uproar over abuses ofprisoners in Iraq. Without discussing his own role in solicitingthe document, Gonzales said that the memo was not apolicy directive to officials in the field, but a responseto questions about the scope of the federal law prohibitingtorture and the international convention on torture.""The president has given no order or directive that would immunizefrom prosecution anyone engaged in conduct that constitutes torture,"" Gonzalessaid. ""All interrogation techniques actually authorized have been carefully vetted,are lawful, and do not constitute torture.""Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., the ranking Democrat on the JudiciaryCommittee, who has signaled he intends to vigorously question Gonzalesabout his role in the memorandums, said Tuesday that hehas been continually frustrated by the White House in tryingto obtain answers and documents.In a letter Tuesday to Gonzales, Leahy said that ""I amdisappointed that, contrary to your promises to me to engagein an open exchange and answer my questions in connectionwith your confirmation process, you have not answered my letters""requesting documents.But Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who is the new chairman ofthe committee, said that Leahy's complaints appeared unjustified. He saidthat one document was for a final version of aJan. 25, 2002, memorandum because the one available is marked""draft."" He said that there is no evidence that thereis any document but the draft.Other requests from Leahy, he said, were for documents that didnot directly bear on Gonzales' actions or views.The Jan. 25, 2002 memorandum is an unsigned draft from Gonzalesto Bush dated Jan. 25, 2002. In it, Gonzales, wrotethat the fight against terrorism had made the Geneva Conventions""obsolete."" In addition, he said the conventions' prisoner-of-war protections neednot apply to al-Qaida suspects and Taliban members captured inAfghanistan.
The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Feb.19:Of all the claims of an electoral mandate made by PresidentBush's supporters, none were as bizarre as the one offeredby John Yoo, a former Justice Department lawyer who helpeddraft the cynical justifications for the illegal detention and tortureof ""unlawful combatants."" ""The debate is over,"" Yoo told TheNew Yorker, adding: ""The issue is dying out. The publichas had its referendum.""It's hard to know what is most outrageous about those comments-- that Yoo actually believes Americans voted for torturing prisonersor that an official who was at the heart ofthis appalling mess feels secure enough to say that. Certainlythe worst possibility is that the public has, indeed, lostinterest.The White House has done everything it can to bury theissue. Nearly a year after the Abu Ghraib scandal broke,the administration still drags its feet on public disclosure, stonewallscongressional requests for documents and suppresses the results of internalinvestigations.But the issue is as urgent as ever. Hundreds of menremain imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, years after any information theyhad might have been useful and in defiance of twoSupreme Court decisions. American soldiers hold thousands of Afghan andIraqi prisoners under rules that remain murky, to put itcharitably.American intelligence is still secretly detaining prisoners -- a practice thathas become embarrassing enough for the Central Intelligence Agency tofret publicly about it. And the administration continues to insistthat the president has an imperial right to sweep asidethe law and authorize whatever he wants. That includes floutingtreaties that prohibit sending prisoners to other countries to betortured. That abhorrent practice has become more common since 9/11and is reported to include sending prisoners to Syria, arepressive nation counted by Washington as a state sponsor ofterrorism.Members of Congress from both parties are proposing new laws oninterrogations. Their intentions are honorable, and new legislation may beneeded. But drafts of these measures risk endorsing some terriblepractices, as well as the idea that the president candeclare himself above the law. Anyway, it's too soon fornew laws; we still don't know what happened and whoapproved it.But that task is now way beyond the purview of theSenate Armed Services Committee, which held important hearings on prisonerabuse. Republican congressional leaders have made it painfully clear thatthey will not hold a real investigation. And no probeby the executive branch can be credible because the stainof prisoner abuse spreads so far. The Justice Department can'tdo it; Attorney General Alberto Gonzales was part of theproblem.We strongly agree with the American Bar Association, which wrote toPresident Bush on Feb. 1 to urge the appointment ofan independent, bipartisan commission with subpoena power. The bar associationtalked about Iraqi civilians in military custody, but we believethat a panel should look at all detention centers andall government agencies.Only a full accounting can begin to heal the nation's imagein the world, clarify the rules, punish those responsible, andclear the names of the hundreds of thousands of otheruniformed Americans who risk their lives to preserve human dignityand the rule of law.

D0907,D0907-B,"The Federalist Society has brought together many of Washington's topconservative thinkers over the last few decades, but Supreme Court nomineeSamuel Alito has been more open than some of his peers about his involvementwith the low-profile legal group.Alito has been a member for at least 15 years and has spoken before both thenational organization and its student chapters on a number ofoccasions.That's a welcome change for the group after the last two Supreme Courtnominations.The Supreme Court Chief John Roberts, the new chief justice, is well-liked byFederalist Society members but belatedly denied he'd ever been a member of theorganization after he was nominated to the high court, even though he once waslisted in its leadership directory.Harriet Miers, who withdrew her nomination to the court, once testified that she""wouldn't belong to the Federalist Society"" or other ""politically charged""groups that ""seem to color your view one way or another.""As she tried to salvage her nomination, Miers quickly put out word that sheregarded the Federalist Society as an important White House ally, but the damagealready had been done. Her deprecating remarks from 1989 had further angeredsome conservatives already upset about her nomination.Notre Dame law professor Rick Garnett, a member of the Federalist Society,complained recently that the organization doesn't always get the recognitionfrom the right that it deserves for supplying ""in no small part, theintellectual heft for a large part of today's conservative movement inpolitics.""""Too often, this administration, present nominees, and even Federalist Societymembers nominated for important government positions have treated the society asif it were something out of 'The DaVinci Code,' or the ultra-secret gaggle ofpowerful reactionary Rasputins that some on the left imagine, or just a goofyband of train-spotters,"" he wrote in a blog posting.The society, founded in 1982 as a forum for conservative and libertarian lawyersto exchange ideas and network, keeps its roster private. But Alito been openabout his membership in the group.As a federal appeals court judge, Alito's participation in the society has beenlimited to avoid any suggestion of bias on issues that could come before hiscourt. He moderated a panel discussion about the anti-terrorism laws that makeup the Patriot Act at the society's November 2004 national conference,introduced a debate on the independent counsel law at the 1989 nationalconference, and has addressed the society on other occasions. An article hewrote on the role of the lawyer in the criminal justice system, based on aspeech he made at the 1997 convention, was published in one of the society'snewsletters.Even with all of that involvement, though, there are no open congratulationscoming from the society's leadership about Alito's nomination to the highcourt.""We really don't comment on things in that type of way,"" said society PresidentEugene A Meyer.Leonard Leo, the society's executive vice president, took a leave of absence tohelp push through Bush's Supreme Court nominees but Meyer said Leo is back atwork now coordinating the society's next national conference, which begins nextweek. Leo made no public comment on Alito's nomination but helped lead aconference call Monday with conservative groups and legal experts, and willcontinue to work for the nomination on his own time.The quiet reaction of the society's leadership notwithstanding, Alito'sFederalist Society membership is seen as ""an important signal to conservativesin the legal community,"" said John Yoo, a law professor at the University ofCalifornia, Berkeley, who worked in the Bush Justice Department during2001-03.""It shows an interest in thinking deeply about the role of the courts in societyand the proper interpretation of the Constitution based on its text andhistory,"" said Yoo, himself a member of the Federalist Society since his collegedays.Yoo said the administration has been sensitive about the society's influenceever since receiving criticism early on from liberals unhappy with the Bush teamfor drawing heavily from the society's ranks for top government jobs andjudicial nominations.Duke law professor Erwin Chemerinsky, a liberal who has spoken at FederalistSociety events, said membership is one more way of letting conservatives knowthat Alito is ""one of them,"" although it shouldn't be a basis for questions athis Senate confirmation hearing.But Ralph Neas, president of the liberal People for the American Way, disagreed,saying Alito's membership in the society is fair game for thehearings.""Of course membership in or participation in Federalist Society events doesn'tdisqualify someone from office but it can help people understand the judicialphilosophy of the nominee,"" Neas said. ""The Federalist Society likes to pretendit's just a debating club, but for last 20 years it has been at the forefront ofthe efforts to push a right-wing counterrevolution in the courts and undodecades worth of precedent.""___On the Net:

In 1991, John G. Roberts Jr., then deputy solicitorgeneral in the first Bush administration, told the Supreme Court itshistoric decision supporting a woman's right to an abortion was``wrongly decided and should be overruled.'' In 2003, when Roberts wasup for a judgeship, he played down his earlier statement, explainingthat he only made the administration's case against Roe v. Wadebecause that was his responsibility as its lawyer.After 11 years in government service and 10 years at one ofWashington's largest law firms, Roberts has earned a reputation as abrilliant litigator who argues passionately for his clients'positions. The question the Senate will debate as it decides whetherto elevate him to the Supreme Court is which of those positions arealso his own.As a long-standing member of the Republican National LawyersAssociation who gave Republican Gov. Jeb Bush private legal adviceduring the 2000 presidential election recount in Florida, Roberts'political loyalties are plain. As a former clerk to then-AssociateJustice William Rehnquist, a protege of former solicitor generalKenneth Starr and a member of the Federalist Society, his conservativecredentials are solid. But in his first two years on the federalbench, his opinions have been generally noted for dispassionatereasoning rather than inflammatory language. Roberts' short time onthe bench, coupled with the relative paucity of his writings, has leftcritics and potential supporters with little by which to judge how hewill vote on the Supreme Court.In his confirmation hearings for a federal judgeship in April 2003,Roberts maintained that he always separates his personal beliefs fromhis duty to follow the law -- including Roe v. Wade, which he describedas a long-settled precedent. He reminded the Senate JudiciaryCommittee that John Adams once represented a British soldier involvedin the Boston Massacre, proof that ``the positions a lawyer presentson behalf of a client should not be ascribed to that lawyer,'' andsaid his own private legal practice had not been ``ideological in anysense.'' Roberts said he has represented supporters as well asopponents of affirmative action, and once helped a group of welfarerecipients get their benefits restored.As President Bush noted Tuesday night, 146 members of the D.C. bar-- Democrats as well as Republicans -- signed a letter calling him ``oneof the very best and most highly respected appellate lawyers in thenation,'' hailing his ``unquestioned integrity and fair-mindedness.''Those strong relationships on both sides of the Beltway's partisandivide could help smooth his Senate confirmation, enabling him topersuade conservatives that he won't be the next David Souter withoutworrying Democrats that he will be the next Antonin Scalia.Still, his journey to the federal bench did not leave himunscathed. He never came up for a vote the first time he was nominatedto the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit by the firstPresident Bush. And his nomination to the same court by the secondPresident Bush attracted opposition from the liberal Alliance forJustice and NARAL Pro-America. Many liberals suspect that theconservative positions he advocated in the Reagan administration wereno different from the positions he would advocate on the court. Manyconservatives think so, too, even though Roberts is less outspoken andless aggressive than some of the other judges considered for thecourt.``I know he's conservative by talking with him about issues,'' saidFred Fielding, for whom Roberts worked as a White House deputycounsel. Fielding said Roberts supported expansive presidentialpowers, and tended toward a ``more literal reading of theConstitution.''C. Boyden Gray of the Committee for Justice, a nonprofitconservative group established to support Bush nominees to the federalcourts, called him a ``brilliant choice.''John Yoo, a conservative professor of law at University ofCalifornia at Berkeley who served in the Justice Department under thecurrent Bush administration, emphasizes what he called Roberts'traditional approach to the law. In the 39 cases that Roberts arguedbefore the Supreme Court -- 25 of which he won -- Yoo said he neverpushed the court to adopt ``big new theories,'' but rather argued thefacts of his cases.``He's the type of person that business conservatives and judicialrestraint conservatives will like, but the social conservatives maynot like,'' Yoo said.``What the social conservatives want is someone who will overturnRoe. v. Wade and change the court's direction on privacy,'' he added.``But he represents the Washington establishment. These Washingtonestablishment people are not revolutionaries and they're not out toshake up constitutional law. They might make course corrections, butthey're not trying to sail the boat to a different port.''John Glover Roberts, 50, was born in Buffalo and grew up in thetown of Long Beach, Ind. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive, hegraduated first in his high school class, then attended HarvardUniversity, graduating summa cum laude in only three years. One of hisadvisers, William LaPiana -- now a law professor who says he ``probablydisagrees with Roberts about just about everything'' -- recalls him asa rare font of middle-America conservatism on a campus that wasoverwhelmingly liberal. He also recalls Roberts as an unusually modestand mature young star who already displayed a judicial temperament.Roberts then excelled at Harvard Law School, becoming managingeditor of the prestigious Harvard Law Review, where he was known assomething of a straight-arrow. David Leebron, who is the president ofRice University and was the editor of the review at the time, recallsthat after working late they would often stop for ice cream. Robertsalways chose the same flavor: vanilla chocolate chip. ``I'm the typeof person who wants to try other things, but he makes his choices andgets comfortable with them,'' Leebron said.Roberts chose a fairly traditional path to legal prominence. Heclerked for Judge Henry Friendly of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the2nd Circuit, in New York, then for Rehnquist. He later worked as aspecial assistant to Attorney General William French Smith, thenjoined President Ronald Reagan's staff as an aide to White Housecounsel Fielding.He joined the Washington law firm of Hogan & Hartson in 1986; thenthree years later joined President George H.W. Bush's administration,arguing cases before the Supreme Court as Solicitor General Starr'sprincipal deputy.Roberts' remarks criticizing Roe v. Wade were included in a briefhe co-authored arguing that barring federal financing of abortioncounseling fulfilled the intent of a law that had not previously beeninterpreted in that manner. Separately, he co-wrote a brief thatclaimed an antiabortion group was not discriminating against women bytrying to shut down abortion clinics through protests; the SupremeCourt agreed with his argument. While Starr's deputy from October 1989to January 1993, Roberts wrote a brief urging the Supreme Court toaccept the constitutionality of prayer at a public school graduationceremony. He also co-authored a brief supporting a law criminalizingthe burning of the American flag. In both cases, the Supreme Courtrejected those arguments.In 1990 and 1991, according to his liberal critics, Roberts alsoco-wrote briefs arguing against the imposition of a new desegregationdecree for Oklahoma public schools and against the need to informdefendants that they may be sentenced to longer terms than agreedunder a plea bargain. The Supreme Court rejected the latter argument.When his nomination to the circuit court died at the end of thefirst Bush administration, Roberts returned to Hogan & Hartson, wherehe headed the firm's appellate practice and frequently argued beforethe Supreme Court, winning a lot more than he lost. He also became amillionaire; his net worth is between $2,780,039.44 and $6,870,000.During his two stints at Hogan & Hartson, he represented variedcorporate and professional clients. The cases he considers mostsignificant, according to his Senate testimony, involved hisrepresentation of a man convicted of filing false Medicaid claims, theNational Collegiate Athletic Association, the state of Hawaii, aroad-sign manufacturer, the Chrysler Corp., a group of coal companies,and Litton Systems.Some of his liberal critics point in particular to a brief he wrotesupporting the National Mining Association in its efforts to barlawsuits by local citizens against a type of mineral extraction thatinvolves blasting off the tops of mountains and dumping the debris instreams.Roberts' name did not appear on any of the briefs during theFlorida presidential vote recount, but sources say he gave Gov. Bushcritical advice on how the Florida Legislature could name George W.Bush the winner at time when Republicans feared the courts might forcea different choice. Still, Paul Mogin -- his former law school roommateand co-clerk, and a self-described liberal -- said Roberts wasnonconfrontational when it comes to politics.``I doubt he has any particular agenda that he'd be going into thecourt with,'' said Mogin, who asked Roberts to be the best man at hiswedding.After being named to the appellate court in 2003, Roberts' firstwriting was a dissenting opinion from a decision by his colleagues onthe U.S. Court of Appeals not to reconsider a three-judge panel'sruling protecting a rare California toad under the Endangered SpeciesAct.Roberts did not rule out the possibility that the act had beencorrectly applied, but thought the court ought to give a developerwhose freedom of action had been restricted in favor of the toadanother chance to make his argument that the Constitution did notpermit the government to regulate activity affecting what he called``a hapless toad'' that ``for reasons of its own lives its entire lifein California.''Besides the toad case, earlier this month he backed theadministration's plan to let special panels of military officersconduct trials of terrorism suspects detained in the U.S. militaryprison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, overturning a lower-court decisionthat had blocked the ``military commissions'' for the past eightmonths.The nominee is married to Jane Sullivan. They have two children,John and Josephine, and have lived for more than a year in athree-story federal-style house on Meadow Lane in Chevy Chase, Md.,that he purchased for $1.225 million in 2003. It has a well-trimmedlawn, and neighbor James McNaughton say Roberts often cuts it himself.``He's Mr. American,'' McNaughton said. ``He's kind of friendly, anice fellow. He doesn't buttonhole you and lecture you on politics orreligion.''Another neighbor, Elizabeth White, a math specialist at aMontgomery County elementary school, said he is a ``wonderful husbandand a wonderful, devoted father.''Staff writers Michael Grunwald, Charles Lane and Nancy Trejos andresearch editor Lucy Shackelford and researcher Madonna Lieblingcontributed to this report.

To his shrillest student critics, University of California,Berkeley, law professor John Yoo -- a mild-mannered, baby-facedacademic who gravitates toward the driest of legal treatises and thesharpest of suits -- incarnates the banality of evil. Yoo has beenaccused of being a war criminal. Cursed out in public. Warned byBerkeley police, last spring, that it might not be safe to appear on alaw school panel.``That was pretty wild,'' said Yoo, the author of a new book, ``ThePowers of War and Peace.'' ``That was the most out-of-control thingthat ever happened to me.''As Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice attempts to lessen anger inEurope over reports that the CIA has operated secret prisons inEuropean countries, it might not be the best time for Yoo to argue hiscontention that the Bush administration has the right to hold ``enemycombatants'' indefinitely without charges, and question them without alawyer present, in wartime. Although even Rice seemed to reverse heradministration's contention that the prohibition on cruel or inhumaneprisoner interrogations didn't apply overseas, Yoo is still ardentlyopposed to such a ban, saying it could cripple the effectiveness ofcoercive interrogations abroad.And even some of Yoo's fellow conservative intellectuals aredisturbed by his contention that President Bush has the constitutionalpower to unilaterally start a war. Yoo has been in perpetual hot watersince the revelation that he helped draft a controversial memo in 2002-- he was a deputy assistant U.S. attorney general at the time -- thatnarrowly defined torture as suffering ``equivalent in intensity to thepain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure,impairment of bodily function, or even death.''But if being a flak-catcher for the Bush administration'smost-criticized wartime practices has unnerved Yoo, it's not apparentwhen he touts his new book, which was released this fall. If he endsup with more critics than readers, so be it.Yoo does not employ the usual rationale for a strong Bushpresidency. He says in his book that it is not the Sept. 11 terroristattacks that justify the extraordinary presidential powers headvocates. In Yoo's view, the constitution itself gives the presidentlots of leeway, allowing him to invade Iraq without congressionalpermission and to disregard such treaties as the Geneva Convention,which governs the moral code of conduct of war.``I'm pretty sure that's an argument no one has ever made before,''Yoo, 38, said recently with evident pride. Most people, he said, ``saythe world's too dangerous and the Constitution's obsolete.''Michael Glennon, a professor of international law at TuftsUniversity, believes that Yoo ``sees the president essentially as anelected king.''``It strains the imagination to believe that those who wrote ourConstitution could so quickly forget the danger that flows fromunlimited power,'' Glennon said. ``If the framers truly intended tocreate a Sun King, why did they explicitly assign so many powers tothe Congress?''To answer this question, Yoo relies partly on the dictionary.Although the Constitution gives Congress the exclusive power to``declare'' war, that wording doesn't mean the president needs toconsult Congress to ``make war'' or ``commence war,'' Yoo's book says.Yoo's critics say this relegates Congress to the role of anambassador making a courtesy call: Excuse me, in case you hadn'tnoticed, we're bombing you to smithereens.``I like John Yoo, but I disagree with many of the things he saysabout the inherent powers of the president,'' said Abraham Sofaer, alegal adviser to the State Department under the Reagan administration,who has argued for years for a more aggressive approach againstterrorism.``What Yoo seems to be saying is that the president has this wholeset of powers in matters of defense that Congress cannot override,''said Sofaer, now a senior fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution. ``Idon't believe there are any powers that the president has thatCongress cannot override.''What most concerns him, Sofaer said, are Yoo's views on thetreatment of detainees.``The torture convention is written specifically for people whothink their emergency is different than any other emergency in humanhistory,'' Sofaer said. ``You can't just say that because you happento be governing the United States during an attack unprecedented sincePearl Harbor, that all the conventions governing the rules of war goout the window.''As criticism grows, some of Yoo's positions seem to be gettinglonelier.Yoo opposed the amendment by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., that wouldban ``cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment.'' The Senate passed theamendment 90-9, with the backing of, among others, former CIA DirectorStansfield Turner and former CIA Counterterrorism Center DirectorVincent Cannistraro.That doesn't dissuade Yoo. ``In the war against al-Qaida, theGeneva Convention doesn't apply,'' Yoo explained in November onC-SPAN. ``Al-Qaida is not a nation. Under the McCain amendment, all wecould do is question people. ... The real effect of the McCainamendment would be to shut down coercive interrogation.''To Yoo, it is crystal clear who gets to decide the differencebetween coercive interrogation and torture abroad.``Outside the United States it would be the president,'' Yoo said.``If the president thinks that because of an extraordinary need toprotect the country, he needs to order an interrogation, he needs tobe able to do that.''There's torture, and then there's cruel, inhumane and degradingtreatment -- conduct below torture. It's a broad term. I think (theMcCain bill) would prevent anything beyond oral questioning.``(Begin optional trim)Yoo's views on presidential powers stand out -- and not just inultra-liberal Northern California. He believes, for example, that Bushhas the final say on treaties.''It's up to the president to decide how to interpret internationallaw and apply it,`` Yoo said, speaking on his cell phone from abustling Starbucks in San Francisco. ''President Bush has the solepower to decide whether to pull the United States out of treaties,break treaties, terminate treaties.``Or that the real check and balance held by Congress in wartime isbudgetary.''That's the primary check,`` Yoo said. ''If (Sen. John) Kerrywanted to stop the war, all he had to do was convince his colleaguesto not pay for it.``(End optional trim)As a conversationalist, Yoo is impeccably courteous,dispassionately affable, unfailingly polite. His prose too ismeasured. Even bland.Which is precisely what inflames his critics.''This hyper-technical legal analyses detached from underlyingmoral and pragmatic considerations ... is a consequence of the law ofwar becoming `overlawyered,' wrote retired U.S. Army Lt. Col. GeoffreyS. Corn, the former special assistant to the judge advocate generalfor law of war matters, in a guest column for Jurist, the online legalnews service of the University of Pittsburg School of Law.``Unlike his chief antagonist, Senator John McCain, Yoo has neverworn a uniform,'' wrote Corn, now a professor at South Texas Collegeof Law.Yoo does have his fans, to be sure. Conservative legal scholarRobert H. Bork called the book a ``brilliant and path-breakinganalysis.'' Judge Laurence Silberman of the U.S. Court of Appeals forthe District of Columbia Circuit -- Yoo served as a clerk for him andfor Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas -- called it``comprehensive,'' ``thoughtful,'' ``provocative.''Even some who ardently disagree with him praise his personalqualities. Tuft's Glennon considers Yoo a friend.``He's a very gentle soul. He's a teddy bear,'' Glennon said.``He's extremely courteous in dealing with intellectual adversaries.He's a creative and original scholar.''However, he added, ``I think his book is just 180 degrees off themark.''
As the nation approaches the fourth anniversary of the9/11 terrorist attacks, there is fresh unease about the government'sability to prevent another strike on American soil.The recent bombings in London and Egypt, yet another overhaul ofthe federal Homeland Security Department and nervousness about the Iraqwar are prompting fresh debate about whether the country ismaking sufficient progress against the terrorist threat.""The key questions are: Are we as safe as we needto be? Are we as safe as we can be?And are we as safe as we think we are?""said Clark Ervin, former inspector general for the Department ofHomeland Security. ""The answer to all of these questions, sadly,is no.""Opinion polls show the public's expectation of a domestic attack isrising, with nearly half telling the Gallup Poll they fearthat they or someone in their family will become aterrorism victim. Also growing are the numbers of Americans whobelieve the Iraq war has made the United States lesssafe from the terrorism threat. Meanwhile, only 34 percent thinkthe United States is winning the terror war, a JulyGallup Poll showed.The angst spilled over in Congress recently, when Rep. Norm Dicks,D-Wash., complained about inaction by the Homeland Security Department inassessing the threat of a nuclear bomb's detonation in amajor American city.""There is a great deal of anxiety on the Hill andin the country about how well the Department of HomelandSecurity is doing,"" Dicks told the department's new chief, MichaelChertoff. ""You have got to show the country that thereis a leader now in charge of homeland security. ...We have got to deal with the major threats ...the use of a nuclear device, for example.""Chertoff defended his early stewardship of homeland security efforts, and infact endorsed Dicks' general point, saying the United States mustdevote the vast majority of its prevention resources to stoppingcatastrophic attacks.To the dismay of big-city officials who want more money spenton mass transit security, Chertoff has been using his honeymoonperiod as homeland security chief to argue that the countrycan't afford to waste precious dollars trying to stop subwaybombings.""A fully loaded airplane with jet fuel, a commercial airliner, hasthe capacity to kill 3,000 people. A bomb in asubway car may kill 30 people,"" Chertoff told the AssociatedPress. ""When you start to think about your priorities, you'regoing to think about making sure you don't have acatastrophic thing first.""Although Chertoff is winning some plaudits for his focus on riskassessment, critics say the country's overall homeland security remains fartoo weak, rife with wasteful spending and unprepared to meetthe challenges of another attack.""America does not have a culture of preparedness,"" said Jay Carafano,a security expert at the Heritage Foundation who in arecent analysis suggested homeland security officials have been manufacturing ""symbolicprograms that create the illusion of caring.""Government officials say it should not be surprising that it wouldtake some time for the massive homeland security bureaucracy --now just two-and-a-half years old -- to get its armsaround the monumental challenge of protecting such a sprawling countryfrom attack. The Department of Homeland Security, authorized by Congressin November 2002, is a compilation of 22 separate federalagencies employing 180,000 people.""It took several decades of organizational and legislative tweaking to revitalizethe ... Department of Defense,"" said Tom Ridge, the department'sinaugural director and former secretary. Ramping up a national anti-terrorismeffort is necessarily an evolutionary process, Ridge said, because Americansare slowly coming to grips with the reality of anewly unsafe world.Ridge and other officials involved in the terrorism fight also contendthey've made major progress. ""We are, I will say, farsafer than we were before September 11th,"" FBI Director RobertMueller said last week. (7/27/05)But critics say that, given the potential consequences of a catastrophicattack, federal officials have not moved smartly enough, or quicklyenough. At the congressional hearing where he lectured Chertoff, Dicksnoted that a nuclear bomb could kill 1 million peoplein New York or Washington.This and multiple other hearings in Congress this summer have highlightedthe enormity of the challenge facing homeland security officials, andthe difficulty of choosing among vastly different prevention strategies.Chertoff is attempting to give the Homeland Security Department a harder-nosededge by adopting the ""risk-assessment"" model for determining what meritstaxpayer dollars and what doesn't. He stuck with that lineeven in the aftermath of the London subway bombings, angeringbig-city politicians who wanted to add millions to mass-transit security.With some reluctance, Congress is also shifting to the risk-assessment standard.Members of Congress have come under harsh criticism for handingout millions in homeland security grants to states like Wyomingand South Dakota -- places that are deemed low securityrisks. But for the second straight year they are reducingthe proportion of money going to largely rural states whilebeefing up funds for big cities.Even then, however, there are widespread debates over what constitutes thebest use of homeland security money. Should aviation security continueto be the No. 1 priority? Should more go intoborder controls? Is technology the answer?Veronique de Rugy, a critic of homeland security spending from herperch at the American Enterprise Institute, says federal officials areright to focus on detecting a nuclear bomb that mightenter the country through one of its ports. But shesays the deployment of 470 radiation portal monitors is agood example of how the government may be wasting enormoussums of money.Nuclear security experts don't believe the monitors can detect, with anyreliability, the highly enriched uranium that is at the heartof a nuclear device, she said.""Have we really spent $800 million for nothing?"" she wrote forthe website Tech Central Station. ""Possibly.""Some say that, given the difficulty of building reliable defenses againstterrorism, the government ought to spend far more on intelligenceaimed at foiling plots before they unfold.According to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, only 8percent of federal homeland security dollars are devoted to intelligenceand counterterrorism this year. By comparison, 37 percent of thefunds are being spent on border and transportation security operations;31 percent on protecting critical infrastructure; and 17 percent foremergency preparedness.Michael O'Hanlon, a security expert at the Brookings Institutions in Washington,says much more needs to go toward counterterrorism, particularly inthe 25 to 35 largest American cities.O'Hanlon recently recommended that Congress pay for 10,000 additional police inthose cities who, working jointly with the FBI, would bethe eyes and ears that might uncover domestic terrorist cells.""Too many localities, even major ones, assume that they will notbe targets in the future simply because they have notbeen the sites of successful attacks in the past,"" hesaid.Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., offered similar advice last week.""It's more likely to be some local cop coming from theDunkin' Donut shop, going behind a super mall ... thatdetects a guy climbing out of a dumpster who justput sarin gas in the ventilation system,"" said Biden.Others advocate a far more aggressive national strategy that relies onface-to-face confrontation of terrorists.John Yoo, a deputy assistant attorney general during Bush's first term,says the United States must become more ruthless and cunningto counteract the resiliency of the al-Qaeda terrorist network. Forexample, he says the United States should carry out simultaneousassassinations of key al-Qaeda leaders.He also suggests setting up false terrorist organizations that would carryout fake attacks, issue phony claims of credit for realattacks, and compete for recruits with al-Qaeda -- all inan effort to ""sow confusion within al-Qaeda's ranks.""Yoo acknowledged that setting up bogus websites, issuing fake public statementsand using taxpayer funds for these purposes might run afoulof existing laws. But Yoo, a staunch Bush supporter, saidthe president's current strategies may not be sufficient to protectAmerican soil.""Al-Qaeda has suffered devastating losses at the hands of the CIAand the U.S. armed forces,"" he said in a speechlast month. ""But it has not suffered a knockout blowand may even be recovering.""
There is a standard response to any inquiryabout the writings or work of Judge John G. RobertsJr., the Supreme Court nominee.The White House defends his past work, which has offended bothconservatives and liberals, with a single response: Roberts was representinghis client or the position of the administration in power.To some critics, that is a cop-out. Shouldn't lawyers, they argue,sometimes be held accountable for their arguments, even when theyare being presented on behalf of someone else? Don't lawyers,especially when they choose to work for the government, believein the cases they represent?Here is the lawyerly response: The answer is yes, except whenit is no.Of course, it is nearly impossible at this point to tellwhich opinions and cases Roberts felt strongly committed to. Butmany legal scholars say that is just the point. Theyargue that the most impressive lawyers are known as muchfor their ability to break ideological ranks as for hewingto them.In fact, these legal scholars say that lawyers, including Roberts, shouldbe commended for their ability to argue against their naturalgrain. That skill, lawyers say, requires more mental dexterity andcreativity than simply advocating for your own opinion.""If only people who are ideologically committed to a particular outcomeargued to the courts, the law would be worse off,""said Charles Fried, who served as solicitor general in theReagan administration and is now a law professor at Harvard.As an example, he cited John W. Davis, who he saidmade the Supreme Court argument against integration at the elementaryschool level in the 1954 Brown v. Board of Educationcase, but who reportedly was not himself an ardent segregationist.""The profession is designed to help the court by making surethat the best possible arguments -- not misleading arguments, notarguments that stretch a point, not arguments that hide precedents-- but that the best possible arguments are presented,"" Friedsaid. ""That's the business we're in. It's very much likeif you were a doctor. Do you only cure peoplewho, when they're cured, will lead their lives as youwere going to lead them?""Still, a trend among prominent prosecutors leaving government for the privatesector is to accept jobs as general counsel to aparticular company -- an approach that reduces the possibility ofhaving to accept undesirable cases as part of a biglaw firm, and offers some evidence that lawyers try topick their cases and clients with care.William P. Barr, the attorney general under former President George Bush,is head of the general counsel's office at Verizon. LouisJ. Freeh, the former director of the FBI, went onto become general counsel for the bank MBNA. James B.Comey, the deputy attorney general, will head to Lockheed MartinCorp. in October as its top lawyer.At the same time, some legal experts draw distinctions between caseslawyers are hired to take, ones that are worked onpro bono and ones that come in the course ofworking within the justice system for a state or federalgovernment.And within each of those categories there are further caveats: lawyerswho are political appointees in the upper echelons of theJustice Department, for example, are considered more closely wedded tothe positions argued for the sitting White House than lower-rankingcareer officers who work for Democrats and Republicans alike.By the same measure, a partner in a law firm whoseeks out a particularly ideological case, either paid or probono, is more likely to be judged as supporting thatcase than a junior associate who had it land onhis or her desk.John Yoo, a prominent conservative legal scholar, held up Theodore B.Olson, the former solicitor general in the current Bush administration,as a model of a lawyer who should be proudof virtually all of his arguments.Olson, he said, is ""the sort of conservative, ideologically conservative, committedconservative, who takes pro bono cases that are designed toadvance conservative causes.""In particular, Yoo cited the Hopwood case, in which Olson, asa private lawyer, successfully argued in front of the SupremeCourt that the race-based admissions policy of the University ofTexas was unconstitutional.""The important thing is, what are people doing in their freetime?"" Yoo said. ""That's when you are explicitly almost supposedto take your own personal views into account.""Not all lawyers agree.""There are some lawyers who think of themselves as basically instrumentsof whoever their clients are, and they pride themselves ontheir professional craft, "" said Cass Sunstein, a law professorat the University of Chicago who was an adviser inthe office of legal counsel in the Justice Department from1980 to 1981.""Then there are lawyers that think generally they'll do their bestfor their clients,"" Sunstein said, ""but on some occasions willrefuse to do cases that bother them, or sometimes seekout cases that make themselves feel good.""But according to Fried, the two are not mutually exclusive.""I have turned down many cases where I say, 'You know,look, forget it, you're just wrong, there's nothing to besaid on your side, I won't do it, find someoneelse,""' he said. ""But that's rarely the case at theSupreme Court level, because if a position is that wrong,it wouldn't have gotten that far.""
John Roberts says his judicial rulings are determined solelyby legal reasoning, not his personal beliefs and values.""Judges wear black robes because it doesn't matter who they areas individuals,"" Roberts, President Bush's nominee for chief justice, toldthe Senate Judiciary Committee. ""That's not going to shape theirdecision. It's their understanding of the law that will shapetheir decision.""Roberts' portrait of the ideal judge -- the detached legal scholar,operating on pure intellect -- raised a basic question aboutthe nature of judging. And it alarmed at least twosenators, who implored him not to leave his humanity behindwhen he takes the bench.""By becoming John Roberts the chief justice, don't ever forget tobe John Roberts the man,"" Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, toldRoberts at his confirmation hearing Wednesday. ""When you put onyour black robe and assume your spot on the SupremeCourt, you will truly bring with you your heart andyour soul.""Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., after hearing Roberts repeatedly refuse to statehis views on the Roe vs. Wade abortion-rights ruling andother past decisions, said she was concerned about ""John Robertsthe legal automaton.""""I don't expect you to say what you would do aboutRoe ... but I do expect to know a littlebit more about how you feel and how you think,""Feinstein said during Wednesday's hearing.Roberts' self-portrait as a judge animated by legal reasoning, divorced frompersonal beliefs, is the flip side of the stereotypical judicialactivist -- the judge who elevates personal views above thelaw. Conservatives scornfully single out the late Chief Justice EarlWarren, who would interrupt lawyers' recitations of legal precedents byasking, ""But is it fair?""On the other hand, said Vikram Amar, a law professor atUC Hastings in San Francisco, psychology and common sense dictatethat ""who the person is has to affect how thejudge behaves.""One way to frame the issue is whether judges can retaintheir humanity without losing sight of the law and becomingpoliticians with gavels. Legal scholars offered varying assessments.""There are going to be cases that judges will look atdifferently because of the values and backgrounds they bring,"" saidStanford Law Professor Pamela Karlan. ""Otherwise, why didn't President Bushjust nominate some random smart federal judge?""For example, she said, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who became thecourt's first female justice when President Ronald Reagan appointed herin 1981, graduated from Stanford Law School with honors butcouldn't get a job as a lawyer. That experience clearlyaffected her sympathetic approach to sex discrimination cases, Karlan said.Roberts ""can't possibly mean it,"" Karlan said of his assertion thatpersonal values are irrelevant. ""It's the kind of thing everyjudge says, and everybody knows it's not completely true.""But John Yoo, a UC Berkeley law professor and a formerBush administration Justice Department official, said Roberts wasn't really claimingthat he could, or should, close his eyes to allpersonal experiences in his rulings.Instead, Yoo said, Roberts was expressing a difficult but desirable goal-- that judges should ""try to put all prejudices, biasesand feelings aside and decide cases as neutrally as possible.Otherwise, why not just have elections for judges?""The classic case, Yoo said, involved Northern judges who ordered thereturn of escaped slaves to their masters before the CivilWar, obeying the Fugitive Slave Law and overriding their consciences.Though history applauds the judges who found ways around thelaw, Yoo said, true judicial values require judges to followthe law or resign from the bench.Roberts used similarly absolutist terms when asked Tuesday by Sen. CharlesGrassley, R-Iowa, whether there was room for personal values inconstitutional interpretation.""You don't look to your own values and beliefs,"" Roberts said.""You look outside yourself to other sources.""He acknowledged at another point that ""we all bring our lifeexperiences to the bench,"" but said the goal of alljudges should be to follow ""the rule of law, nottheir own preferences.""Under renewed questioning Wednesday, Roberts insisted that he didn't discard hisvalues when he became a judge.""The cause I believe in passionately, the one to which Ihave dedicated my career, is the vindication of the ruleof law,"" Roberts said.Amar said Roberts appeared to be attempting to bolster the metaphorhe first used Monday of the judge as an umpirecalling balls and strikes. The comparison oversimplifies the judicial roleand ignores the effect of personal experience, Amar said.Not all cases engage a judge's values, said Stanford's Karlan; forexample, the meaning of a disputed federal law may beresolved by a grammatical inquiry. But she said other questions,like the meaning of the constitutional guarantee of equal protectionof the law or the ban on cruel and unusualpunishment, may turn as much on judges' individual perspectives ason their dissection of legal precedent.For example, she said, the late liberal Justice William Brennan andconservative Chief Justice William Rehnquist were ""two smart, dedicated individualsreaching different views, based on precisely the same (constitutional) language.""
WASHINGTON - As President Bush's counsel, Harriet E. Miers continued theexpansive interpretation of presidential powers favored by her predecessor, AlbertoGonzales, who backed Bush's authority to hold terrorist suspects withouttrial, as well as the White House's right to withholdmore administration documents from public disclosure than in the past.Miers has also been outspoken in her support of reauthorizing theUSA Patriot Act, which gave the executive branch new powersof surveillance over US citizens.Now, Miers is Bush's choice to join the Supreme Court. Thatselection determines how much power a president can wield underthe Constitution. Her nomination, announced Monday, followed the confirmation ofChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who supported broad warpowers for the president in a case he heard duringhis brief tenure as an appellate judge.The two appointments, both of lawyers with extensive White House experience,have raised alarm among critics of the Bush administration's broadreading of executive branch authority.""The fact that the president is now seeding the Supreme Courtwith people who have been handmaidens in his efforts toincrease the power of the executive without any check oroversight whatsoever is very disturbing,"" said Bill Goodman, legal directorof the Center for Constitutional Rights, which sued Bush onbehalf of prisoners at the US facility at Guantanamo Bay.Supporters of Miers, too, have invoked her work on Bush's terrorismpolicies to assuage fears among some conservatives that she maybe too moderate.""In her work respecting the War on Terror and the threatsposed to our country by misuse of foreign and internationallaw, Ms. Miers has applied the Constitution as the Framerswrote it,"" wrote Leonard Leo of the conservative Federalist Society.A New York University law professor, David Golove, said that executivepower is emerging as a defining issue for the SupremeCourt in the post-Sept.11, 2001, era. In case after case,the Bush administration has argued that it has the authorityto take measures it deems necessary to stop terrorists, whileothers have insisted on maintaining checks and balances.""Executive power issues are going to be coming before the courtthat are of tremendous significance,"" Golove said, pointing to challengesto Patriot Act surveillance powers, the treatment of Guantanamo Bayprisoners, and the case of José Padilla, a US citizenbeing held without trial under the authority asserted by Bushto imprison anyone whom the government suspects of being aterrorist.As the lineup of the Supreme Court evolves, so may itsrulings on how much power the Constitution gives the president.That prospect has sent analysts hunting for clues in therecords of Bush's nominees.This summer, for example, when Roberts was still an appeals courtjudge, he was part of a three-judge panel that ruledthat Bush could bypass the Geneva Conventions, which require thatprisoners of war be given court-martials, and could instead trya detainee before a military commission. Their holding reversed adistrict court's finding that the president had exceeded his authority.And in a speech in April 2005,before a GOP lawyers' group,Miers said that reauthorizing the entire Patriot Act was ""critical,""because it ""has been used in so many ways tohelp protect this nation and its people and in thewar on terror.""Miers made her speech in the context of bipartisan calls toamend the law with stronger checks on new surveillance powers.Miers was also part of the administration's legal team when itdeveloped both the Patriot Act and the detention policy forsuspected terrorists. Her role in those internal deliberations, however, isunknown to the public.Some conservatives wonder whether Miers personally supports the administration's approach, oris just backing her client's official policy.Among those raising questions is John Yoo, a former Justice Departmentofficial who helped to draft the Patriot Act and whowrote a memo arguing that Bush could authorize aggressive interrogationtechniques, despite laws against torture.Yoo, now a law professor at the University of California atBerkeley, wrote in an article appearing Tuesday in The WashingtonPost that Miers might shore up conservative support if theWhite House disclosed her private advice to the president aboutthe extent of his executive power.""She may be one of the key supporters in the Bushadministration of staying the course on legal issues arising fromthe war on terrorism,"" Yoo wrote. ""But it is hardto see how the administration could reveal Miers's position onthese issues, given its tough, five-year struggle to preserve theconfidentiality of executive-branch deliberations.""Years ago, Miers argued against expanding government powers in the faceof despite security threats. In July 1992, as the presidentof the Texas bar association, Miers warned against responding toa courtroom shooting spree by infringing ""on precious, constitutionally guaranteedfreedoms.""""The same liberties that ensure a free society make the innocentvulnerable to those who prevent rights and privileges and commitsenseless and cruel acts,"" Miers wrote in Texas Lawyer magazine.""Those precious liberties include free speech, freedom to assemble, freedomof liberties, access to public places, the right to beararms and freedom from constant surveillance. We are not willingto sacrifice these rights because of the acts of maniacs.""With no one sure where Miers would stand on executive poweras a justice, the ranking Democrat on the Senate JudiciaryCommittee, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, said he will question heron the issue to make sure she is capable of""judicial independence.""As she prepares for such questions, Miers may look to Roberts'stestimony last month. Promising the Senate that he would bringan impartial look to cases that involve challenges to executivepower, Roberts cited the late Justice Robert Jackson as arole model.Before he joined the Supreme Court, Jackson was attorney general underPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt.In 1940, before the US was involved in World War II,Jackson adopted an expansive reading of executive power by arguingthat Roosevelt had the authority to defy the Neutrality Actby sending destroyers to Britain for use against Nazi Germany,Golove said.Yet years later, as a justice on the court during theKorean War, Jackson ruled that President Harry Truman lacked theauthority to seize steel mills in the name of nationalsecurity, even in wartime.""The Constitution is the only interest I have as a judge,""Roberts said. ""The notion that I would compromise my commitmentto that principle that has been the lode star ofmy professional life since I became a lawyer... is onethat I reject entirely. That would be inconsistent with thejudicial oath. And Justice Jackson is a perfect example ofthat.""
","Although John Yoo is best known for his 2001-2003 Justice Dept. memos, he has actively expressed his views in later years. He offered his opinion on the nominations of Supreme Court Justices. He urged the U.S. to be more ruthless and cunning in the fight against terrorism setting up fake terrorist organizations that would make fake attacks and compete with al-Qaida for recruits. He contends that the U.S. has the right to hold ""enemy combatants"" indefinitely without charges or lawyers and that the President has the power to unilaterally start a war and overrule the Geneva Convention. ","John Yoo recommends the US develop new, ruthless and cunning ways to combat terrorist networks, some of which might run afoul of existing laws. In his new book, Yoo contends the US has the right to hold enemy combatants indefinitely without charges. He believes the constitution gives the president sole power to interpret international law. He believes cruel, inhumane or degrading interrogation techniques fall short of torture and should be employed at the president's discretion with prisoners overseas. Yoo wrote commentary on Supreme Court nominees John Roberts, Harriet Myers and Samuel Alito and on suggested government disaster response improvements. ","Yoo helped draft the Patriot Act and a memo narrowly defining torture, and wrote ""The Powers of War and Peace"". He thinks the US should be ruthless in disrupting terrorist networks, perhaps setting up false terrorist organizations to sow confusion. He opposes banning secret prisons and harsh interrogations. He advocates extraordinary presidential powers, including making war and interpreting laws. A Federalist Society member, Yoo says Supreme Court nominee John Roberts takes a traditional approach to the law, arguing facts instead of pushing big new theories. Roberts seeks to put biases and feelings aside but doesn't claim he can or should. ","John Yoo defines torture as intense ""pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death."" He claims that ""cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment"" is something worse than torture. He thinks the U.S. should be more aggressive in fighting terrorism and find new ways to destroy networks, even assassinating leaders, setting up fake terrorist organizations and deceptive websites, and fabricating attacks on the U.S. He thinks that a judge should argue the facts of his case, not push for new theories and that courts should not make policy on important social issues.

D0908,D0908-A,"UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on Tuesday expressed deep concern over events in Nepal and urged a return to democracy, after King Gyanendra dismissed the country's coalition government and imposed an indefinite state of emergency.""The secretary general is deeply concerned at the actions taken by the constitutional monarchy in Nepal on Tuesday to dissolve the government, impose a state of emergency and suspend civil liberties and freedom of expression,"" UN spokesman Fred Eckhard said in a statement.
The United States said Tuesday it was ""deeply troubled"" by an apparent setback to democracy in Nepal, where King Gyanendra has dismissed the government and imposed a state of emergency.
The European Union on Wednesday joined international condemnation of Nepalese King Gyanendra's dismissal of his government and swearing in of a new cabinet dominated by royalists.The EU's Luxembourg presidency called for a ""speedy"" return to multi-party democracy.""The EU is deeply concerned about the dissolution of the multiparty government in Nepal and the decision by the king to assume executive powers,"" it said in a statement.""This represents a serious setback to multiparty democracy. The EU has consistently supported multiparty democracy and constitutional monarchy in Nepal,"" it said.Gyanendra said he fired the government of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba for failing to hold elections or to bring peace to a country racked by an increasingly deadly Maoist revolt.The monarch, vaulted to the throne four years ago by a palace massacre that wiped out most of the royal family, pledged to ""restore democracy and law and order in the country in the next three years.""The EU said this was not good enough. ""In the present situation, the EU sees no alternative to a broad-based government. ... The EU calls for the speedy restoration of multiparty democracy in Nepal to better meet the aspirations of the Nepalese people,"" it said.""The EU continues to judge that there can be no acceptable military solution to Nepal's problems and that any search for a solution by military means by either side will only add to and prolong the suffering of the Nepalese people.""
Japan, the top donor to aid-dependent Nepal, on Thursday voiced concern at King Gyanendra's power grab and urged him to restore democracy and release any detained political leaders.Joining a chorus of international condemnation over the king's sacking of the government, Japan said it hoped ""Nepal will recover its peace and stability as soon as possible on the basis of democracy and constitutional monarchy.""""If political leaders are being detained, the government of Japan is deeply concerned about the situation and strongly urges that they be released and that the freedom guaranteed by the constitution restored promptly,"" a foreign ministry statement said.Japan also urged Maoist rebels fighting to overthrow the monarchy ""to achieve peace through dialogue.""Japan gave Nepal close to four billion yen (38.5 million dollars) in grant aid in the 2003 fiscal year and the following year relieved 21 billion yen (202.5 million dollars) of its debt, the Japanese government says.King Gyanendra on Tuesday sacked prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba for the second time in three years and assumed control. He accused elected leaders of failing to control the Maoist uprising which has claimed some 11,000 lives since 1996.
The British government expressed grave concerns Tuesday about politicaldevelopments in Nepal, after the king dismissed the prime minister and declareda state of emergency.Foreign Office Minister Douglas Alexander summoned the Nepalese ambassador inLondon and conveyed Britain's concern at King Gyanendra's actions.""I am extremely concerned to hear of the king of Nepal's dismissal of his primeminister this morning,"" said Alexander.""This action will increase the risk of instability in Nepal, undermining theinstitutions of democracy and constitutional monarchy in the country. We callfor the immediate restitution of multiparty democracy, and appeal for calm andrestraint on all sides during this difficult time.""It was the second time in three years that the king has taken control of thetiny South Asian constitutional monarchy, a throwback to the era of absolutepower enjoyed by Nepal's monarchs before King Birendra, Gyanendra's elderbrother, introduced democracy in 1990.King Gyanendra denied his takeover was a coup, although soldiers surrounded thehouses of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and other government leaders.Telephone and Internet lines were snapped, flights diverted and civil libertiesseverely curtailed.
A power grab by Nepal's King Gyanendra provoked condemnation from his mostinfluential allies, the United States and India, but China remained neutral _ asign of Beijing's growing ties with the Himalayan nation, some analystssay.Beijing said Gyanendra's move to dismiss the government and impose a state ofemergency in Nepal last Tuesday was an ""internal matter.""China's reaction, coupled with a recent move by Gyanendra to close the Nepaloffice of the Tibetan spiritual leader-in-exile, the Dalai Lama _ whom Beijingdespises and labels a dangerous separatist _ has prompted speculation amongIndian analysts that the king wants to enlist China's support in fighting theMaoist rebels.Gyanendra ""must have factored in China into his calculations,"" said KalimBahadur, a Nepal expert and retired professor of international relations in NewDelhi.""Any intelligent ruler in Nepal would try to take advantage of its strategicposition,"" he said. ""And Gyanendra is a clever man.""China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan said on Thursday he had noinformation on whether Nepal _ a mountainous nation sandwiched between India andChina _ had asked for Beijing's help in the fight against the rebels, but he wasquick to condemn the guerrillas.Although Nepal's Maoist rebels claim to be inspired by Chinese revolutionaryleader Mao Zedong, Beijing has long distanced itself from theinsurgents.""They steal the name ... (of) China's great leader, Mao Zedong. We feel angry,""Kong said.He added that as ""a close neighbor of Nepal, China considers its peace andstability most important.""S.D. Muni, a former Indian ambassador to Nepal, said Beijing has becomeincreasingly concerned by growing U.S.-Nepal ties, which the government of PrimeMinister Sher Bahadur Deuba _ dismissed by Gyanendra on Tuesday _ had activelysought.""They (the Chinese) viewed Deuba as too close to India and the United States,""he said.The closing of the Dalai Lama's office and a recent crackdown on Tibetanrefugees _ both at the instigation of the king _ could reflect closer ties withBeijing, Muni said.Communist troops marched into Tibet in 1950. Beijing says it has been part ofChina for centuries and has spent decades trying to suppress pro-independencesentiment. In the past, Katmandu had been tolerant of Tibetans fleeing China'scommunist rule, with thousands of them settling there.Gyanendra's shift toward China echoes similar moves his father, King Mahendra,made in the 1960s. Mahendra, himself an absolute monarch, also sought to forgecloser ties with China to counter India's dominance in the Himalayankingdom.At the time, Beijing was eager for improved relations with Nepal as a wedgeagainst India with whom it fought a brief border war in 1962.But if the king hopes to get China on board against the rebels, he'll have to doso without offending Nepal's biggest backers _ India and the United States, bothof which have strongly criticized Gyanendra's power play.The United States has given Katmandu millions of dollars in military anddevelopment aid since Nepal signed on to Washington's war on terror followingthe Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.So far, the Americans haven't made any decision on the continuation of aid.""It's a fluid situation,"" said David Kennedy, spokesman at U.S. Embassy in NewDelhi.Kennedy said the U.S. ambassador met the king's newly appointed foreign ministerand conveyed Washington's ""concerns about the setback to democracy inNepal.""India has also held off commenting on the status of military aid to Nepal andhas established contacts with the new government.New Delhi wants to secure its border and minimize links between Nepal's rebelsand its own Maoist insurgents. India's interests in the Himalayan nationactually go beyond strategic concerns, drawing from the two neighbors'historical ties, and it is unlikely to back away from support for Nepal in itsfight against the Maoist rebels.""India will try to engage the king. It will not do anything dramatic,"" said UdaiBhaskar at the New Delhi-based Institute of Defense and StrategicAnalysis.
The leader of Nepal, King Gyanendra, unexpectedlydissolved the government and claimed absolute power Tuesday,justifying the moves as necessary to restore peace and democracy inthe face of a Maoist insurgency that has spread to nearly every cornerof the picturesque Himalayan nation.Political opponents described the action as a coup. Internationalair service was suspended, phone and Internet connections were cut andthe army was reported to be patrolling streets in the capital ofKatmandu. Security personnel surrounded the home of the primeminister, Sher Bahadur Deuba, according to news agency reports.In a rare televised address, Gyanendra, 58, said he had decided todissolve the government -- the second time he has done so in the pastthree years -- because it had failed in its duty to hold parliamentaryelections or end the Maoist rebellion. He said he would form a newcabinet under his leadership and vowed to restore ``effectivedemocracy within the next three years.''But the king also imposed a state of emergency and suspended anumber of constitutional liberties, including the rights to freespeech, assembly and privacy, according a statement that wassummarized by the Associated Press.Taken together, the moves added to the sense in the region thatNepal is in a downward spiral, with no clear path toward repairing itsdysfunctional politics or bringing an end to the violence that hasclaimed an estimated 10,000 lives since the Maoists launched their``people's war'' in 1996.Gyanendra's announcement poses a policy challenge for the UnitedStates, which has provided Nepali security forces with about $22million in light weaponry and other forms of military aid during thepast several years. Human rights groups have condemned both sides inthe conflict for widespread abuses, but U.S. officials have justifiedthe aid on the grounds that without it, the Maoists might win -- andNepal could join the roster of failed states hospitable to terrorism.In Katmandu this afternoon, the U.S. Embassy issued a statementexpressing concern at the ``apparent setback for democracy'' and saidits diplomats would be ``consulting with Washington'' on anappropriate response.The conflict is also of deep concern to neighboring India, which iswaging its own struggle against Maoist rebels -- some with links tothe Nepali insurgents -- in a number of eastern states and hasprovided Nepal with military aid. In a strongly worded statementTuesday, India's Foreign Ministry condemned Gyanendra's announcementas ``a serious setback to the cause of democracy in Nepal'' and ``acause of grave concern.''With no phone or Internet links to Katmandu, details of thesituation there were sketchy. A New Delhi-based Western diplomat whospoke with a colleague in Katmandu Tuesday afternoon said thecolleague had described the city as ``relatively calm,'' with streetsfilled with traffic and shops operating normally. But the mood wasclearly tense. Anticipating possible unrest, residents formed longlines at grocery stores and gas stations to stock up on supplies, andarmored vehicles with mounted machine guns patrolled the streets, newsagencies reported.Against that backdrop, some international air carriers canceledtheir flights into the capital, while others were turned back byNepalese authorities before they could land.For the past two centuries, Gyanendra's family has dominated Nepal,a country of 25 million people that is as impoverished as it isbreathtaking. The king's action Tuesday effectively restored themonarchy to the position of absolute power it occupied beforeGyanendra's elder brother, King Birendra, established democracy in1990.
Nepal's King Gyanendra named a new CabinetWednesday, a day after dismissing the government and declaringabsolute power in a surprise move that he said was aimed at restoringdemocracy and ending a nine-year Maoist rebellion.Contact with the outside world remained limited and telephone andInternet service, severed on Tuesday, had yet to be fully restored.Dozens of politicians have been arrested and many others have goneinto hiding, an opposition politician told the Associated Press.Soldiers and riot police patrolled the capital, Katmandu.There were no reports of serious unrest, however, and internationalflights to Katmandu resumed on a limited basis. Traffic was movingnormally in the crowded capital and most shops were open, according tonews reports.State radio said that Gyanendra would head the 10-member Cabinetbut gave few other details. ``The king has expressed confidence thateveryone will support and cooperate with the new Cabinet,'' the palacesaid in a statement.In announcing his decision on Tuesday, Gyanendra said he wasdissolving the government and firing the prime minister -- for thesecond time in three years -- because the government had failed in itsduty to hold parliamentary elections and curb the Maoist insurgency,in which about 10,000 people have died. He vowed to restore democracyin three years.Nepal's new home minister, Dan Bahadur Shahi, who was sworn in onWednesday, said the government would soon begin laying the groundworkfor resuming peace talks with the Maoists. ``The king has the chiefexecutive authority now, so it will be easier for the rebels to comefor peace talks,'' Shahi said on state radio. ``It is what they havebeen wanting.''Gyanendra's power grab has been widely condemned by Nepal's allies,including the United States, Britain and India, all of which have beenproviding the government with various forms of aid in its struggleagainst the rebels. India's Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday thatPrime Minister Manmohan Singh would not attend a regional summit inBangladesh, where Gyanendra had been planning to represent Nepal.Bangladesh postponed the summit in response.In addition to dissolving the government, Gyanendra suspended anumber of key civil liberties, including freedom of the press. Suchmeasures ``put the Nepalese people at even greater risk of humanrights abuses,'' said a statement issued jointly by AmnestyInternational, Human Rights Watch and the International Commission ofJurists.
China respects the choice of Nepalese in developing their own country and sincerely wishes the nation to realize social security, economic development and ethnicpacification, Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan told a regular press conference here Tuesday.He made this remark when asked to comment on Nepal's King Gyanendra's Tuesday announcement of dissolving the coalition government led by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and forming a new government under his own ""chairmanship"".Calling this decision ""an internal affair of Nepal,"" Kong said that China will respect Nepalese people's option on how to developtheir own country.Deuba was appointed prime minister by Gyanendra on June 2, 2004,and sworn in on July 5, 2004.
Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz on Thursday had a telephonic conversation with King GyanendraBir Bikram Shah Dev of Nepal, a Foreign Office spokesman said.Matters relating to the holding of the 13th South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Summit as well as Pakistan-Nepal relations were discussed, the spokesman said in a press release issued here on Thursday.King Gyanendra shared Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz's disappointment over the postponement of the SAARC Summit and expressed full confidence in Pakistan to set up new dates for the summit and assured that he would certainly come to represent Nepalat the summit, the spokesman said.Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz is the current chairman of SAARC.The prime minister conveyed to King Gyanendra that recent developments in Nepal were its internal matter, the spokesman said.Pakistan strictly adheres to the principles of non-interventionon and non-interference in the internal affairs of states and Pakistan has consistently upheld these principles, Shaukat Aziz said.The prime minister also assured King Gyanendra of Pakistan's support for the unity, sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of the Kingdom of Nepal.Pakistan and Nepal share the objective of combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, the spokesman said, adding Pakistan will continue to assist Nepal in the economic, social andtechnical fields.
","When King Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev of Nepal seized absolute power on Feb. 1, 2005, the United States, Britain, India and the United Nations quickly condemned the move calling for a return to democracy. China announced its respect for the choice of the Nepalese, but later condemned its Maoist rebels. On Feb. 2 the European Union condemned the King's action and called for a ""speedy"" return to multi-party democracy. On Feb. 3 Pakistan's Prime Minister opined that recent developments were Nepal's internal matters while Japan voiced concern and urged a return to democracy. ","The US faced a policy challenge resulting from the unexpected action of Nepal's King Gyanendra in dissolving the government and claiming absolute power. The king claimed it was necessary to restore peace and democracy in the face of Maoist insurgency. The US, Britain and India who provide aid to Nepal have widely condemned the king's action. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan expressed deep concern and the European Union joined the international condemnation of Gyanendra's action. Japan, another aid donor to Nepal, voiced concern at the power grab. China called the action ""an internal affair"" and Pakistan adopted the same approach. ","Nepali King Gyanendra's power grab added to the regional sense that Nepal is in a downward spiral. The US, UN, EU, India and Britain condemned the move as a setback for democracy. The US and India have made no decision on continuation of military aid they were providing to Nepal in its struggle against rebels. Top Nepali aid donor Japan urged peace through dialogue. India wants to minimize links between Nepal's and India's rebels. PM Singh canceled his attendance at a summit in Bangladesh, which was postponed in response. Pakistan and China remained neutral. Human rights groups condemned both sides. ","Most countries, including the U.S., Britain, India, and Japan, have condemned Nepali King Gyanendra's seizure of power. The U.S. has not yet decided whether to continue its military and development aid. India has not yet commented on its military aid but is expected to continue to support Nepal's fight against the Maoist rebels. Both the E.U. and the U.N. condemned the move and called for an immediate return to multi-party democracy. International organizations including Amnesty International have denounced the suspension of civil liberties. China alone remained neutral, maintaining that this was an ""internal matter."" "
D0908,D0908-B,"The White House said Monday that it had ""real concerns"" about over the February 1 power grab by Nepal's King Gyanendra and urged him to enact democratic reforms.""We have real concerns about the steps back from democracy that have been taken in Nepal,"" said spokesman Scott McClellan. ""We will continue to make our views known to the government in Nepal.""Gyanendra, who controls the army, last week fired the government for failing to organise elections and for failing to end the Maoist insurgency, named a loyalist cabinet under his chairmanship, declared a state of emergency and pledged to restore multi-party democracy in three years.In the meantime scores of political leaders, party and union leaders are under arrest, press censorship has been imposed and any criticism of the king's action has been banned.""We urge everybody to continue to move forward on democratic reforms, and that includes the government of Nepal. It is a concern, the steps that they have taken,"" said McClellan.Washington provides Nepal's army with badly needed weapons and training in its fight against Maoist rebels, considered by Washington as terrorists. The revolt has claimed more than 11,000 lives since 1996.
Nine UN human rights experts on Tuesday expressed deep concern at King Gyanendra's seizure of power in Nepal last week and called for the restoration of democracy.The arrest of political figures extended from the whole cabinet all the way down to middle level party workers and student leaders, while the military was running all media outfits in the country, the group warned.""We are deeply concerned at the actions taken by King Gyanendra of Nepal to dissolve the constitutional government ... and to assume direct power,"" the experts said in a joint statement.""The wave of arrests and detentions, and the actions against the media are a serious setback for the country.""We consider that steps should be taken to reinstall democratic institutions and to protect Nepalese citizens and their representatives, as well as human rights defenders, journalists, lawyers and political leaders,"" they added.Human rights activists and critics of the regime were caught in the clampdown and some had gone into hiding to avoid arrest, the experts said.The nine included UN special rapporteurs on torture, freedom of expression, arbitrary detention, involuntary disappearances and the independence of the judiciary.
US ambassador to Nepal James Moriarity has been asked to return to Washington for consultations, the State Department said Monday, two weeks after the country's monarch sacked the government, declared a state of emergency, and took absolute power.In a statement, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher decried the deteriorating conditions in Nepal, including the arrests of several pro-democracy activists, since the February 1 power grab by King Gyanendra.""We remain deeply troubled by developments in Nepal,"" Boucher said in a statement.""King Gyanendra's dismissal of the government, declaration of a state of emergency, detention of politicians, human rights workers and students and the suspension of fundamental constitutional rights is a step away from Nepal's path toward democracy.""During a weeklong stay in Washington, Boucher said, Moriarty will meet with US officials to assess developments in Nepal, while the US government ""considers what steps we will take to support the Nepalese people's quest for democracy, peace, security and development. He will then return to Nepal,"" Boucher said.""The United States supports a peaceful, prosperous and democratic Nepal,"" the spokesman continued.""We call on those in Nepal who are committed to the country's future to engage in meaningful political discussions leading to national elections,"" said Boucher.
Norway on Tuesday followed the United States, the European Union and India in recalling its ambassador in Nepal to protest King Gyanendra's seizure of absolute power.""In light of the latest developments in Nepal, the Norwegian ambassador Tore Toreng has been recalled today (Tuesday) for consultations,"" the Norwegian foreign ministry said in a statement.On February 1, Nepal's King Gyanendra sacked the government, claiming it had failed to quell a Maoist insurgency that has claimed more than 11,000 lives since 1996.He then appointed a pro-royalist cabinet headed by himself and declared a state of emergency in the Himalayan kingdom.Responding to the move, the Maoist rebels have declared a general blockade, which they say will continue until Gyanendra reverses his actions, and the Nepalese army has been put on high alert.The dissolution of the Nepalese government is a ""serious setback for democracy,"" Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Petersen said in the statement.Norway, which is not an EU member, also implied that it might freeze aid to Nepal if the situation there does not improve.
Nepal's media has been ""suffocated"" through a climate of fear and self-censorship since King Gyanendra seized power, the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) said Thursday.In a statement issued by the Brussels-based organisation during a visit to Kathmandu by its president, Christopher Warren, the IFJ said journalists' fear for their safety were among the factors ""crippling"" democracy in Nepal.""Since King Gyanendra's royal coup on February 1, he and his army have suffocated the media by directly enforcing censorship through armed military intervention and indirectly fostering a climate of fear and self-censorship,"" Warren said in the statement.""As a result of this sweeping censorship, media organisations have been sh to visit Misturi in the past week and found him to be ""very well, healthy"", and keen to renew his anti-government protests if released by a court.
An envoy of Nepalese King Gyanendra Sunday met Indian Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran and briefed him about the situation in the Himalayan kingdom, almost a month after the monarch sacked the government and seized absolute power, a report said.The Press Trust of India news agency said Sharad Chandra Shah, a close aide of Gyanendra, is in New Delhi to attend a conference but also used the opportunity to clear the air of ""misapprehensions"".Saran explained the need for immediate restoration of the democratic process in Nepal, the report said.Nepal wanted India to show ""greater understanding"" to its sensitivities, saying King Gyanendra needed time to restore the democratic process, the report said.Indian foreign ministry officials were unavailable for comment.Gyanendra Thursday promised to restore democracy in the Himalayan kingdom in the next three years. He said sacking the government had been a last resort.India has been sharply critical of the king's appointing a pro-royalist cabinet headed by himself and declaring a state of emergency in the Himalayan kingdom on February 1.India, along with the United States and Britain, has been an important backer of Nepal in its drive to crush a Maoist insurgency that has sapped the economy of one of the poorest countries in the world.India, which shares a nearly 1,600-kilometer (990-mile) border with the Himalayan kingdom, is concerned the Maoist violence in Nepal, which has claimed 11,000 lives since 1996, could spill into Indian states where radical leftist groups are powerful.On Tuesday, India and Britain announced a suspension of military aid to Nepal.
Nepal's foreign minister met his Indian counterpart in New Delhi Monday in the first ministerial contact between the neighbours since King Gyanendra seized power in the Himalayan kingdom.Nepalese Foreign Minister Ramesh Nath Pandey arrived here early Monday on a three-day working visit, a foreign ministry official said.He held talks over lunch with Indian Foreign Minister Natwar Singh.Pandey, appointed to his post by Gyanendra, was accompanied by a delegation that included foreign secretary Madhu Raman Acharya.""The visit is related to the current political situation in Nepal,"" the Press Trust of India news agency quoted an unnamed Nepalese official as saying.The visit to New Delhi is Pandey's first trip outside Nepal since the king who assumed absolute power by dismissing the government on February 1.Gyanendra imposed emergency rule and suspended civil liberties, saying he was forced to act to tackle a nine-year Maoist revolt that has claimed more than 11,000 lives.India has strongly condemned Gyanendra's power grab and urged an immediate restoration of democracy in the country.It has joined Britain in cutting off military aid to the Nepal, which is heavily dependent on foreign support for the battle that it has been waging since 1996 against the Maoist insurgents.India, which shares a nearly 1,600-kilometer (990-mile) border with the Himalayan kingdom, is also concerned Maoist violence in Nepal could spill into Indian states where radical leftist groups are powerful.Pandey's visit follows a visit to New Delhi last month by Sharad Chandra Shah, a close aide of Gyanendra.Shah, who met Indian Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran, said Nepal wanted India to show ""greater understanding"" of its problems, adding King Gyanendra needed time to restore democracy.Gyanendra has said he will restore democracy and peace in the kingdom, nestled between India and China, in three years.
Japan on Monday extended 17.1 million dollars in aid to Nepal while urging King Gyanendra to return the country to democracy.The Japanese government announced the non-military aid in a statement here that also said Tokyo was ""strongly urging that political leaders be released and that freedom guaranteed by the constitutional be restored promptly.""Tokyo ""believes that strengthening of the democratization process under a system of democracy and a constitutional monarchy will facilitate a sustainable development in Nepal,"" the Japanese statement said.""Japan also urge the Maoists to achieve peace through dialogue,"" it added.The announcement came after Nepal's Finance Minister Madhukar Shumsher Rana said international donors want Gyanendra to end emergency rule in the aid-dependent kingdom before promising continued development support.Last month Gyanendra dismissed the impoverished country's government, imposed emergency rule and suspended civil liberties, saying he did so to tackle a nine-year Maoist revolt that has claimed more than 11,000 lives.Nepal relies on international donor aid and loans for more than half its development budget. Its economy has been in growing shambles amid the mounting revolt which has scared away tourists, another major income source for the Himalayan nation.
Nepal, facing growing world pressure to free political detainees, freed Thursday eight party leaders and activists arrested after King Gyanendra's power takeover, a party official said.Among those released were former state foreign affairs minister Prakash Sharan Mahat, who was a member of the four-party coalition government dismissed by Gyanendra February 1.""Eight political leaders and activists were released on Wednesday,"" Bhanubhakta Dhakal, an official of the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist, told AFP:Others freed included student leaders and former lawmakers.But two former prime ministers Girija Prasad Koirala, Nepal's first elected prime minister, and Sher Bahadur Deuba, who was fired by the king when he seized power, remained under house arrest.King Gyanendra seized control of Nepal on February 1, firing the government, imposing emergency rule and vowing to tackle an increasingly bloody Maoist revolt that has claimed 11,000 lives since 1996.He has given himself three years to restore peace and democracy.Rights groups say over 400 activists are in detention or under house arrest.But Nepal's royal-appointed foreign minister Ramesh Nath Pandey said in New Delhi that ""very few people are in detention.""Word of the release of the eight came after the World Bank said late Wednesday it was freezing release of more aid to Nepal, while it assessed events on the ground including protection of human rights.Nepal relies on international donor aid and loans for more than half its development budget to prop up an economy devastated by the Maoist insurgency.Last month, India and Britain suspended military aid to help Nepal's ill-equipped army battle the Maoists and called for the king to restore democracy. The United States is mulling similar action.India has told the king to mend fences with Nepal's politial parties, saying Gyanendra's move had only served to deepen the crisis facing the country.
Nepalese Foreign Minister RameshNath Pandey held talks with Indian External Affairs Minister K Natwar Singh here on Monday to discuss the political developments in the Himalayan Kingdom.Pandey, who is on a three-day working visit, is trying to allayNew Delhi's apprehensions over the sacking of Sher Bahadur Deuba Government, imposition of emergency and detention of political leaders by King Gyanendra.This is the first official high-level visit to India since Nepalese King Gyanendra reshuffled the cabinet on Feb. 2.Pandey is accompanied by Foreign Secretary Madhuraman Acharya and other senior officials of the ministry.""The visit is related to the current political situation in Nepal,"" the Press Trust of India quoted a Nepalese official as saying.India has criticized Gyanendra's action and suspended since February 1 all military aid to the Kingdom engaged in fighting anti-govenrment insurgency.
","The U.S. underlined its concern with the situation in Nepal with a statement from the White House on Feb. 7 and recalling of its ambassador on Feb. 14th. The European Union, India and Norway followed suit, recalling their ambassadors. U.N. human rights experts and the International Federation of Journalists denounced human rights violations in Nepal. Then on Feb. 22 India and Britain suspended military aid to Nepal. In early March Japan extended $17.1 million in aid to Nepal while urging a return to democracy and the World Bank announced that it was freezing aid while assessing the situation. ","International concerns continue over King Gyanendra's seizure of power. Nine UN human rights experts expressed deep concern. The US, The European Union, India, and Norway have all recalled their ambassadors to Nepal. India and Britain have suspended military aid to Nepal. Japan did extend $17.1 million in non-military aid to Nepal while urging that freedom guaranteed by the constitution be promptly restored. The World Bank froze release of aid to Nepal while it assessed protection of human rights there. The International Federation of Journalists said that Nepal's media has been ""suffocated"" by King Gyanendra's seized power. ","The US ambassador, recalled to Washington for consultations, urged meaningful political discussions leading to national elections. The International Federation of Journalists reported censorship and a suffocated media in Nepal. India told Gyanendra his moves had deepened Nepal's crisis.

The World Bank froze the release of more aid to Nepal. Japan extended Nepal $17.1 million in non-military aid while urging a return to democracy. Tourists have been scared away from Nepal. ","The U.S., the E.U., India, and Norway recalled their ambassadors to protest the king's seizure of power.

Nine U.N. human rights experts have expressed deep concern over the king's actions and the International Federation of Journalists has asserted that Nepal's media have been ""suffocated."" "
D0909,D0909-A,"Britain expects an ""imminent"" statement from the IRA as to whether the Northern Irish paramilitary group is to agree to an appeal from its political wing to abandon violence, a government minister said Monday.The comments from Northern Ireland Minister Peter Hain -- who said the IRA statement could ""open a new chapter"" for the British-ruled region --  came as it was announced that Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern would meet in London this week.The pair would meet at the House of Commons on Wednesday, officials in Dublin said, with Ahern also holding talks with Ian Paisley, leader of Northern Ireland's biggest Protestant political group, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).London and Dublin are awaiting for an Irish Republican Army response to a call from Gerry Adams, leader of the group's Sinn Fein political wing, for an end to violence.In April, Adams called on the IRA to ""fully embrace and accept"" democratic means and end all paramilitary activities.""I am confident, now, with an imminent IRA statement expected, which I hope will be credible, that it will open a new chapter in Northern Irish politics,"" Hain told BBC Radio Ulster.Hopes are rising in Northern Ireland that the IRA will, by the end of June, announce a plan for a complete and swift process of disarmament.A deal on the so-called ""decommissioning"" of IRA weapons was almost reached at the end of last year, but foundered on demands from the DUP that the process by verified through photographs.Northern Ireland has seen a virtual end to more than 30 years of violence since the landmark 1998 Good Friday peace deal, but Dublin and London, as well as an independent monitoring body, have accused paramilitary groups of continued criminal activities.The IRA's alleged misdeeds were highlighted by a massive bank raid in Belfast in December, blamed by police on the group, as well as the murder of Robert McCartney, a Belfast man beaten and stabbed to death in a bar in what his relatives say was an attack carried out by IRA activists.
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern admitted on Tuesday that he had held a series of private one-on-one meetings on the Northern Ireland peace process with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, but denied they had been secret in any way.Answering questions in parliament, Ahern told MPs that the meetings with Adams, whose party is the political wing of the IRA, Northern Ireland's main Catholic paramilitary group, had merely been to maintain dialogue.He said there had been ""possibly three or four meetings"" with Adams since March.""On balance, these meetings at this particular time were better conducted outside the glare of publicity,"" Ahern said.In April, Adams appealed to the Irish Republican Army (IRA) to end violence and fully embrace democratic means.Ahern said he explained to Adams the clear position required by the Irish government before negotiations could resume on restoring the power-sharing political institutions in British-ruled Northern Ireland.These included a total end to IRA paramilitarism and related criminality and full decommissioning of the IRA's arms and explosives arsenals.""It is only on that basis that we can move forward,"" Ahern said.Ahern is to meet his British counterpart Tony Blair in London on Wednesday.He will also be holding talks with Ian Paisley, leader of Northern Ireland's biggest Protestant political group, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).Ahern stressed to MPs that Northern Ireland was entering the summer season of Protestant loyalist Orange Order marches, that traditionally cause tensions between Catholics and Protestants.Hopes are rising in Northern Ireland that the IRA will, by the end of this month, announce a plan for a complete and swift process of disarmament.A deal on the so-called ""decommissioning"" of IRA weapons was almost reached at the end of last year, but foundered on demands from the DUP that the process by verified through photographs.Northern Ireland has seen a virtual end to more than 30 years of violence since the landmark 1998 Good Friday peace deal, but Dublin and London, as well as an independent monitoring body, have accused paramilitary groups of continued criminal activities.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern were to chair the first major review of the Northern Ireland situation since the British general election in May at a meeting in London later Monday.The talks, which will include senior ministers from both sides, were being held under the auspices of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC) which was set up under the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement.The discussions were to cover political developments in Northern Ireland, security and criminal justice matters, policing, the marching season involving the Protestant loyalist Orange Order, human rights and equality, cross-border matters in Ireland and Anglo-Irish questions.BIIGC meetings are normally only attended by the Irish foreign minister and the British secretary of state for Northern Ireland but there is provision to scale them up to ""summit level"" involving both prime ministers.""The holding of a meeting of the BIIGC at summit level is a demonstration of the close working and high level partnership between the two governments,"" the Irish government statement said.""It is also a demonstration of the commitment of the two governments to pursue progress across the range of issues embraced by the Good Friday agreement.""The London summit was taking place as all sides in Northern Ireland wait to see if the Protestant marching season passes peacefully and if the Irish Republican Army (IRA) will respond positively to an appeal from Gerry Adams, leader of its Sinn Fein political wing, to disarm and fully embrace democracy.Protestant factions in Northern Ireland are adamant that there can be no political progress toward a lasting peace settlement without a move by the IRA to end all criminal and paramilitary activity.Speaking to reporters earlier Monday, Blair repeated his call for republicans to unequivocally give up violence and commit themselves to wholly democratic methods.""I think it is going to be very difficult to persuade unionism of the sincerity of any republican move, which is why that move has got to be clear and bold,"" he said.""It's immensely important that they do make this move... If it is done and it is done genuinely and violence is genuinely given up, then the obligation then transfers to unionists to make sure that they drop their opposition to going into a power-sharing executive.""The IRA declared a ceasefire in its campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland before the 1998 peace deal, which largely ended 30 years of sectarian violence in the province.The agreement paved the way for a Protestant-Catholic power-sharing assembly that was suspended more than two years ago amid a crisis of confidence and allegations of IRA espionage.British and Irish efforts to revive power-sharing and secure a permanent settlement collapsed before Christmas after Sinn Fein rejected Protestant demands for photographic proof of weapons destruction.
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met Wednesday with British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Peter Hain and reaffirmed support for the implementation of the Good Friday accords.The 1998 Good Friday peace deal largely ended three decades of intercommunity violence in Northern Ireland and established a power-sharing executive and assembly.""The United States continues to support fully the British and Irish governments' efforts to implement the Good Friday Accords,"" State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said.The United States, he said, welcomed statements made this week by British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern that the key to moving forward was for the Irish Republican Army (IRA), Northern Ireland's main Catholic paramilitary group, to end all violence unequivocally.Blair and Ahern underlined their desire for the quick return of a self-governing Northern Ireland and urged the IRA to cooperate.They warned that such a government would only be achieved provided that peace prevailed in the British-ruled province.
Northern Ireland's peace process would receive a major boost if the Irish Republican Army responds positively to appeals to embrace political methods, a leading figure in the paramilitary group's political wing said Friday.""It would give much needed new momentum to the peace process,"" Sinn Fein chief negotiator Martin McGuinness told a summer school in the Irish Republic.""It is clear that a positive response from the IRA would have an immediate and enormous impact on the political situation.""In April, Since Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams made a direct appeal to IRA ""volunteers"" to give up all violence and adopt democratic methods, since then the Catholic paramilitary group has been holding meetings to discuss a response.""I fully support Gerry Adams' appeal and I sincerely hope that the IRA does respond to it positively,"" McGuinness said.The Irish and British governments hope for an answer before the August holiday period from the IRA, which declared a ceasefire in its campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland ahead of a 1998 Good Friday peace deal which largely ended 30 years of violence.McGuinness claimed a positive response would deal with the ""genuine concerns"" of Protestant unionists, who want Northern Ireland to remain part of Britain, and remove any excuse for unionist party leaders refusing to negotiate directly with Sinn Fein.He said it would also put ""enormous pressure"" on Northern Ireland's largest party, the hardline Democratic Unionist Party led by Ian Paisley, ""to come on board the peace process"" for the first time.""There is no alternative to sharing power with Irish republicans; there is no alterative to the all-Ireland architecture and the equality agenda of the Good Friday Agreement,"" McGuinness said.Protestant factions in Northern Ireland are adamant that there can be no political progress toward a lasting peace settlement without a move by the IRA to end all paramilitary and criminal activity and a decommissioning of its weapons arsenals.The 1998 peace deal paved the way for a Protestant-Catholic power-sharing assembly, but that was suspended more than two years ago amid allegations of IRA espionage.British and Irish efforts to revive power-sharing and secure a permanent settlement collapsed before Christmas after Sinn Fein rejected Protestant demands for photographic proof of IRA weapons destruction.
Three senior Sinn Fein leaders, including party president Gerry Adams, have stepped down from their posts on the ruling body of the party's Irish Republican Army military wing according to the Irish Independent newspaper on Saturday.The newspaper said Adams, chief negotiator Martin McGuinness and convicted gun-runner Martin Ferris who is an lawmaker in the Irish Republic's parliament have all resigned from the seven-man army council of the Catholic IRA paramilitary group.It says their posts have been filled by three men from Northern Ireland who are closely aligned to the Adams-McGuinness group pushing the movement onto a purely political path.The newspaper says none of the new appointees is a member of Sinn Fein but all are regarded within the Provisional republican movement as militarists with proven records.""The ground-breaking decision means that all links between the leadership of the political and military wings of the Provisional movement have been severed.""The changes in personnel are also seen as part of the ""sanitisation"" process within Sinn Fein as the party prepares to present itself as a democratic body that is ready to play a full part in political developments north and south of the border,"" the Independent says.In an unprecedented charge in January, Irish Justice Minister Michael McDowell claimed the three Sinn Fein men were leaders of both the political and military wings of the republican movement.However, in a joint statement the trio ""categorically"" denied they were members of the ruling body of the outlawed IRA and accused McDowell of abusing his office.The Independent says that in the wake of the London bombings, and with an increasingly hostile climate towards terrorist violence, the Provisional movement is understood to have decided that this is the right time to move into a new mode. Earlier this year, Adams has made a direct appeal to IRA ""volunteers"" to embrace purely political and democratic activity.The Irish and British governments hope for a response before the August holiday period from the IRA, which declared a ceasefire in its campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland before a 1998 peace deal which largely ended 30 years of violence.Protestant factions in Northern Ireland are adamant that there can be no political progress toward a lasting peace settlement without a move by the IRA to end all paramilitary and criminal activity and a decommissioning of weapons arsenals.The 1998 Good Friday peace deal paved the way for a Protestant-Catholic power-sharing assembly, but that was suspended more than two years ago amid allegations of IRA espionage.British and Irish efforts to revive power-sharing and secure a permanent settlement collapsed before Christmas after Sinn Fein rejected Protestant demands for photographic proof of IRA weapons destruction.
Northern Ireland's 7-year-old peace accord will eventually work but requires theIrish Republican Army to deliver a ""clear and decisive"" end to all itsactivities, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said Friday.In a speech to British and Irish academics at University College Dublin, Ahernsaid the U.S.-brokered Good Friday pact of 1998 contained a complex set of goalsthat, if achieved, would ensure a stable, peaceful Northern Ireland.But he said the pact's key goal _ a joint Catholic-Protestant administration _would be revived only ""in the context of a complete end to IRA paramilitarismand criminality and the putting beyond use of their weapons.""The major Protestant party, the Democratic Unionists, refuses to cooperate withSinn Fein, the IRA-linked party that represents most Catholics, citing the IRA'scontinued underground activities.Last month, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, a reputed IRA commander, appealed toIRA members to leave behind their ""armed struggle"" in favor of democraticpolitics.""We now need the IRA to deliver a clear and decisive response to Gerry Adams'recent appeal,"" Ahern said. ""I hope that this response will be translated intoclear reality on the ground.""
In an unusual show of agreement, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern and the Rev.Ian Paisley, the top Protestant politician in Northern Ireland, called Wednesdayfor the outlawed IRA to disarm and disband.Ahern and Paisley _ a hard-liner who opposes Irish involvement in NorthernIreland and didn't begin meeting Ahern until last year _ spoke separately aftera 90-minute meeting at the Irish embassy in London.They said the Irish Republican Army was standing in the way of revivedCatholic-Protestant cooperation in Northern Ireland. Both emphasized that theIRA must demonstrate its voluntary demise in concrete ways.Ahern said he was hopeful that the IRA would issue a declaration within the nextfew months spelling out whether it will disarm and cease all threateningactivities.""To move forward, we need a clear, unambiguous end of all paramilitary andcriminal activity and we need to see the completion of (weapons)decommissioning,"" Ahern said.But he stressed, ""It is not just words, it is deeds. If we get a statement onthe issues I have mentioned, we would be very happy with the statement. But wewould, naturally enough, want to see that they happen.""Northern Ireland's Good Friday peace accord of 1998 proposed the creation of ajoint Catholic-Protestant administration involving Sinn Fein, the IRA-linkedparty that represents most of the province's Catholics. Power-sharing collapsedin 2002 following chronic arguments over IRA activities and weaponry.Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party, which represents most of the territory'sBritish Protestant majority, says it won't cooperate with Sinn Fein unless theIRA backs up words with meaningful public action _ particularly the publicationof photos of its disarmament.The IRA rejected those terms in December and since has been implicated in astring of criminal scandals, including a world-record bank robbery, the knifeslaying of a Catholic man and a money-laundering network.Paisley emphasized Wednesday he would wait for at least six months following anIRA peace declaration to see whether the group followed through withdeeds.The IRA was supposed to have scrapped all of its stockpiled weapons by mid-2000in support of the Good Friday deal. Instead it began a secrecy-shrouded processin October 2001 and halted it in October 2003 still in possession of much of itsarsenal.""Everybody has their tongue out waiting for a statement from the IRA. We haven'tgot our tongues out. ... We are looking for action,"" Paisleysaid.Ahern was also meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has workedclosely with Ahern since 1997 to broker compromise in Northern Ireland, which isa part of the United Kingdom.
A Roman Catholic priest appealed Saturday to the Irish Republican Army to revealthe burial spots of more than a dozen people whose bodies have never beenfound.The Rev. Sean Dooley made his plea at the funeral of Gareth O'Connor, 24, an IRAdissident who disappeared in May 2003. Last weekend, police divers found hisbody still inside his car in a canal in Newry, 40 miles (65 kilometers) south ofBelfast.Police and O'Connor's family say IRA members killed him, probably because he hadbeen arguing with an IRA member over a money-raising racket the IRA was runningin South Armagh, a major power base for the outlawed group. The IRA has deniedinvolvement.At the time of his disappearance, O'Connor had been driving towards a policestation to report for bail in the neighboring Republic of Ireland, where he wasfacing trial for membership in a splinter group called the RealIRA.Dooley said the O'Connor family's ""worst has come to the worst,"" but therelatives of others slain by the IRA had not been allowed to lay their lovedones to rest.""I appeal to anybody who has any information about the disappeared to contacttheir families directly or indirectly so that other bodies may be cut down fromthe crosses and given Christian burials,"" Dooley told several hundred mournersat O'Connor's funeral Mass in St. Patrick's Cathedral in Newry.In a direct plea to those who killed more than a dozen IRA victims, mostly inthe 1970s and early 1980s, he asked, ""How can you go home to your families everynight knowing the hell these families are enduring?""The search for unmarked graves of IRA victims is one of many unfinished chaptersof Northern Ireland's peace process.The IRA in 1999 described the locations of eight burial spots to a jointBritish-Irish commission coordinating the search, but remains of only three IRAvictims have been found. The group has rejected responsibility for several otherlong-missing people abducted from IRA power bases in the 1970s.The IRA killed about 1,800 people from 1970 to 1997, when it called anopen-ended truce. Despite this, IRA members continue to administer cripplingbeatings _ and occasionally fatal shootings and stabbings _ to their criminalopponents in Catholic areas.
Any public pledge by the Irish Republican Army to cease all activities,including crime, should be weighed over time to test whether it's genuine, theBritish governor of Northern Ireland said Tuesday.Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Hain said the government was soon expecting theIRA to issue a new peace declaration that would address a long-standing demandfor the outlawed group to disarm fully and disband. He said until the IRA didthis, Protestant leaders would refuse to share power with Sinn Fein, theIRA-linked party that represents most Catholics.""For that trust to be restored there must be a clear, definitive and permanentend to paramilitary activity and its associated criminality,"" Hain said in aspeech to the annual conference of the Irish Congress of TradeUnions.""Words are not enough, but they are an important start, and I hope people wouldnot underestimate the significance of a credible statement from the IRA,"" hesaid.But in a nod to Protestant leaders' unwillingness to form a power-sharinggovernment immediately with Sinn Fein, Hain said an unspecified delay would bereasonable to determine whether the IRA was telling the truth.""A commitment in words needs to be capable of being verified over a period oftime so that everyone can see that the commitment is real and lasting,"" hesaid.
",The 1998 Good Friday peace accord was suspended in 2002 due to violent activity by the Irish Republican Army (IRA). An appeal in April 2005 by Sinn Fein leader Adams to the IRA to abandon armed struggle was endorsed in May by Irish Prime Minister Ahern. All interested parties awaited a response from the IRA. In late June the U.S. State Department supported British Prime Minister Blair's and Ahern's call for a response. In late July there was a first glimmer of hope as three senior Sinn Fein leaders resigned from the ruling body of IRA's military wing. ,"Irish PM Ahern said the main goal of the US-brokered Good Friday pact of 1998, a joint Catholic-Protestant administration in Northern Ireland, could be revived only with a complete end of IRA weapons use. The landmark peace deal led to a virtual end of violence in that area. Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams has appealed to IRA members to end their armed struggle in favor of democratic politics. Hopes are rising in Northern Ireland that the IRA will disarm. British PM Blair and Ahern will chair a review of the Northern Ireland situation in London. ","The US-brokered Good Friday pact of 1998 ended three decades of violence and created a power-sharing plan in Northern Ireland. It required a complete end to IRA paramilitarism and criminality, and decommissioning of IRA weapons. Power-sharing collapsed in 2002 following continued IRA underground activities. In 2005 Gerry Adams, leader of Catholic Sinn Fein, appealed to IRA members to give up violence in favor of democratic methods, followed by similar appeals by Irish PM Bertie Ahern and Protestant party leader Ian Paisley. Adams, Martin McGuinness and Martin Ferris resigned from the IRA paramilitary council, severing its political and military wings. ","The 1998 Good Friday Peace accord had proposed a joint Catholic-Protestant administration, including the Sinn Fein, for Northern Ireland. Although ending decades of fighting, power sharing collapsed in 2002 because of the Irish Republican Army's (IRA) - the military arm of the Sinn Fein - activities and failure to disarm. In 2005, British and Irish leaders sought to restore the power sharing institutions. Protestants insisted the IRA disband and disarm. Protestant leaders was urged to come onboard the peace process. On August 23, three Sinn Fein leaders resigned from leadership positions in the IRA, severing their military ties. "
D0909,D0909-B,"Hopes Northern Ireland's Irish Republican Army will make a long-awaited statement committing itself to democratic means were raised Tuesday as Ireland's deputy prime minister said she expected news later this week.Mary Harney, leader of the Progressive Democrat Party, the junior partner in Prime Minister Bertie Ahern's ruling coalition, said she hoped the IRA statement would see an end to ""criminality in Ireland in all its forms once and for all"".In April, Gerry Adams, the leader of the political wing of the IRA, Sinn Fein, made a direct appeal to the Roman Catholic paramilitary group to embrace purely political and democratic activity.The Irish and British governments had been hoping for a response to the call at some point during the summer.""I certainly hope it (the statement) will be substantial,"" Harney told Ireland's RTE state radio.""There have been many false dawns. I hope on this occasion that it is not a false dawn and that we can put the muddy past of paramilitarism totally and utterly behind us, and that everybody embraces politics and all that that involves -- peaceful politics and democratic politics.""The IRA, which declared a ceasefire in its campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland before the 1998 Good Friday peace deal that largely ended 30 years of violence, has been holding consultations with members.The Irish media has reported that three senior Sinn Fein leaders, including Adams and chief negotiator Martin McGuinness, have stepped down from their posts on the seven-man ruling body of the IRA.In an unprecedented charge in January, Irish Justice Minister Michael McDowell claimed the trio were leaders of both the political and military wings of the movement.However, in a joint statement the Sinn Fein leaders ""categorically"" denied they were members of the outlawed IRA's ruling body, and accused McDowell of abusing his office.Even if the IRA commits itself to ending violence, Northern Ireland could still be bogged down by the sort of factional bickering which saw a solution to the current political deadlock scuppered just before Christmas.Protestant factions in Northern Ireland, particularly the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) led by veteran hardliner Ian Paisley, are adamant that there can be no lasting settlement without a move by the IRA to end all paramilitary and criminal activity and to decommission its weapons.The Good Friday agreement paved the way for a Protestant-Catholic power-sharing assembly in Belfast, but that was suspended more than two years ago amid allegations of IRA espionage.Hopes of a new political settlement were dashed in December when moves to destroy IRA arms caches were halted following Protestant demands the process be photographed, something Sinn Fein rejected as an unnecessary humiliation.
Gerry Adams, the leader of the Sinn Fein political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), confirmed Thursday that the Roman Catholic paramilitary group was on the verge of making a significant statement.""The forthcoming IRA statement will challenge Irish Republicans (Sinn Fein) and nationalists (other Catholics). I appeal to everyone to carefully read what the army has to say and to remain united and steadfast,"" he said.""The IRA statement will also challenge others, especially the two governments and the (Protestant) Unionists,"" Adams said in a statement distributed by Sinn Fein in the Irish capital of Dublin.""The Dublin political establishment in particular will have a lot of soul searching to do, if those in the political leadership are to meet the needs of the upcoming period,"" Adams said, without elaborating.The underground guerrilla movement which has been fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland for 30 years is expected to respond to British-Irish calls for it to renounce violence once and for all.The appeal was reinforced on April 6 when Adams urged the IRA to take the ""historic"" decision to abandon the armed struggle and engage in a political process for peace in Northern Ireland.
The Irish Republican Army on Thursday ordered its militants to end its armed campaign in Northern Ireland, the paramilitary group said in a historic statement.It said IRA militants have been instructed to abandon their weapons and ""end the armed campaign.""
A spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony Blair welcomed Thursday what he called a ""very positive"" statement from the Irish Republican Army leadership to end its armed campaign in Northern Ireland.The spokesman welcomed the IRA leadership's clear call to ""end"" the armed campaign and renounce ""any other activities whatsoever,"" which he interpreted as an end to criminal activities.The second phrase ""is very important,"" the spokesman told AFP.Overall the statement ""is very positive,"" he added.
A historic pledge by the Irish Republican Army to lay down their arms and adopt peaceful means to end British rule in Northern Ireland took effect at 4:00 pm (1500 GMT) Thursday.The Roman Catholic paramilitary group, which has led a bloody campaign to unite mostly Protestant Northern Ireland with the Irish Republic for more than three decades, promised to end their armed struggle in an unprecedented statement released a few hours earlier.
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on Thursday hailed the Irish Republican Army (IRA)'s pledge to end its armed struggle for a united Northern Ireland and urged all parties to seize the opportunity to consolidate their power-sharing agreement.""The Secretary-General welcomes the announcement by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) that it has decided to end armed actions in Northern Ireland and disarm,"" Annan said through his spokesman, Stephane Dujarric. ""This decision, if fully implemented, will be a watershed in the history of Northern Ireland.""The IRA on Thursday ordered its militants to end the armed campaign in Northern Ireland and become a political movement, the paramilitary group said in a historic statement.But the statement said the organization would not disband as North Ireland's leading Protestants demand.Annan expressed the hope that IRA ""will commit fully to the obligation it has just undertaken"" and called ""on all parties concerned to seize this unique opportunity to consolidate the Good Friday (power-sharing) Agreement.
Senior figures in Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army-linked party, departedWednesday for the United States ahead of an expected major new peace declarationfrom the outlawed IRA.The British, Irish and U.S. governments have been pressing since December forthe IRA to disarm fully and disband in support of Northern Ireland's 1998 peaceaccord. The pact's key goal _ a joint Catholic-Protestant administration for theBritish territory _ has been hold since 2002 because of Protestant refusal tocooperate with Sinn Fein, the major Catholic-backed party.The British and Irish governments both expect the IRA to release a new policystatement soon, perhaps on Thursday, outlining its future intentions. Bothgovernments insist the IRA must disarm fully and renounce violence and criminalactivity _ commitments the IRA has refused to give in the past.Sinn Fein deputy leader Martin McGuinness and the party's North Americanrepresentative, Rita O'Hare, were planning to meet supporters in the U.S.Congress and President George W. Bush's envoy to Northern Ireland, MitchellReiss.In a sign of recent U.S. pressure on the Sinn Fein-IRA movement, O'Hare inFebruary was barred from traveling into the United States _ the first time thathappened since she became Sinn Fein's senior U.S.-based lobbyist in 1998. O'Harehas been on the run from British justice since the early 1970s in NorthernIreland, where she absconded on bail while awaiting trial on charge ofattempting to murder British soldiers.
The Irish Republican Army has renounced its armed struggle for aunited Ireland, agreeing to turn solely to political methods, anAmerican businessman said Tuesday after being briefed on a statementexpected from the guerrilla group later this week.The agreement, if borne out, would be a historic turning pointin the violent history of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Butthere is still widespread official skepticism about IRA promises, particularlywhen it comes to the issue of disarmament.Indeed, it was not immediately clear whether the IRA would addresshow several tons of arms, hidden in bunkers across Ireland,would be disposed of, according to the businessman, Niall O'Dowd,who brokered talks between the IRA and American officials thathelped lead to a cease-fire in 1994. The continued existenceof those weapons, which were to have been destroyed underan agreement reached after the cease-fire, contributed to the collapseof the Northern Ireland government in 2003.On Tuesday night, an Irish government spokesman said an IRA commitmentto nonviolence had to be backed by an unambiguous processfor disposing of all its weapons. ""The ultimate test isthe delivery on that,"" said the spokesman, who as amatter of routine practice spoke only on the condition thathe not be identified. A spokesman for the British governmentdeclined comment.A number of recent signs have pointed to major developments occurringwithin the IRA.On Tuesday, Ireland's justice minister, Michael McDowell, said the top leadersof the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, including Gerry Adamsand Martin McGuinness, had stepped down from positions on theIRA's secretive governing council.In addition, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland was cutting shorta vacation to return to Dublin later this week. JohnDeChastelain, a Canadian general who is the chairman of acommission set up to oversee the destruction of paramilitary weapons,is in Ireland this week, the Irish government spokesman said.And McGuinness is to go to Washington on Thursday tobrief American officials on the peace process, according to RitaO'Hare, Sinn Fein's representative in the United States.The developments follow a public appeal by Adams in April, inwhich he urged the republican movement to turn away fromviolent struggle and to devote all its energies to politics.Adams said he had justified the IRA's activities in thepast because no alternative existed for people who did notwish to submit to British authority.""That struggle can now be taken forward by other means,"" Adamssaid in a speech in Belfast. He asked, ""Can youtake courageous initiatives which will achieve your aims by purelypolitical and democratic activity?""O'Dowd, the publisher of a magazine, Irish America, and a newspaper,Irish Voice, said Adams and other senior republicans had persuadedthe IRA membership that it could succeed politically. Sinn Feinis now the second-largest party in Northern Ireland, and ithas made significant gains among voters in the Republic ofIreland since 1994.""This is a truly historic moment in Irish history,"" O'Dowd said.""It is the first time since the founding of theIrish state that the IRA has agreed that there shouldbe no armed struggle. Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness havetaken an armed revolutionary movement and succeeded in placing iton a political path. Irish history is littered with peoplesuch as Michael Collins, who tried to do the sameand failed.""However, the IRA's failure to disarm since 1994 has created muchofficial skepticism about its motives and statements.""There is no position whatsoever between being armed and being unarmedfor the IRA,"" said McDowell, the justice minister. ""If theIRA are decommissioning, they must decommission all their weapons intheir entirety, every single pistol, every single bullet, the lot.""
The Irish Republican Army declared an endto its campaign of violence against Britain that claimed morethan 3,500 lives over 36 years, saying there was ""analternative way to achieve"" its goal of a United Ireland.The announcement in a DVD released to reporters was taken inLondon as, potentially, a profound shift in Northern Ireland's destiny,reversing decades of Republican commitment to violence in the effortto end British rule.""This may be the day on which,finally, after all these false dawns and dashed hopes, peacereplaced war, politics replaces terror on the island of Ireland,""Prime Minister Tony Blair said in a televised statement inLondon. He also said the announcement ""creates the circumstances"" inwhich Northern Ireland's power-sharing local government could be revived. ""Thisis a step of unparalleled magnitude in the recent historyof Northern Ireland.""The Irish Prime Minister, Bertie Aherne, struck a more cautious note,saying the IRA statement would be momentous if the organizationmatched words with deeds.Among the troubling issues is whether the IRA will halt thecriminal operations -- such as armed robbery, smuggling and moneylaundering -- that fund the organization. The IRA said thatits members must not engage in any other activities whatsoever,but skeptics worry that the organization may break up intosmall independent crime gangs.The statement by the IRA said: ""Our decisions have been takento advance our republican and democratic objectives, including our goalof a united Ireland. We believe there is now analternative way to achieve this and to end British rulein our country.""""All IRA units have been ordered to dump arms,"" said thestatement, which was read out on a DVD by aformer prisoner, Seana Walsh.Blair said Unionists -- the IRA's foes -- would want toensure that the ""clear statement of principal is kept toin practice.""The widely expected statement could mark the conclusion of the bloodiestchapter in modern Irish history, foretold in 1994, when anIRA cease-fire began winding up the tradition of militant Irishrepublicanism. And it takes a step towards restoring Northern Ireland'slocal government, which was established under a 1998 peace accordbut suspended in 2002 due to allegations of IRA activity.GerryAdams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing ofthe IRA, said at a news conference in Dublin thatthe announcement could ""help revive the peace process"" and saidit was a challenge to the British and Irish governmentsas well as the Ulster Unionists to see that thepeace accord is carried out.Unionists, the province's largest political group who are mostly Protestant, arelikely to insist on a delay of at least ayear before returning to share seats in the provincial legislaturewith Sinn Fein. ""There are still a number of areasof loose ends,"" Jeffrey Donaldson, a Northern Irish member ofthe British parliament for the hard-line Democratic Unionists, told RTEradio. ""We'll probably need a period of time now overwhich we can judge whether what the IRA says iswhat they actually do.""(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)The statement came four months after Adams, who denies repeated reportsthat he has been an IRA commander, called on theguerrilla group to embrace purely political and democratic activity. TopSinn Fein representatives are in Washington, London and Brussels tobrief international leaders on the IRA decision.The loose ends include the possible continuation of IRA criminal operations.Police blame the IRA for crimes like the robbery of$50 million from a Belfast bank last December, and themurder of a Belfast man, Robert McCartney, in January, butno prosecutions have followed in either case.Mainstream politicians want Sinn Fein, and its IRA supporters, to endorseNorthern Ireland's fledgling police service, which has been revamped togain the trust of Roman Catholics, who suffered from discriminationin the past.Dismantling the IRA's massive stashes of weapons, which are mostly hiddenin underground bunkers in the countryside, has been the moststubborn obstacle to a functioning power-sharing system between Roman Catholicand Protestant political groups in Northern Ireland.The IRA has destroyed arms dumps on three separate occasions withthe cooperation of John DeChastelain, the retired Canadian general whoheads a commission supervising disarmament. But Unionist parties withdrew fromgovernment on several occasions after the 1998 pact in protestat the slow pace of the process.The IRA said on Wednesday that it would complete ""the processto verifiably put its arms beyond use"", and that itinvited Protestant and Catholic clergymen to serve as witnesses sothat disarmament can be completed ""as quickly as possible.""Analysts said that, based on DeChastelain's previous methods, the issue wouldlikely be dealt with in a matter of days. LastDecember, the Democratic Unionists, led by the firebrand preacher IanPaisley, scuttled an effort to restore Northern Ireland's government bydemanding photographic evidence that the arms had been destroyed, whichthe IRA refused.Paisley's party, which favors continued union with Britain, indicated it wouldtake months to negotiate a revival of Northern Ireland's power-sharingassembly.Even before the IRA statement was issued, Paisley told the BBC:""I am saying now the proof of the pudding isin the eating and digesting of it. We've heard itall before. You can wrap it up any way youlike, put a new bit of ribbon on the packagebut we want the action, the proof this is happening.""Paisley's party refuses to talk to Sinn Fein and says itis indistinguishable from the IRA.
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan hailed the decision of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) to disarm and end armed actions in Northern Ireland, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Thursday.In a statement issued by the spokesman, Annan said he welcomed the announcement by the IRA that it has decided to end armed actions in Northern Ireland and disarm.The Secretary-General believed this decision, if fully implemented, will be ""a watershed in the history of Northern Ireland,"" Dujarric said.Annan hoped the IRA will commit fully to the obligation it has just undertaken, and called on all parties concerned to seize thisunique opportunity to consolidate the Good Friday Agreement, the spokesman added.An IRA statement said on Thursday that it would put an end to its armed struggle and devote efforts towards peaceful solutions.
","On July 26 Ireland's deputy prime minister predicted news of a response from the IRA later in the week. The next day senior figures in Sinn Fein departed for the U.S. signaling a forthcoming announcement. An Irish government spokesman warned that an IRA commitment to non-violence had to be backed by an unambiguous process for disposing of all of its weapons. On July 29 the long-awaited statement arrived declaring that ""All IRA units have been ordered to dump arms."" U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan hailed the announcement while British Prime Minister Blair called it a ""very positive"" statement. ",IRA has reportedly renounced its armed struggle for a united Ireland. The disposal of IRA arms remains unclear. Adams did confirm that the Roman Catholic paramilitary group was on the verge of making a significant statement. Ahern remained cautious and Northern Ireland Protestant leader Ian Paisley requires absolute proof. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan hailed the decision and Blair called the statement very positive. The IRA pledge to lay down its arms and adopt peaceful means to end British rule in Northern Ireland took effect at 4:00 PM on July 28. ,"American businessman Niall O'Dowd brokered IRA-US talks leading to a 1994 cease-fire. The 1998 accord established Northern Ireland's local government. In December 2004 Sinn Fein rejected Protestant demands that IRA arms destruction be photographed, halting political progress. Following Gerry Adams' April 2005 appeal to lay down arms the IRA consulted with members. Sinn Fein leaders visited the US but entry was denied to fugitive Rita O'Hare. In July the IRA declared an end to violence. It ordered all its units to dump arms, inviting Protestant and Catholic clergymen to serve as witnesses. The IRA refused to disband as Protestants demanded. ","In late August, the IRA ordered an end to its armed campaign in Northern Ireland, declaring there is an alternate way to achieve a united Ireland, free from British rule. If this pledge holds, it will be a historic turning point in the violent history of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The majority Protestant party is expected to demand a one year delay in power sharing. Other remaining questions are will the IRA end criminal operations, will the Catholics support the new police, and will the promised destruction of the massive IRA weapons stash occur. World leaders praised the IRA order. "

","In October 2004, Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebel group blamed the government for delay in reviving negotiations to end the conflict that had claimed 60,000 lives since 1972. The rebels themselves suspended talks in April 2003 when internecine struggles broke out between rebel groups. The government claims the Tigers are holding up negotiations and accuses them of killing over 250 of their political rivals since the truce of 2002 went into effect. The government released ten Tamil Tigers from jail on bail, and the rebels responded by freeing two homeguards who had been held hostage since August. ","Negotiations under the Norwegian-sponsored peace process of February 2002 between The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the government of Sri Lanka were at a standstill in October 2004 due in part to internecine struggles within the LTTE. The main LTTE in northern Sri Lanka was challenged by a faction in the east with a leader known as Karuma who broke ranks in March 2004. While LTTE sought support in Europe and Japan offered help in resumption of negotiations, Sri Lanka blamed LTTE for breakdown of the peace process which has been stalled since April 2003. ","A group from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam met in Switzerland to prepare for talks with the Sri Lankan government. A cease in that country brokered by Norway has been observed since February 2002; however, internecine clashes between the LTTE and rival groups counter efforts to revive negotiations between the government and the LTTE. The Sri Lankan government has sent counterproposals to the Interim Self Government to those put forward by the LTTE. Violence continues and a Swiss national was killed. Japanese envoy Akashi was to arrive in Sri Lanka to push for resumption of talks. ","Efforts to revive talks between the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil Tiger rebels have been stalled by persistent clashes between rival rebel groups and by continued killings. In early October the top rebel group was in Switzerland to prepare for the next round of talks, while the government said that it had finalized a set of counter proposals for the resumption of direct negotiations. Japan's special envoy arrived in Sri Lanka on 27 October for a 7-day visit to encourage an early resumption of peace talks. Japan is optimistic and has promised continued assistance for the country's reconstruction. "

Sri Lanka's government Friday accused Tamil Tiger guerrillas ofbreaking a Norwegian-arranged ceasefire by killing a governmentsoldier and a military informant.The government said in a statement that Thursday's killing of asoldier from the military intelligence unit and an informant had allthe ""hallmarks"" of the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).""This is a direct violation of the ceasefire agreement which calls onthe parties not to engage in assassinations,"" the statement said.""The continuing violations cast doubts on the seriousness of thecommitment of the LTTE.""The statement said it also raised doubts about the LTTE's interest inobserving the Norwegian-led peace initiative aimed at ending threedecades of ethnic bloodshed.Unidentified gunmen shot dead the two men in the island's eastThursday.The attackers opened fire as the victims rode a motorcycle in thedistrict of Polonnaruwa, the officials said, adding thatinvestigations were under way to track down the killers.There was no immediate claim of responsibility.The military has blamed similar attacks on the Tamil Tigers.The government has accused the Tigers of killing more than 250rivals, including military informants, since the Norwegian-brokeredceasefire went into effect from February 23, 2002.

","Japanese and Norwegian diplomats visited Sri Lanka in October 2004 in an effort to persuade the government and Tamil Tiger rebels to resume negotiations toward an end to hostilities. The Tigers insisted they had not given up their right to secede, although they agreed to explore federal solutions. Increasing violence preceding the visit of the Norwegian foreign minister forced the government to heighten security measures. The Tigers blamed the violence on elements who wanted to discredit them. In November, the government accused Tamil Tigers of breaking a Norwegian-arranged ceasefire by killing a government soldier and a military informant. ","A special Japanese envoy met with the Sri Lankan government 27-30 Oct. and on Nov. 1 left for the north for talks with LTTE. Norwegian Foreign Minister Petersen, preceded by violence and increased security, arrived in Colombo on Nov. 9 in a fresh attempt to revive peace talks. Petersen said he did not have ""high expectations."" LTTE announced on Nov. 16 that it was prepared to start peace talks on the basis of its proposed Self-Governing Authority. Petersen's lack of ""high expectations"" was borne out by outbreaks of violence in eastern Sri Lanka Nov. 17-22. ",Japanese envoy Akashi ended talks with the government and awaits meeting with LTTE leaders hoping to salvage the peace process. Japan is Sri Lanka's largest donor and supports the Norwegian-backed peace process. The peace process was officially blocked over differences on an agenda but diplomats say the split among Tamil Tigers could be the real reason.

D0911,D0911-A,"Chess legend Bobby Fischer, who faces prison if he returns to the United States, can only avoid deportation from Japan if Iceland upgrades its granting of residency to full citizenship, a Japanese lawmaker said Wednesday.Mizuho Fukushima, head of the opposition Social Democratic Party, told a press conference that Japanese immigration officials are opting to deport Fischer to the United States unless Iceland grants him nationality.Fischer, 62, known for his maverick behavior and outspoken criticism of his country, may face 10 years in prison if convicted of violating US sanctions imposed on the former Yugoslavia by playing there in 1992.Fukushima met Masaharu Miura, chief of the justice ministry's immigration bureau, who had told parliament Tuesday that the chess genius could only be deported to his country of origin -- the United States.The socialist leader said of the prospect of Fischer going to Iceland: ""Mr Miura told us that it would be okay if Iceland gives him citizenship.""The Social Democratic Party will bring up the issue at the parliament and will work to let the Japanese public know about the case,"" she said.Iceland has offered residency to Fischer, who is famous in Reykjavik for dethroning the Soviet Boris Spassky there in 1972 at the height of the Cold War.Iceland has sent him a passport which shows residency status but it has not offered him nationality.Socialist leader Fukushima, who is also a well-known human rights lawyer, is scheduled to meet the Icelandic ambassador on Thursday.Fischer's supporters accuse the United States of piling pressure both on Japan and Iceland so it can get ahold of the chess legend.The supporters say Fischer would not receive a fair trial in the United States due to his controversial past statements, such as hailing the September 11, 2001 attacks as ""wonderful news"" and anti-Jewish remarks.""Mr Fischer would be free if he were not Mr Fischer,"" said Masako Suzuki, his lawyer.But even if Iceland offered Fischer citizenship, his case would still be in legal limbo because of his US nationality.An immigration official at the justice ministry said that a person with two nationalities is usually deported to the country whose passport he or she used to enter Japan. That would mean the United States for Fischer.Fischer has been held since July when he attempted to fly out of Japan on an allegedly invalid US passport, but from detention he has been unable to renounce his US citizenship.A renunciation would make him a man without a country. He has sought political asylum in Japan and applied for a German passport on account of his German father, but neither route has been successful.Fukushima said justice ministry officials told her that they had not discussed Fischer's case with their US nor Icelandic counterparts, after opposition allegations that Japan was caving in to US pressure.Fischer is little known in Japan. The media has largely ignored his plight even though in detention he became engaged to the head of the Japan Chess Association.
Chess legend Bobby Fischer was on Monday granted citizenship by the parliament of Iceland, a move which could allow him to avoid deportation from Japan to the United States where he is wanted for violating sanctions against the former Yugoslavia.""It is done. The decision is valid from today,"" Atli Gislason, a deputy from the Left-Green movement, told AFP.Fischer, 62, who is in detention in Japan, faces prison if he returns to the United States.The former grandmaster, known for his maverick behavior and outspoken criticism of the United States, may face 10 years in prison if convicted of violating US sanctions imposed on the former Yugoslavia by playing there in 1992.But last week Mizuho Fukushima, head of the Japanese opposition Social Democratic Party, told a press conference that Japanese immigration officials would not deport Fischer to the United States if Iceland grants him nationality.All 40 members of parliament who cast their votes were in favour of the motion to grant Fischer citizenship, while two deputies abstained, and 21 were absent.Iceland had previously sent Fischer a passport which showed residency status but not full nationality, a document not deemed sufficient to save him from deportation to the United States.Fischer's link to Iceland dates back to 1972, when he defeated Russian Boris Spassky in a world championship match, which ended a long domination of the game by Soviet players and was hailed as a Cold War victory in his native United States.He was taken into custody in Japan last July for trying to leave the country on an invalid US passport.
Chess genius Bobby Fischer, now in a Japanese detention cell awaitingdeportation to the United States, will be allowed to leave Japan for Iceland ifthat country grants him citizenship, an opposition party leader saidWednesday.Mizuho Fukushima, head of the Social Democratic Party, said senior immigrationofficials told her that Fischer could go to Iceland instead of the United Statesif he is given citizenship there. Fischer is wanted by Washington for violatingeconomic sanctions against the former Yugoslavia when he played a high-profilechess match at a resort there in 1992.""They said that if he had citizenship, there would be no problem,"" she saidafter the meeting with immigration officials. Fukushima, a member of Parliament,later met with Iceland's ambassador to Tokyo.Iceland recently issued Fischer a special passport and residence permit to helpresolve the standoff over his status. Fischer became world chess champion in a1972 match in Iceland against the Soviet Union's Boris Spassky, and some of hisIcelandic supporters have campaigned to help him out of gratitude for puttingIceland in the global spotlight.The Iceland passport is one used by foreigners, however. Iceland's parliamentvoted two weeks ago against granting Fischer citizenship, and it's unclearwhether lawmakers plan to reconsider this.""The decision on citizenship lies with Parliament,"" said Illugi Gunnarsson, anadvisor to the Foreign Minister David Oddsson.Since being taken into custody in July for allegedly trying to leave the countryon a revoked U.S. passport, Fischer has lived up to his reputation asunpredictable.He has repeatedly denounced the U.S. deportation order as politically motivated,demanded refugee status, unilaterally renounced his U.S. citizenship and said hewants to become a German national instead. He has also applied to marry aJapanese woman who heads this country's chess association and is his longtimecompanion.Officials, meanwhile, have taken a hard line with him.Fischer, 62, is being held in detention just outside Tokyo pending the outcomeof a lawsuit challenging the deportation order. Officials say they do not knowhow much longer that could take. Most detainees at the center are deported orallowed to leave Japan within about one month, but Fischer has been in custodyfor eight months.Fukushima said Fischer, an outspoken critic of the U.S. government, was beingtreated unfairly.""There is no need to keep him in detention,"" she said. ""If this was any otherperson, I'm sure it would have turned out differently.""Her protest came after a member of Japan's leading opposition party, theDemocrats, grilled government officials in Parliament over the case. Fukushimasaid her party also intended to pursue the issue further in parliamentarydebate.During questioning in Parliament on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimuradenied allegations Tokyo is trying to please the United States by beingtough.""I do not recall being asked by the United States to do anything about Fischer,""Machimura told the committee. ""So I don't think the Justice Ministry isinterpreting the law out of consideration for the United States.""
Lawmakers in Iceland are likely to grant citizenship to mercurial chess geniusBobby Fischer, a member of a parliamentary committee studying the issue saidWednesday.Legislator Gudrun Ogmundsdottir told The Associated Press that a citizenshipmotion would probably be approved by the nine-member committee on Thursday. Ifit passes, it will go before Iceland's 63-member parliament, theAlthingi.""I think that parliament may approve of the citizenship as early as tomorrow,""said Ogmundsdottir, a member of the opposition Alliance Party.""Somebody would then go over to Japan with the passport, which would enable himto travel here or anywhere in the world,"" she added.Fischer, 62, is in a Japanese detention cell awaiting deportation to the UnitedStates, where he is wanted for violating economic sanctions against the formerYugoslavia by playing a highly publicized chess match there in1992.Mizuho Fukushima, leader of Japan's opposition Social Democratic Party, saidsenior immigration officials told her that Fischer would be allowed to go toIceland if he is given citizenship there.There is widespread support for Fischer in Iceland, where he played the SovietUnion's Boris Spassky in a world championship match in 1972.Iceland's parliament voted last month against granting Fischer citizenship,offering him a special foreigners' passport and residence permit instead. ButJapanese officials have so far declined to release Fischer.Several Icelandic politicians indicated Wednesday that parliament was now likelyto grant Fischer citizenship.""I can't speak for the whole party, but think few if any members of Parliamentare opposed to granting Fischer citizenship,"" said Drifa Hjartardottir, alawmaker with the Independence Party, which governs as part of Iceland'scoalition government.""We will not stand in the way of Fischer getting citizenship and want this issueto be resolved as quickly as possible,"" said Ogmundur Jonasson, a lawmaker withthe Left-Green opposition party. ""The worst thing we can do, both for Icelandand for Fischer, is to wait any longer.""Since being taken into custody in July for allegedly trying to leave Japan on arevoked U.S. passport, Fischer has lived up to his reputation forunpredictability.He has repeatedly denounced the U.S. deportation order as politically motivated,demanded refugee status, unilaterally renounced his U.S. citizenship and said hewants to become a German national instead. He has also applied to marry aJapanese woman who heads this country's chess association and is his longtimecompanion.Einar S. Einarsson, the former CEO of Visa Iceland who is one of Fischer's mostfervent supporters, said he was optimistic.""We're meeting them at 9:40 tomorrow and we want them to take the final step,""he said. ""It's been like a chess game and there's only one move left beforecheckmate.""
A parliamentary committee met here Thursday to discuss granting citizenship toBobby Fischer, but made no decision, saying it needed more information fromJapan, where the mercurial chess genius is being held in custody.Legislator Gudrun Ogmundsdottir had said the citizenship motion would probablybe passed by the nine-member committee Thursday, then be placed before Iceland's63-member parliament, the Althingi.But during Thursday's meeting the committee said it was awaiting more documentsfrom Japan to be sure he would be let go if given citizenship in Iceland. If so,an Icelandic passport would be delivered to Fischer in Japan, enabling him totravel wherever he wanted.The parliamentary committee is expected to meet again soon.Fischer, 62, is in a Japanese detention cell awaiting deportation to the UnitedStates, where he is wanted for violating economic sanctions against the formerYugoslavia by playing a highly publicized chess match there in1992.Mizuho Fukushima, leader of Japan's opposition Social Democratic Party, saidsenior immigration officials told her that Fischer would be allowed to go toIceland if he is given citizenship there.There is widespread support for Fischer in Iceland, where he played the SovietUnion's Boris Spassky in a world championship match in 1972.Iceland's parliament voted last month against granting Fischer citizenship,offering him a special foreigners' passport and residence permit instead.

Iceland's parliament voted Monday to grant Icelandic citizenship tothe American chess champion Bobby Fischer, laying the groundwork, hissupporters said, for his release from the Japanese prison wherehe has been detained since last summer.""We are most happy,"" said Einar S. Einarsson, spokesman for acommittee that has been fighting to allow Fischer to leaveJapan, where he is being held in prison while hefights deportation to the United States. Einarsson, who called Fischer""part of our modern saga and part of our recenthistory,"" said that the 62-year-old chess champion might be released""in only a few days"" and that an Icelandic delegationplanned to travel to Tokyo to escort him back toReykjavik.Monday's vote appears to be a resolution -- of sorts --to the curious legal limbo that Fischer fell into in1992, when, the U.S. government says, he violated economic sanctionsagainst the former Yugoslavia by accepting a $3.3 million feeto play an exhibition match there that year.After that, the always reclusive, progressively more eccentric Fischer dropped outof sight, living in Budapest and, possibly, the Philippines andSwitzerland. Now and then he emerged on radio stations inIceland, Hungary and the Philippines to rant, in increasingly belligerentterms, against the United States and against Jews.He surfaced in earnest in July 2004, when he attempted toboard a plane from Japan to Manila and was seizedby the Japanese authorities. He was accused of trying toleave the country without a valid passport. Since then hehas been held in prison while various governments, as wellas a staunch group of supporters from the chess world,have tried to find a resolution to what has proveda vexing and delicate jurisdictional issue.But while the United States -- which is also investigating thepossibility of charging him with tax evasion -- regards Fischeras a fugitive from justice, in Iceland he is seenas a national hero. It was in Reykjavik in 1972that he defeated the Russian world champion, Boris Spassky, inan electrifying Cold War chess contest that pitted east againstwest.Just as the African-American track star Jesse Owens' triumph over Hitler'sAryan athletes did at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, Fischer's victoryin Iceland seemed to symbolize nothing less than the triumphof one way of life over another -- in thiscase, democracy over Communism.It is partly for that reason, said Bjarni Benediktsson, chairman ofthe parliamentary committee, who last week recommended that Fischer begranted Icelandic citizenship, that the full parliament voted in favorof his request on Monday. Iceland had already agreed toissue a resident's permit and special passport to Fischer, butthese alone did not prove enough for the Japanese authorities.Fischer's supporters said they had received assurances from Japan that, withfull Icelandic citizenship and passport, he would be free toleave the country.""It was very clear from the outset that he had agreat influence here,"" Benediktsson said of Fischer, speaking by telephonefrom Reykjavik. ""A new generation of international chess players wasborn here in Iceland after the world championship match inReykjavik, and it was very clear from the outset ofthis matter that the authorities in Iceland have very warmfeelings toward this memory.""Benediktsson emphasized that the granting of citizenship was considered only asa last resort, ""after the applicant had exhausted all otherpossibilities"" of gaining freedom. He also said that Fischer's ""personalopinions on social issues"" had not entered into his government'sdecision.In a telephone interview, Einarsson played down the significance of Fischer'sreputation for misanthropy and his habit of making incendiary publicremarks.""Everyone knows his views, and he doesn't need to repeat themagain,"" Einarsson said. ""He's like Rembrandt or Mozart, one ofthese very big people, so his personality is beside thepoint.""Einarsson said that Fischer was likely to make Iceland his home,at least for the time being. ""I think he willstay in Iceland a lot, at least for the comingmonths, and then he will travel freely around the world-- although I don't expect he will be going toAmerica.""
Iceland's Parliament voted Monday to grant Icelandic citizenship tothe American chess star Bobby Fischer, laying the groundwork, hissupporters said, for his release from the Japanese prison wherehe has been held since last summer.""We are most happy,"" said Einar Einarsson, a spokesman for acommittee that has been trying to free Fischer from Japan,where he is being detained while he fights deportation tothe United States.Einarsson, who called Fischer ""part of our modern saga and partof our recent history,"" said Fischer, the 62-year-old chess champion,might be released ""in only a few days"" and thatan Icelandic delegation planned to travel to Tokyo to escorthim back to Reykjavik.In Washington, the State Department had no comment on the case,although a spokesman noted that renunciation of American citizenship didnot allow citizens to escape prosecution of crimes in theUnited States.Monday's vote appears to be a resolution of sorts to thecurious legal limbo that Fischer fell into in 1992 when,the United States says, he violated economic sanctions against Yugoslaviaby accepting a $3.3 million fee to play an exhibitionmatch there. After that, the always reclusive, progressively more difficultFischer dropped out of sight, living in Budapest -- andpossibly the Philippines and Switzerland -- and emerging now andthen on radio stations in Iceland, Hungary and the Philippinesto rant in increasingly belligerent terms against the United Statesand against Jews.This latest episode began in July 2004, when he tried toboard a plane from Japan to Manila and was seizedby the Japanese authorities and accused of trying to leavethe country on an invalid passport. He has been heldin prison since then while the various governments, as wellas a staunch group of supporters in the chess world,have tried to find some resolution to what has beena vexing and delicate jurisdictional issue.But while the United States -- which is also investigating thepossibility of charging him with tax evasion -- regards Fischeras a fugitive from justice, in Iceland he is seenas a national hero. It was in Reykjavik in 1972that he defeated the Russian world champion, Boris Spassky, inan electrifying Cold War chess contest that pitted East againstWest. As much as the African-American track star Jesse Owens'defeat of Hitler's Aryan athletes did at the 1936 BerlinOlympics, Fischer's victory in Iceland seemed to symbolize nothing lessthan the triumph of one way of life over another-- in this case, democracy over communism.It is partly for that reason, said Bjarni Benediktsson, chairman ofthe parliamentary committee that recommended last week that Fischer begranted Icelandic citizenship, that Parliament voted in favor of hisrequest on Monday. Iceland had already agreed to issue aresident's permit and special passport to Fischer, but that hadnot proved enough for the Japanese authorities.His supporters said they had received assurances from Japan that withfull Icelandic citizenship and passport, Fischer would be free toleave the country.""It was very clear from the outset that he had agreat influence here,"" Benediktsson said of Fischer, speaking by telephonefrom Reykjavik. ""A new generation of international chess players wasborn here in Iceland after the world championship match inReykjavik, and it was very clear from the outset ofthis matter that the authorities in Iceland have very warmfeelings toward this memory.""He emphasized that the granting of citizenship was considered only asa last resort, ""after the applicant had exhausted all otherpossibilities"" of gaining freedom. He also said Fischer's ""personal opinionson social issues"" had not been a factor.In Tokyo, the Committee to Free Bobby Fischer praised the IcelandicParliament, saying it had ""made history by standing up tothe earth's sole superpower.""""This is a historic battle pitting the world's sole superpower-bully againstone lone man who had the courage to fight forhis own freedom to think and speak as he chooses,""John Bosnitch, chairman of the group, said in a statement.In a telephone interview, Einarsson played down the significance of Fischer'sreputation for misanthropy and his habit of making incendiary publicremarks. ""Everyone knows his views, and he doesn't need torepeat them again,"" he said. ""He's like Rembrandt or Mozart-- one of these very big people -- so hispersonality is beside the point.""He said Fischer was likely to make Iceland his home, atleast for the time being. ""I think he will stayin Iceland a lot, at least for the coming months,and then he will travel feely around the world --although I don't expect he will be going to America.""
","Bobby Fischer, the former chess grand master, was arrested in 2005 for trying to leave Japan on a revoked U.S. passport. Japan planned to deport him to the U.S., where he was wanted for ignoring sanctions against Yugoslavia. It meant 10 years in jail. Iceland intervened, and Japan agreed not to deport Fischer if Iceland would give him citizenship. Iceland furnished him a special passport and residency permit. Japan insisted on full citizenship, which was finally granted. Iceland revered Fischer because it was there that he defeated Boris Spassky, the Russian chess champion, in 1972, during the cold war. ","Bobby Fischer, held in detention in Japan in March 2005 awaiting deportation to the U.S., could achieve asylum in Iceland if granted Icelandic citizenship. He was given residency status, but Iceland's parliament had rejected citizenship in February. Several Icelandic politicians indicated on March 16 that parliament was likely to grant citizenship. A parliamentary committee which reached no decision on March 17 saying they were awaiting more documents from Japan, voted in favor of citizenship on March 18. On March 21 parliament voted in favor 40-0 with two abstentions and 21 absent. ","Chess legend Bobby Fischer has been held in detention in Japan for eight months after trying to leave Tokyo on a revoked US passport. He faces deportation and prison in the US for violating sanctions on the former Yugoslavia by playing there in 1992. Supporters worked to secure his passage to Iceland, where he is revered as a national hero for beating Boris Spassky there in 1972. Iceland's parliament granted Fischer a foreigner's passport and a residency permit. But, that was not enough. After receiving assurance that Icelandic citizenship would enable Japan to free Fischer, parliament granted it to him. ","Bobby Fischer can avoid deportation from Japan to the US if Iceland upgrades its granting residency to full citizenship. Fischer is popular in Iceland where he beat the Soviet Union's Boris Spassky to become world chess champ in 1972. Fischer faces charges in the US for violating sanctions imposed on the former Yugoslavia for playing there in 1992, and possibly for tax evasion. Fischer wants to marry the head of Japan's chess association. Since leaving the US, Fischer has ranted against the US and Jews. The Icelandic Parliament has granted citizenship to Fischer where he is expected to reside. "

""I think you will be surprised if you see him.""Watai, who heads the Japan Chess Association, became engaged to Fischer after his detention.She said she planned to move with Fischer to Iceland once he is released.""We will later consider if our marriage procedures will resume in Iceland as the procedures have been suspended,"" she said.Japanese authorities have not accepted their marriage request, as the groom was in custody at the time of application.
The State Department expressed disappointment Tuesday over Iceland's move to grant citizenship to chess legend Bobby Fischer that could allow him to avoid a US prison sentence.Fischer, currently detained in Japan, faces 10 years in prison in the United States for playing a 1992 chess match in Yugoslavia in defiance of US sanctions imposed over the Balkan wars.But plans to ship him back to his native country became clouded after the parliament in Iceland, where he played an epic match in 1972, voted Monday to grant him citizenship.""It's an arrangement that we're disappointed by,"" deputy State Department spokesman Adam Ereli told reporters. ""Mr. Fischer is a fugitive from justice. There's a federal warrant for his arrest.""He's being detained in Japan, awaiting deportation. And that's the step that we're looking forward to,"" Ereli said.Japan said Tuesday it may let the 62-year-old Fischer leave for Iceland.
Iceland said Wednesday it hoped to give detained chess legend Bobby Fischer a passport before the weekend after granting him citizenship in a move that could allow him to avoid a US prison term.Icelandic Ambassador to Japan Thordur Oskarsson told AFP that Iceland formally presented documents Wednesday to Japan's foreign and justice ministries confirming the US-born genius's Icelandic citizenship.On issuing him an Icelandic passport, the ambassador said: ""I would say we want to deliver to him before the weekend.""""The passport is almost ready, but no exact time has been fixed,"" Oskarsson said, adding it would be issued at the Icelandic embassy in Tokyo.Fischer, 62, known for his eccentric behavior and outspoken criticism of the United States, has been detained in Japan since July when he tried to fly out of Tokyo to the Philippines on his revoked US passport.If he returns to the United States, he will face 10 years in prison over a chess game in 1992 in Yugoslavia in defiance of US sanctions imposed over the Balkan wars.Iceland had earlier sent him a passport which showed residency status but not full nationality, a document not deemed sufficient to save him from deportation to the United States.The chess legend is famous in Iceland for a 1972 match against Boris Spassky, then a Soviet citizen, in the capital Reykjavik at the height of the Cold War.On Monday, with Japan looking set to deport Fischer, the parliament in Iceland voted to grant Fischer citizenship.Japan's Justice Minister Chieko Noono said Tuesday it was ""legally possible"" to send Fischer to Iceland as long as he gets Icelandic citizenship.The US government expressed disappointment over Iceland's move, calling Fischer a ""fugitive from justice"" who had a federal warrant for his arrest.Supporters of Fischer, who is staying at the Ushiku immigration lock-up northeast of Tokyo, have said he has lost weight and become ragged in detention, growing a long beard. He was placed into solitary confinement for four days earlier this month in a tussle with guards over an egg.
After nearly nine months in a Japanese detention cell, chess legend BobbyFischer appeared to have cleared the final hurdle on his way to freedom Tuesday_ but Japan's government wasn't immediately ceding defeat.In a major breakthrough for Fischer, who is being held for allegedly travelingon a revoked U.S. passport, Iceland's parliament on Monday granted the formerworld champion and notorious eccentric full citizenship, opening the way for himto leave Japan for that country.Masako Suzuki, one of Fischer's lawyers, said that she expected Fischer to bereleased within the week. ""Unless something very unexpected happens, that wouldbe the natural course of events,"" she said.Iceland is where Fischer won the world championship in 1972, defeating BorisSpassky of the Soviet Union in a classic Cold War showdown that propelledFischer to international stardom.Bolstered by the news, supporters visited Fischer at the immigration detentioncenter where he remained in custody on the outskirts of Tokyo. Miyoko Watai, hislongtime companion, said Fischer was ""very happy"" after hearing thenews.Japanese Justice Minister Chieko Nono was quoted on the daily Yomiuri Shimbun'sWeb site as saying that if Fischer has been granted Icelandic citizenship, itwould be ""legally possible to deport him to that country. We will consider (thepossibility).""Following his arrest in July at Tokyo's Narita airport, Fischer and his team oflawyers had fought an order that he be deported to the United States, where heis wanted for violating international sanctions against the former Yugoslavia byplaying a high-profile, and lucrative, exhibition match.Fischer, 62, has since lived up to his reputation as unpredictable _ he has saidhe wants to unilaterally renounce his U.S. citizenship, demanded politicalrefugee status and announced that he intends to marry Watai, who heads Japan'schess federation.None of the moves swayed Japanese officials, however, who took an increasinglyhard-line position with him.Fischer's fight took a major turn for the better this month, when a delegationof Icelandic supporters visited him and pushed officials to allow his release.Iceland's government granted him a special passport, and, when Tokyo indicatedthat wasn't enough, on Monday granted him full citizenship.The process still required a formal presidential signature, which was expectedlater Tuesday, Suzuki said.""It is clear that there is no need to detain him anymore,"" she said. ""He wantsto leave Japan immediately.""Fischer became an icon when he dethroned Spassky in a series of games inReykjavik to claim America's first world chess championship in more than acentury.But a few years later he refused to defend the title against another Soviet,Anatoly Karpov. He then fell into obscurity before resurfacing to play anexhibition rematch against Spassky in the former Yugoslavia in1992.Fischer won the rematch on the resort island of Sveti Stefan. But the match wasplayed in violation of U.S. sanctions imposed to punish then-President SlobodanMilosevic. If convicted, Fischer, who hasn't been to the United States sincethen, could face 10 years in prison and a fine of US$250,000(euro190,000).A federal grand jury in Washington is also investigating possiblemoney-laundering charges involving Fischer, Richard J. Vattuone, one of hislawyers, said this month.Fischer was reported to have received US$3.5 million from the Spassky rematch.He boasted at the time that he didn't intend to pay any income tax on thewinnings.It wasn't immediately clear if going to Iceland would help Fischer avoidextradition to the United States if he is charged. The two countries have anextradition treaty.""If the United States wants to charge Bobby with something now, 13 years afterthe event, they are welcome to do so,"" John Bosnitch, head of the Free BobbyFischer Committee, told reporters at a news conference.Though a recluse over the past decade, Fischer has emerged from silence in radiobroadcasts and on his Web page to express anti-Semitic views and rail againstthe United States.His supporters say he is being hounded because of his strongly anti-U.S.government views.""As he did when he won the world chess championship in 1972, Bobby has shownthat individual freedom will always win,"" Bosnitch said earlier in astatement.
Chess legend Bobby Fischer could leave his Japanese detention cell by theweekend, his supporters said Tuesday, a day after Iceland's parliament voted togrant him citizenship.Backers in Iceland, where Fischer played a historic series of matches againstBoris Spassky of the former Soviet Union in 1972, rallied to Fischer's aid afterJapanese immigration authorities detained him last July and ordered him deportedto the United States. Tokyo alleges he was attempting to board a plane for thePhilippines with an invalid U.S. passport.On Monday, Iceland's parliament awarded the erratic former chess championcitizenship with a vote of 40 in favor and two abstaining.Masako Suzuki, one of Fischer's lawyers, said she expected Fischer would bereleased within the week. ""Unless something very unexpected happens, that wouldbe the natural course of events,"" she said.Fischer's Icelandic citizenship still needs a presidential signature for it tobecome final, but that was expected Tuesday, Suzuki said.""It is clear that there is no need to detain him anymore,"" she said. ""He wantsto leave Japan immediately.""Fischer, 62, is fighting a deportation order to the United States, where he iswanted for violating sanctions imposed on the former Yugoslavia by playing anexhibition match against Spassky there in 1992. He has instead asked to be sentto Iceland.Tokyo has so far refused, saying Japanese law only allows for Fischer'sdeportation to a country where he is a citizen.Miyoko Watai, his longtime companion and the head of the Japan ChessAssociation, said Fischer was ""very happy"" to hear the news of the Icelandicparliament vote.Japanese Justice Minister Chieko Nono told reporters that if Fischer has beengranted Icelandic citizenship, it would be ""legally possible to deport him tothat country.""""We will consider (the possibility) and make an appropriate decision,"" she saidon TV Tokyo.Though a recluse over the past decade, Fischer has emerged from silence in radiobroadcasts and on his Web page to express anti-Semitic views and rail againstthe United States.Since being taken into custody, Fischer has said he wants to unilaterallyrenounce his U.S. citizenship, demanded political refugee status and announcedthat he intends to marry Watai.It wasn't immediately clear if going to Iceland would help Fischer avoidextradition to the United States if he is charged. The two countries have anextradition treaty.A federal grand jury in Washington is also investigating possiblemoney-laundering charges involving Fischer, Richard J.

Fischer has the authority to waive hisprivacy rights but has not done do.
An Icelandic supporter of Bobby Fischer said Tuesday he had paid a registrationfee that would allow the American chess legend to settle in Iceland.""It costs 20 dollars to register a new Icelandic citizen, and I've happily paidthis for him,"" Fischer supporter Einar S. Einarsson said.Iceland's parliament voted Monday to give Fischer citizenship as he fights anorder to deport him from Japan to the United States.Einarsson said Fischer's Icelandic passport was expected to be ready Wednesday.It was not clear whether the passport would be issued in Iceland or through thecountry's embassy in Japan.Einarsson said another Icelandic Fischer supporter, Saemundur Palsson, wouldarrive in Tokyo on Friday to accompany Fischer to Iceland.Fischer's Japanese lawyer, Masako Suzuki, said she expected him to be releasedwithin the week.""Unless something very unexpected happens, that would be the natural course ofevents,"" she said.The 62-year-old mercurial chess genius has been in Japanese custody since hisarrest at in July. He is wanted in the United States for violating sanctionsagainst the former Yugoslavia by playing a chess match there.The legislation to grant Fischer Icelandic citizenship was passed on Monday, andofficially became law with the approval of Iceland's Presidential Authority andwas confirmed in the Parliament Newsletter.Linda Hartley, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Iceland, said the UnitedStates was disappointed Iceland had granted Fischer citizenship.""There has been no official contact between the State Department and theIcelandic government since Friday, when the State Department sent a messagesaying it was disappointed with the foreigner's passport issued to Fischer,""Hartley said.""Bobby Fischer still remains an American citizen.

After a series of strategic moves worthy of one of hisgreatest matches, fugitive chess legend Bobby Fischer reached anagreement with Japanese authorities to avoid deportation to the UnitedStates on Wednesday. He will instead be released after nine months inprison here and flown to freedom in Iceland as early as Thursdaymorning, according to sources familiar with the case.The deal to free Fischer came after Iceland -- a chess-loving nationthat hosted his historic Cold War-era victory over Soviet chess kingBoris Spassky in 1972 -- granted Fischer citizenship this week in amove helping him evade trial in the United States. Fischer, 62, a NewYork-native, has dodged a U.S. arrest warrant since making ananti-American ``political statement'' by playing a 1992 chess match inYugoslavia in alleged violation of then-standing U.S. sanctions.Fischer evaded U.S. authorities for more than a decade with thehelp of global chess fans from Argentina to the Philippines, whooffered him shelter even as Fischer ventured out every now and theninto the public eye to offer scathing anti-American and anti-Jewishrants. He was finally nabbed at Narita International Airport outsideTokyo last July for traveling on a voided U.S. passport.But Fischer's alleged 1992 crime is not considered an extraditableoffense in Japan, and U.S. authorities were instead counting onJapanese laws mandating deportation of persons detained for travelingon false documents to their countries of citizenship. Fischer tried anumber of failed countermoves to block an unwelcome homecoming to theUnited States -- including seeking refugee status, renouncing his U.S.citizenship and unveiling plans to marry his avowed companion MiyokoWatai, a four-time Japan women's chess champion.But he found his checkmate in Iceland, where, at Fischer's request,the parliament honored his intellect and ``historic connection'' withthe tiny island nation stemming from his 1972 match there by awardinghim Icelandic citizenship with a 40-0 vote on Monday. It came despiteU.S. protests.``Mr. Fischer is a true Icelander now,'' Iceland's ambassador toJapan, Thordur Oskarsson, told reporters in Tokyo.--(optional add end)--For the wily Fischer, who long ago brought an unlikely pizzazz tothe bookish game of chess, his narrow escape marks yet another strokeof strategic genius. An eccentric personality known for his bizarrebehavior at matches and brief adherence to a religious cult, he becamea celebrated American hero after besting Spassky at the 1972championship in Reykjavik.But in the years following his early retirement from the game,Fischer grew to resent the United States, regaling it as part the``global Jewish conspiracy'' despite the fact that his mother wasJewish.Fischer has insisted from his Japanese jail cell that U.S.officials are persecuting him for his political beliefs. Hissupporters here have noted that U.S. authorities only revoked hispassport after he took to the airwaves in Manila on Sept. 11, 2001,hailing the terrorist attacks on the United States as ``wonderfulnews'' and adding that ``I want to see the U.S. wiped out.''
Bobby Fischer, the fugitive chess legend, reached anagreement Wednesday with Japanese authorities to avoid deportation tothe United States, his supporters said. Sources familiar with the casesaid he will instead be released after eight months in prison here andflown to freedom in Iceland as early as Thursday morning.The deal to free Fischer came after Iceland -- a chess-loving nationthat hosted his historic Cold War-era victory over Soviet BorisSpassky in 1972 -- granted Fischer citizenship this week in a move tohelp him evade trial in the United States. Fischer, 62, who grew up inNew York, has dodged a U.S. arrest warrant since playing a chess matchin Yugoslavia in 1992 in violation of U.S. sanctions at the time.Fischer evaded U.S. authorities for more than a decade with thehelp of global chess fans from Argentina to the Philippines, whooffered him shelter even as he ventured out every now and then intothe public eye to offer scathing anti-American and anti-Jewish rants.He was finally nabbed in July at an airport outside Tokyo fortraveling on a voided U.S. passport.Fischer's alleged violation of U.S. sanctions is not considered anextraditable offense in Japan. American authorities were insteadcounting on Japanese laws mandating deportation of persons detainedfor traveling on false documents to their countries of citizenship.Fischer made a number of failed attempts to block an unwelcomehomecoming to the United States -- including seeking refugee status,renouncing his U.S. citizenship and unveiling plans to marry hisavowed companion Miyoko Watai, a four-time women's chess champion inJapan.But Fischer found success in Iceland, where, at his request, theparliament honored his ``historic connection'' with the tiny islandnation, voting 40 to 0 Monday to grant him citizenship. The move camedespite U.S. protests. ``Mr. Fischer is a true Icelander now,''Iceland's ambassador to Japan, Thordur Oskarsson, told reporters inTokyo.Japanese officials agreed to allow Fischer to travel to his adoptedhomeland as long as he withdraws a still-pending lawsuit he filedagainst the Japanese government to block his deportation. JohnBosnitch, chairman of the Tokyo-based Committee to Free Bobby Fischer,said Fischer would do so Thursday morning before heading directly tothe airport to board a flight to Iceland via Copenhagen.``The people of Iceland have rescued Bobby Fischer frominjustice,'' Bosnitch said.The case had become an irritation for Japan, with Fischer alleging-- falsely, according to the Japanese -- that he had been physicallyabused by his captors. A Japanese official familiar with the case saidthe U.S. Embassy in Tokyo had been informed of the decision to allowFischer's release.--(optional trim starts here)--Fischer's resentment of the United States is well known. He hassaid he regards it as part of the ``global Jewish conspiracy,''despite the fact that his mother was Jewish. He has insisted from hisJapanese jail cell that U.S. officials are persecuting him for hispolitical beliefs.Fischer entered Japan on a valid 90-day visa in April 2004,according to a copy of his passport on his Web site.On Nov. 6, 2003, he had gone went to the U.S. Embassy in Bern,Switzerland, and was given additional pages to his passport. But aletter dated December 2003 from the U.S. Embassy in the Philippines,where Fischer has a daughter, advised him that his passport was beingrevoked. Fischer, according to Bosnitch, never received the letter.--(optional trim ends here)--Now U.S. officials are preparing for a legal rematch. They havesuggested that they may file new tax evasion charges against Fischer --who has publicly stated that he has not paid U.S. taxes since goinginto self-imposed exile 12 years ago, including taxes on the $3million he won during his rematch against Spassky in Yugoslavia.Such charges, U.S. officials say, may fall under extraditablecrimes in Iceland.
Iceland's Parliament voted Monday to grant Icelandic citizenship tothe American chess star Bobby Fischer, laying the groundwork, hissupporters said, for his release from the Japanese prison wherehe has been held since last summer.""We are most happy,"" said Einar Einarsson, a spokesman for acommittee that has been trying to free Fischer from Japan,where he is being detained while he fights deportation tothe United States.Einarsson, who called Fischer ""part of our modern saga and partof our recent history,"" said Fischer, the 62-year-old chess champion,might be released ""in only a few days"" and thatan Icelandic delegation planned to travel to Tokyo to escorthim back to Reykjavik.In Washington, the State Department had no comment on the case,although a spokesman noted that renunciation of American citizenship didnot allow citizens to escape prosecution of crimes in theUnited States.Monday's vote appears to be a resolution of sorts to thecurious legal limbo that Fischer fell into in 1992 when,the United States says, he violated economic sanctions against Yugoslaviaby accepting a $3.3 million fee to play an exhibitionmatch there. After that, the always reclusive, progressively more difficultFischer dropped out of sight, living in Budapest -- andpossibly the Philippines and Switzerland -- and emerging now andthen on radio stations in Iceland, Hungary and the Philippinesto rant in increasingly belligerent terms against the United Statesand against Jews.This latest episode began in July 2004, when he tried toboard a plane from Japan to Manila and was seizedby the Japanese authorities and accused of trying to leavethe country on an invalid passport. He has been heldin prison since then while the various governments, as wellas a staunch group of supporters in the chess world,have tried to find some resolution to what has beena vexing and delicate jurisdictional issue.But while the United States -- which is also investigating thepossibility of charging him with tax evasion -- regards Fischeras a fugitive from justice, in Iceland he is seenas a national hero. It was in Reykjavik in 1972that he defeated the Russian world champion, Boris Spassky, inan electrifying Cold War chess contest that pitted East againstWest. As much as the African-American track star Jesse Owens'defeat of Hitler's Aryan athletes did at the 1936 BerlinOlympics, Fischer's victory in Iceland seemed to symbolize nothing lessthan the triumph of one way of life over another-- in this case, democracy over communism.It is partly for that reason, said Bjarni Benediktsson, chairman ofthe parliamentary committee that recommended last week that Fischer begranted Icelandic citizenship, that Parliament voted in favor of hisrequest on Monday. Iceland had already agreed to issue aresident's permit and special passport to Fischer, but that hadnot proved enough for the Japanese authorities.His supporters said they had received assurances from Japan that withfull Icelandic citizenship and passport, Fischer would be free toleave the country.""It was very clear from the outset that he had agreat influence here,"" Benediktsson said of Fischer, speaking by telephonefrom Reykjavik. ""A new generation of international chess players wasborn here in Iceland after the world championship match inReykjavik, and it was very clear from the outset ofthis matter that the authorities in Iceland have very warmfeelings toward this memory.""He emphasized that the granting of citizenship was considered only asa last resort, ""after the applicant had exhausted all otherpossibilities"" of gaining freedom. He also said Fischer's ""personal opinionson social issues"" had not been a factor.An official at the Immigration Bureau of the Justice Ministry saidnothing had been decided yet about whether or how Fischermight be released. But the official said it is legallypossible that he could be sent to Iceland as adestination of repatriation under the deportation order, if he isgranted citizenship there.""This is a historic battle pitting the world's sole superpower-bully againstone lone man who had the courage to fight forhis own freedom to think and speak as he chooses,""John Bosnitch, chairman of the group, said in a statement.In a telephone interview, Einarsson played down the significance of Fischer'sreputation for misanthropy and his habit of making incendiary publicremarks. ""Everyone knows his views, and he doesn't need torepeat them again,"" he said. ""He's like Rembrandt or Mozart-- one of these very big people -- so hispersonality is beside the point.""He said Fischer was likely to make Iceland his home, atleast for the time being. ""I think he will stayin Iceland a lot, at least for the coming months,and then he will travel feely around the world --although I don't expect he will be going to America.""
","In March, 2005, when Iceland granted citizenship to Bobby Fischer, allowing him to escape extradition to the U.S. from a Japanese prison, a Japanese official said there was no reason to hold him longer. Supporters said he had lost weight and grown a long beard during his eight months in prison. U.S. officials prepared to file tax evasion charges against Fischer, who had not paid taxes on the $3 million he won playing chess in Yugoslavia in 1972. Fischer had renounced U.S. citizenship, but they noted that did not allow citizens to escape prosecution for crimes in the U.S. ",On March 22 the Japanese justice minister said it was legally possible to send Fischer to Iceland if he obtained citizenship. Fischer's lawyer expected him to be released within the week. Citizenship still required the signature of Iceland's president. The U.S. State Department expressed disappointment over Iceland's parliamentary action. As of March 23 U.S. officials were preparing tax-evasion charges against Fischer which might render him extraditable from Iceland. The same day (Wednesday) Iceland's ambassador to Japan said Iceland had forwarded documents to Japan confirming Fischer's Icelandic citizenship and hoped to give Fischer a passport before the weekend. ,"Iceland's granting of citizenship to Bobby Fischer, formally signed into law on March 22, made it legally possible for Japan to deport him to that country. Japanese law only permits deportation to a country where a person is a citizen. Fischer's Icelandic passport was expected to be ready on March 23. Japanese officials agreed to allow him to travel to Iceland after he withdraws his pending lawsuit against the Japanese government to block his deportation. A Fischer supporter said he would do so on the morning of March 24 on his way to the airport to fly to Iceland. ",Japan may allow Fischer to go to Iceland where he now holds citizenship if he withdraws a lawsuit against the government to block his deportation. His Icelandic citizenship still requires the president's signature but that appears assured. Fischer has been in Japanese prison for six months including time in solitary for a tussle with guards. Fischer renounced US citizenship but not through proper process so he remains a US citizen said the State Department. He is a fugitive from justice and there is federal warrant for his arrest. His alleged violation of US sanctions is not considered extraditable by Japan. 
D0912,D0912-A,"The angry mother of a fallen U.S. soldier has met with advisers of PresidentGeorge W. Bush after staging a protest near his ranch to demand an accounting ofhow the president has conducted the war in Iraq.Supported by more than 50 demonstrators who chanted, ""W. killed her son!"" CindySheehan told reporters: ""I want to ask the president, 'Why did you kill my son?What did my son die for?'""Sheehan, 48, didn't get to see Bush, but did talk about 45 minutes with nationalsecurity adviser Steve Hadley and deputy White House chief of staff Joe Hagin,who went out to hear her concerns.Appreciative of their attention, yet undaunted, Sheehan said she planned tocontinue her roadside vigil, except for a few breaks, until she gets to talk toBush. Her son, Casey, 24, was killed in Sadr City, Iraq, on April 4, 2004. Hewas an Army specialist, a Humvee mechanic.""They (the advisers) said we are in Iraq because they believed Saddam Husseinhad weapons of mass destruction, that the world's a better place with Saddamgone and that we're making the world a safer place with what we're doing overthere,"" Sheehan said in a telephone interview after the meeting.""They were very respectful. They were nice men. I told them Iraq was not athreat to the United States and that now people are dead for nothing. I toldthem I wouldn't leave until I talked to George Bush.""She said Hagin told her, ""I want to assure you that he (Bush) really doescare.""""And I said if he does care, why doesn't he come out and talk tome.""Sheehan arrived in Crawford aboard a bus painted red, white and blue andemblazoned with the words, ""Impeachment Tour."" Sheehan, from Vacaville,California, had been attending a Veterans for Peace convention inDallas.The bus, trailed by about 20 cars of protesters and reporters, drove at about 15(24 kph) toward Bush's ranch. After several miles (kilometers), they parked thevehicles and began to march, in stifling heat, farther down the narrow countryroad.Flanked by miles (kilometers) of pasture, Sheehan spoke with reporters whileclutching two photographs, one of her son in uniform, and the other, a babypicture, when he was seven months old.She said she decided to come to Crawford a few days ago after Bush said thatfallen U.S. troops had died for a noble cause and that the mission must becompleted.""I want to ask the president, `Why did you kill my son? What did my son diefor?"" she said, her voice cracking with emotion. ""Last week, you said my sondied for a noble cause' and I want to ask him what that noble causeis?""White House spokesman Trent Duffy said response that Bush also wants the troopsto return home safely.""Many of the hundreds of families the president has met with know their lovedone died for a noble cause and that the best way to honor their sacrifice is tocomplete the mission,"" Duffy said.""It is a message the president has heard time and again from those he has metwith and comforted.

The mother of a fallen U.S. soldier who is holding a roadside peace vigil nearPresident George W. Bush's ranch shares the same grief as relatives mourning thedeaths of Ohio Marines, yet their views about the war differ.""I'm angry. I want the troops home,"" Cindy Sheehan, 48, of California, whostaged a protest that she vowed on Sunday to continue until she can personallyask Bush: ""Why did you kill my son? What did my son die for?""Jim Boskovitch, father of slain Cpl.

Nine were killed Wednesday when anarmored vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb.Rosemary Palmer, the mother of Lance Cpl. Edward Schroeder, 23, another OhioMarine killed in Iraq, sided more with Sheehan. If the United States continuesits current course in Iraq, the death toll of U.S. troops, now at more than1,820, will only grow, she told ABC.""We either have to have more people there to do the job and better equipment, orwe have to leave _ one or the other,"" she said.Boskovitch said his son, Jeff, ""felt extremely, extremely strongly about theIraqi people and our government deciding to go over there.""""His commander in chief needed him to be there, as well as those fellowsoldiers, to help those people, help that country to be able to stand on its ownand to liberate those people,"" Boskovitch told ABC.Sheehan was among grieving military families who met with Bush in June 2004 atFort Lewis, near Seattle, Washington. That was just two months after her son,Casey, was killed in Sadr City, Iraq, on April 4, 2004.Since then, she said, various government and independent commission reports havedisputed the Bush administration's claims that Saddam Hussein had mass-killingchemical and biological weapons _ a main justification for the March 2003invasion.""I was still in shock then,"" Sheehan said in a telephone interview.""All of those reports prove my son died needlessly,"" said Sheehan. ""This provedthat every reason George Bush gave us for going to war was wrong.""Sheehan, who formed a group called Gold Star Families For Peace and has spokenout against the war across the nation, talked for about 45 minutes on Saturdaywith Steve Hadley, Bush's national security adviser, and Joe Hagin, deputy WhiteHouse chief of staff, who went out to hear her concerns.Appreciative of their attention, yet undaunted, Sheehan said she planned tocontinue her protest along the road during Bush's stay through the end of themonth.""If he doesn't come out and talk to me in Crawford, I'll follow him to D.C.,""she said.

The mother of a U.S. soldier killed in Iraq who started a quiet roadside peacevigil near President George Bush's ranch last weekend is drawing supporters fromacross the nation.Dozens of people have joined her and others have sent flowers andfood.Cindy Sheehan, 48, of Vacaville, California, says she was surprised at theresponse.""Before my son was killed, I used to think that one person could not make adifference,"" she said Wednesday under a tent where she has slept since Saturday.""But one person that is surrounded and supported by millions of people can beheard.""But Kristinn Taylor, co-leader of the Washington, D.C., chapter ofFreeRepublic.com, which has held pro-troop rallies, said Sheehan's actions aremisguided and hurt troop morale.""She has a political agenda that goes way beyond her son's death in combat,""Taylor said.Although a few residents have complained about the protesters, no one has beenarrested because the group has been on the public right-of-way, said Capt.Kenneth Vanek of the McLennan County Sheriff's Office.On Saturday, two high-level Bush administration officials, the national securityadviser and deputy White House chief of staff, talked to Sheehan for about 20minutes.Sheehan called the brief meeting ""pointless"" and still wants to talk to thepresident.Her 24-year-old son, Casey, was killed in Sadr City, Iraq, in April 2004 justfive days after he arrived. Two months later, Sheehan was among grievingmilitary family members who met with Bush at Fort Lewis, near Seattle,Washington.Since then, she said, various government and independent commission reports havedisputed the Bush administration's claims that Saddam Hussein had mass-killingchemical and biological weapons _ a main justification for the March 2003invasion.On Wednesday, a coalition of anti-war groups in Washington called on Bush tospeak with Sheehan, who they say has helped to unify the peacemovement.""Cindy Sheehan has become the Rosa Parks of the anti-war movement,"" said Rev.Lennox Yearwood, leader of the Hip Hop Caucus, an activist group. ""She's tired,fed up and she's not going to take it anymore, and so now we stand withher.""Rosa Parks is the iconic civil rights figure who refused to give up her seat ona segregated bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1955. Her arrest triggered one ofthe movement's earliest landmark events, a 381-day boycott of the bus systemorganized by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.At her makeshift camp in muddy ditches off the two-lane, winding road leading toBush's ranch, Sheehan has spent the past several days talking to reporters,hugging fellow protesters and taking brief breaks to eat sandwiches and fruitbrought by supporters. Her vigil has also become a hot topic on the Internet andblogs.Although she doesn't expect Bush to meet with her in Crawford, she says if hedid she would ask him whether he has encouraged his twin daughters toenlist.""I want him to quit using my son's death to justify more killing,"" she said.""The only way he can honor my son's death is to bring the troopshome.""Sheehan, a former Roman Catholic youth minister, formed a group called Gold StarFamilies For Peace earlier this year and has spoken out against the war acrossthe nation and overseas.
U.S. President George W. Bush was meeting with his defense and foreign policyteams Thursday at his Texas ranch, from where he'll look at world hotspots fromBaghdad to Pyongyang.Vice President Dick Cheney and top-rung advisers, including Defense SecretaryDonald H. Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, were coming for theserious talks about issues ranging from ongoing violence in Iraq and standoffswith Iran and North Korea over their nuclear programs to anti-American sentimentabroad, especially in the Middle East.Keeping with tradition, Bush is spending August at the ranch inCrawford.The unhurried pace of this one-stoplight town stands in sharp contrast to eventsacross the globe: suicide bombings in Iraq; on-again, off-again negotiationswith the reclusive North Korea; Iran's decision to restart sensitive nuclearwork; next week's pullout of some 9,000 Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip andWest Bank.Bush's update on defense and foreign policy issues comes at a time when hisapproval ratings are hovering below 50 percent. An AP-Ipsos poll conducted Aug.1-3 showed Bush's overall job approval was at 42 percent, with 55 percentdisapproving. That's about where his approval rating has been all summer, butslightly lower than it was when the year began. His approval on his handling ofIraq stood at 38 percent.Iraq, where the death toll of U.S. troops has topped 1,840, is likely to take acenter stage.The administration is hoping that progress on the political front will helpdeflate violence and allow the United States and its partners to beginwithdrawing troops next year.Rumsfeld said success in drafting a new Iraqi constitution is critical towardpersuading the majority of Iraqis that the ""new Iraq is worth fighting for."" Buta deadlock has arisen over the drafting of the charter, which is supposed to becompleted by Monday.Cindy Sheehan, a California mother of a fallen soldier, is holding a roadsideprotest to bring the troops home.So far, Rumsfeld has not publicly voiced his thoughts on when U.S. forces may beable to come home in large numbers _ a decision that hinges on the level ofviolence and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces, which now number178,000.A joint U.S.-Iraqi committee that is identifying areas to revert to Iraqicontrol will submit its final report by the end of September. That is the firststep toward what Gen. George W. Casey, the top commander in Iraq, has said couldlead to a ""fairly substantial"" reduction in the 138,000-strong U.S. force by thespring and summer of next year.Casey has not disclosed numbers, but Pentagon officials have mentioned areduction figure of 20,000 to 30,000 troops. That would still leave about100,000 Americans in Iraq well into next year.But first the Pentagon will likely have to increase the number of U.S. troopsabove the current 138,000 to improve security for a planned October referendumand a December election, when a burst of insurgent violence is expected,Rumsfeld spokesman Lawrence Di Rita said this week.In January, when Iraq held its first elections, troop levels were raised as highas 160,000, mainly by overlapping some units arriving in Iraq to begin aone-year tour with those who were ending their yearlong tours. Di Rita said thatthis time commanders could also ask for volunteers to serve extended tours orsend some U.S.-based troops to Iraq to augment the force during the fallelection period.The White House says Rumsfeld will brief the president on the QuadrennialDefense Review, a congressionally mandated top-to-bottom review of defensestrategy and plans. The review, begun earlier this year, will be completedaround January, in time for the February budget submission.
Cindy Sheehan's eyes well with tears when she talks about her oldest son, Casey,an easygoing young man with a quiet wit.Casey joined the Army in 2000, never imagining he would see combat. Five daysafter he arrived in Iraq last year, the 24-year-old was killed in SadrCity.Sheehan knows nothing can bring back her son, but she wants to talk to PresidentGeorge W. Bush. The California mother has been camping out along a road near hisranch since Saturday, vowing to remain until his Texas vacation ends later thismonth.""Before my son was killed, I used to think that one person could not make adifference,"" she said Wednesday under a tent where she has slept since arriving.""But one person that is surrounded and supported by millions of people can beheard.""Bush National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley and a deputy White House chief ofstaff talked to Sheehan on Saturday. She said the meeting, which she called""pointless,"" lasted 20 minutes. The White House said it lasted 45minutes.By Thursday, about 50 people had joined her cause, pitching tents in muddy,shallow ditches and hanging anti-war banners; two dozen others have sentflowers. Her name was among the most popular search topics Wednesday on Internetblogs.The soft-spoken Sheehan, 48, is surprised and touched at the overwhelmingresponse _ most of which is positive, she says.But not everyone supports her. Kristinn Taylor, co-leader of the Washington,D.C., chapter of FreeRepublic.com, said Sheehan's protest is misguided and ishurting troop morale.""She has a political agenda that goes way beyond her son's death in combat,""said Taylor, whose conservative group has held pro-troop rallies since the Sept.11, 2001, terror attacks and counter-protests of anti-war demonstrations.Sheehan, a Catholic youth minister for eight years, never wanted Casey to jointhe military. She said he did so after being misled by his recruiter. Althoughhe also opposed the war, he didn't try to back out.""I begged him not to go,"" she said through tears. ""I said, 'I'll take you toCanada' ... but he said, 'Mom, I have to go. It's my duty. My buddies aregoing.'""Sheehan has spent the past several days in rainy weather talking to scores ofreporters, hugging fellow protesters and taking brief breaks to eat sandwichesand fruit brought by supporters.She and her husband are separated, affected by the stress of losing their son.But her three other children, ages 19 to 24, may join her in Crawford, shesaid.Sheehan did meet with Bush in June 2004: She was among grieving militaryfamilies who met with the president at Fort Lewis, Washington. She has said herfeelings have shifted from shock to anger since then, in part because of variousreports that have disputed some of the Bush administration's justifications forthe war.Many supporters decided to go to Crawford because of rumors that Sheehan wouldbe arrested.But no protesters will be arrested unless they trespass on private property orblock the road, said Capt. Kenneth Vanek of the McLennan County Sheriff'sOffice.Trucker Craig Delaney, 53, was in Georgia on Monday when he heard numerous radioshows discussing Sheehan _ some criticizing her. He altered his route toCalifornia, heading for Texas, and got to Sheehan's site Wednesdaymorning.""I felt compelled to come and tell her I support her,"" said Delaney, aself-described hippie from Sly Park, California. ""The way they were bad-mouthinga mother whose son was killed in the war is un-American.""Nearly 40 Democratic members of Congress have asked Bush to talk to her. OnWednesday, a coalition of anti-war groups in Washington also called on Bush tospeak with Sheehan, who they say has helped to unify the peacemovement.""Cindy Sheehan has become the Rosa Parks of the anti-war movement,"" said Rev.Lennox Yearwood, leader of the Hip Hop Caucus, an activist group. ""She's tired,fed up and she's not going to take it anymore, and so now we stand withher.""Earlier this year Sheehan formed Gold Star Families for Peace and has spoken togroups across the nation and overseas.Judith Young, national president of the The American Gold Star Mothers ofAmerica Inc., said she is concerned the public will mistake her 76-year-oldWashington, D.C., nonprofit organization with Sheehan's group.In Young's group, commonly known as Gold Star Moms, mothers whose children diedin the line of duty volunteer in veterans' hospitals and programs. Members don'tdo advocacy work, Young said.___On the Net:
Two senior White House aides met here onSaturday with the angry mother of a fallen U.S. soldier, but theyrejected Cindy Sheehan's demand for a direct accounting from PresidentBush for the way he has conducted the war in Iraq.The surprise meeting, which lasted about 45 minutes, took place ona roadside several miles from the president's ranch, where federal andlocal law enforcement officials had halted Sheehan's advance towardthe 1,600-acre estate. Bush is spending much of August on vacation atthe ranch.Sheehan, a 48-year-old Vacaville, Calif., woman, was accompanied bymore than 50 placard-wielding anti-war activists. After police andSecret Service agents halted their march on a country lane, Sheehanand a half-dozen die-hard supporters stayed put while others turnedback, trudging slowly down Prairie Chapel Road under the hot CentralTexas sun.In a telephone interview after her conversation with NationalSecurity Adviser Stephen J. Hadley and White House deputy chief ofstaff Joe Hagin, Sheehan said she would remain in Crawford andcontinue to seek a meeting with Bush.``I didn't change my mind at all,'' she said.``They said the president really believed that Saddam Hussein hadweapons of mass destruction,'' Sheehan added. ``And I told them: `Imight be a grieving mom, but you men are very intelligent, and I knowyou don't believe what you're telling me.'''Hadley and Hagin said they would relay her sentiments to thepresident, according to Sheehan.Bush has met privately around the country with numerous familymembers of soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, but not withrelatives who are overtly against the war.``We mourn the loss of every life and Americans deeply appreciatethose who have made the supreme sacrifice. The way to honor thatsacrifice is to complete the mission so that their lives were not lostin vain,'' said White House deputy press secretary Trent Duffy.Sheehan's son, Casey, 24, was killed in the Sadr City section ofBaghdad on April 4, 2004. Afterward, she co-founded Gold Star Familiesfor Peace, an organization of people who have lost loved ones in Iraqor who oppose the war. Previously, Sheehan was turned away whiletrying to protest the war at the Pentagon.She told reporters here that she not only opposes the war but alsostrongly objects to Bush's assertions that fallen U.S. soldiers haddied ``for a noble cause.''``I don't want him to use my son's name, or my name, to justify anymore killings. And I want to tell the president that, and I want toask the president why my son died,'' Sheehan said, contending that thewar was ``based on horrendous lies and deceptions.''Her meeting with two of Bush's top aides came amid a spike in U.S.casualties in Iraq, accompanied by sagging public support for thepresident's conduct of the war.A Newsweek poll released on Saturday found that 61 percent ofAmericans now disapprove of Bush's handling of the war while 34percent approve. This is Bush's lowest approval rating on Iraq and thefirst time that it has dropped below 40 percent in the Newsweek Poll,the magazine said.Half of those polled said the United States is losing ground in itsefforts to establish security and democracy in Iraq while 40 percentsaid the United States is making progress there.
For more than a year, a modest bungalow known as``Peace House,'' located a few miles from President Bush's ranch, hasserved as a headquarters for antiwar activists. It is lonely work,with little more than a skeleton crew on hand much of the time.But then Cindy Sheehan hit town.The 48-year old mother of Army Spc. Casey Sheehan, who was killedin an ambush in Baghdad, Iraq, last year, is consumed by the kind ofgrief that turns into a furious determination to do something -- inher case, to confront the president and force him to explain why herson died.Now, in the space of just a few days, what started out as aseemingly quixotic personal mission has become something of aphenomenon -- with media swarming around Sheehan, leading liberal andantiwar activists parachuting in to try to make her their long-soughtvoice, and political experts in both parties working to assess whatrole she may have in galvanizing the public's gathering unhappinesswith the increasing American casualties in Iraq.Antiwar leaders hope that putting the spotlight on Sheehan willmotivate Americans who oppose the war, creating a political forcestrong enough to compel the Bush administration to change course.MoveOn.org and other liberal groups have rushed to provide support,offering media expertise and attempting to assemble a corps of otherswho have lost relatives in Iraq or have family members serving there.Liberal voices have swung into action on the Internet as well. OnWednesday, Democratic media consultant Joe Trippi organized aconference call with Sheehan for bloggers, aiming to garner morepublicity. By Wednesday afternoon, ``Cindy Sheehan'' was thetop-ranked search term on Technorati.com, the search engine for blogpostings.The White House, meantime, has sought to cope with Sheehan's vigilwithout abandoning its strategy for dealing with the families oftroops who have died. On a number of occasions, Bush has met withbereaved relatives -- including some who have challenged him sharplyon the war -- but he has done so privately, away from news cameras andreporters.Sheehan, a Vacaville resident who opposed the war even before herson's death, was a member of one such group in June 2004. She cameaway from that meeting dissatisfied and angry.``We wanted (the president) to look at pictures of Casey, we wantedhim to hear stories about Casey, and he wouldn't. He changed thesubject every time we tried,'' Sheehan said. He wouldn't say Casey'sname, called him: `your loved one.' ``Sheehan, a co-founder of the antiwar group Gold Star Families forPeace, has said that she will remain in Crawford until she gets to seeBush face to face.Until a sudden cloudburst forced her to move to Peace House earlyWednesday morning, Sheehan had been camping in a tent along a roadabout two miles from Bush's Prairie Chapel Ranch. On Saturday, the dayshe arrived in Crawford, two senior White House aides -- nationalsecurity adviser Stephen Hadley and deputy chief of staff Joe Hagin --left the ranch to meet with her on a dusty road for 45 minutes.That, she said, was not satisfactory.By Wednesday night, Sheehan had given so many interviews that shewas sucking on lozenges to soothe an inflamed throat. Her ears weresore from cradling a telephone. Her media adviser, newly arrived fromSan Francisco, said Sheehan had developed a fever.None of that stopped her. Whether talking to newspaper reporters,People magazine or radio and television interviewers -- some from asfar away as Japan -- she was relentlessly on message.''I don't believe his phony excuses for the war,`` she said of Bushin an interview with a CBS reporter for the network's northernCalifornia affiliates. ''I want him to tell me why my son died.``If he gave the real answer, people in this country would beoutraged -- if he told people it was to make his buddies rich, that itwas about oil ... ''Sheehan is certainly not the first to denounce the president overthe war. From the beginning, activists have been outspoken incriticizing Bush's policy and his stated reasons for sending U.S.troops into Iraq.For the moment however, the personal nature of Sheehan's protest --with its edge of raw emotion -- and the concentration of news mediastaked out in Crawford, where Bush is spending much of August, havecombined to raise her voice above the crowd.``Anything that focuses media and public attention on Iraq warcasualties day after day -- particularly (something) that is a goodvisual for television, like a weeping Gold Star mother -- is a reallybad thing for President Bush and his administration,'' saidindependent political analyst Charlie Cook.``Americans get a little numb by the numbers of war casualties, butwhen faces, names and families are added, it has a much greatereffect,'' he said.``Cindy Sheehan has tapped into a latent but fervent feeling amongsome in this country who would prefer that we not engage our troops inIraq,'' said Republican strategist Kellyanne Conway, president of theWashington-based firm The Polling Company.``She can tap into what has been an astonishingly silent minoritysince the end of last year's presidential contest. It will captureattention.''But other analysts predicted Sheehan would soon fade from thescene.``The president has an Iraq problem, but I don't think it's muchworsened by Mrs. Sheehan,'' said Stephen Hess of George WashingtonUniversity. ``One Gold Star mother is a sympathetic figure, butcollectively -- as Gold Star Families for Peace -- she is a movementand, as such, can be countered by a counter-movement.''I think the president might have defused the situation if he hadinvited her in instantly,`` Hess said, predicting that GOP strategistswould soon mount a counterattack.Already, there were signs of just that.Some have suggested that Sheehan is disloyal to criticize thepresident in time of war. Even in Vacaville, Sheehan said, some peoplesay she is shaming her son's memory. Conservative blogger MichelleMalkin disdainfully called the activists promoting Sheehan ''griefpimps.``The antiwar activists who have rushed to Sheehan's side are all toowell aware of the danger that her moment in the spotlight could becomejust another partisan shouting match.Said Tom Matzzie of MoveOn.org: ''Cindy reached out to us. We'ree-mailing our members about her story today, running a print ad inWaco (Texas). Cindy is a morally pure voice on the war, so we'retrying to keep the focus on her and not jump in and turn it into apolitical fight.``Since Sheehan arrived in Crawford, Peace House has been transformedinto a beehive.On the porch, bottles of water -- and a huge box of collapsiblepink umbrellas -- were waiting Wednesday to be ferried out to ''CampCasey,`` the muddy staging area along Prairie Chapel Road whereSheehan and about 100 of her supporters were gathered.On a table in the living room were stacks of white T-shirts thatread ''BUSH ... Talk to Cindy! Moms and Vets Will Stop the War!``In the tiny kitchen, two women busily chopped carrots and celery asthey prepared to feed a growing cadre of activists. Other volunteerstalked on their cellphones, coordinating with supporters around thecountry.There was much speculation about ``other moms'' and parents oftroops serving in the war coming to join Sheehan, although no oneseemed to know for certain. ``A busload is coming from Seattle,'' onewoman called out.Stephanie Frizzell, 30, said she drove from Dallas with her son,Julian, 4, ``to provide support for Cindy.'' They met last weekend ata Dallas convention of veterans for peace.According to Ann Wright, who identified herself as a former U.S.diplomat who resigned to protest the war, Sheehan seemed to make aspontaneous decision to come to Crawford when she was while addressingthe convention Friday. Wright said countless hands were raised,offering to join her mission.As Sheehan put it Wednesday: ``I just had the right idea in theright place at the right time.''Times staff writers Ronald Brownstein, Joel Havemann and JohannaNeuman in Washington contributed to this report.
Cindy Sheehan, the mother of a soldier killed in Iraq who has beencamped outside President Bush's ranch near Crawford, Texas, has takenher antiwar protest to the Internet, joining a conference call withbloggers around the country, along with a stray congresswoman.Sheehan, who has been demanding an audience with the president,told the bloggers that she has felt intimidated by the Secret Service,has been awakened in the middle of the night by thunderstorms and hasa sore throat. But, Sheehan said, she has no plans to end her vigiluntil Bush meets with her to discuss the war, he goes back to theWhite House or she is arrested.``This is going to be a very, very long haul,'' Sheehan said in acall hosted by Democratic strategist and Internet guru Joe Trippi.Trippi, who managed Howard Dean's presidential campaign, urged thebloggers to write about her protest on their individual sites. Theliberal online advocacy group MoveOn.org is also taking up Sheehan'scause, soliciting signatures for a petition in support of her causeand announcing plans to run an ad in the local paper, the WacoTribune-Herald.Many of the bloggers on the call gushed over her protest (``We loveyou, Cindy'') while Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., also chimed in toexpress her support.Sheehan, of Vacaville, Calif., earlier this week described herprotest on the popular liberal blog Daily Kos, complaining that themainstream news media have not paid enough attention to her cause,although she was interviewed Sunday on CNN's ``Late Edition.''``If we didn't have the Internet, none of us would really know whatwas truly going on,'' she said. ``This is something that can't beignored.''
As a roadside anti-war vigil initiated by aCalifornia woman who lost a son in Iraq continued near his ranchThursday, President Bush said that he sympathizes with her loss butthat agreeing to her demand to immediately withdraw troops ``would bea mistake for the security of this country.''Speaking to reporters after meeting with members of his nationalsecurity team, Bush said he has heard the voices of Cindy Sheehan andgrieving family members who say the United States should leave Iraqbecause of the mounting death toll.``I grieve for every death,'' Bush said. ``It breaks my heart tothink about a family weeping over the loss of a loved one. Iunderstand the anguish that some feel about the death that takesplace.''Nonetheless, Bush added, withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq beforethat nation's security forces are able to cope with the ongoinginsurgency ``would send a terrible signal to the enemy,'' that theUnited States is weak and easily intimidatedWhile Bush met with Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary ofDefense Donald Rumsfeld, and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice todiscuss the war and other foreign policy concerns, a growing clutch ofprotesters were encamped along the muddy shoulder of the narrow,winding road leading to Bush's 1,600-acre ranch.Sheehan, who began her vigil Saturday, has been joined by severaldozen protesters from across the country, including some others whohave had loved ones killed in Iraq.``The president says he feels compassion for me, but the best wayto show that compassion is by meeting with me and the other mothersand families who are here,'' Sheehan said. ``Our sons made theultimate sacrifice and we want answers. All we're asking is that hesacrifice an hour out of his five-week vacation to talk to us, beforethe next mother loses her son in Iraq.''Celeste Zappala of Philadelphia, said her son, Sgt. Sherwood Baker,was killed in Baghdad while looking for nonexistent weapons of massdestruction.``This war is a disaster,'' Zappala said. ``It is a betrayal of ourmilitary. It is a betrayal of our democracy.''The protesters have strung placards along the roadside sayingthings such as, ``Who would Jesus bomb?'' and ``Who lied? Who died?Who paid? Who profits?'' They also drove dozens of small, white woodencrosses into the ground along the road, in honor of those killed inIraq.Sheehan's son, Casey Sheehan, 24, a former Eagle Scout and altarboy, was killed in Baghdad on April 4, 2004, within a week of arrivingin Iraq. Sheehan met Bush two months later, as part of a group ofgrieving military family members. She has alleged that Bush treatedher callously during their private conversation, and she has demandeda second meeting to air her grievances about the war and to tell Bushabout the devastation she has felt since losing her son.In the wake of her son's death, Sheehan, 48, co-founded Gold StarFamilies for Peace, an organization of people who have lost loved onesin Iraq or who oppose the war.Although she met Saturday with two top Bush aides, Sheehan hasvowed to maintain her vigil -- both here and, if necessary, outside theWhite House -- until she is granted another meeting with the president.Sheehan's protest has created a delicate situation for the WhiteHouse, which has resisted being drawn into a public battle with awoman who lost a son in Iraq. While officials would not publiclyrefute Sheehan's description of her meeting with Bush, they did pointout that the president has met with about 900 family members of 272fallen soldiers -- sessions they describe as often emotional andmoving.
The mother of an American soldier killed inIraq led a protest march on President Bush's ranch hereon Saturday, prompting the White House to send two seniorofficials to meet her after she was blocked by theauthorities from approaching Bush's home.The mother, Cindy Sheehan, who has made regular public appearances inopposition to the war, was accompanied by several dozen chantinganti-war activists, including other parents who had lost children tothe war, as she walked down a country road towardBush's ranch. About five miles from the ranch, they weremet by the local police, who barred them from gettingany closer. Sheehan said she would remain as close aspossible until Bush agreed to see her.Later on Saturday afternoon, the two senior officials -- Stephen J.Hadley, the national security adviser, and Joe Hagin, a deputyWhite House chief of staff -- went out to meetwith Sheehan and several other protesters, said Trent D. Duffy,a spokesman for the White House.They met for about 45 minutes, and Sheehan told the twomen she appreciated their seeing her.Her son, Spc. Casey A. Sheehan of the Army, a Humveemechanic, was killed April 24, 2004, in Sadr City, Iraq.He was 24. As she walked through Crawford on Saturday,Sheehan carried pictures of him as a toddler and inhis Army fatigues.Before meeting with the officials, she told reporters, ""I want toask George Bush: Why did my son die?""She said she was particularly upset by Bush's characterization, in aspeech on Wednesday in Grapevine, Texas, of the war andthe sacrifice of the families of fallen troops.""Our men and women who have lost their lives in Iraqand Afghanistan and in this war on terror have diedin a noble cause, in a selfless cause,"" Bush saidin the speech.The confrontation came at the end of a particularly deadly weekin Iraq for American troops, and at a time whenpolls have shown that public approval of Bush's handling ofthe war has reached new lows.
","Cindy Sheehan, whose soldier son was killed in Iraq, formed the anti-war group Gold Star Families For Peace in early 2005. She was turned away while trying to protest the Iraq War at the Pentagon and although she spoke out across the nation it was her roadside vigil near President Bush's Texas ranch that gained the attention of the nation and the world. Beginning on Aug. 6, 2005 she vowed to maintain the vigil until Bush spoke with her or finished his August vacation. By August 11 neither Bush nor Sheehan had given in. ","Following her son's April 2004 death in Iraq, Cindy Sheehan has made regular public appearances across the nation protesting the war. She co-founded Gold Star Families for Peace. On August 8, 2005, Sheehan led an antiwar protest down the road leading to President Bush's ranch near Crawford, Texas. She and about 50 antiwar activists established a roadside camp not far from the ranch, vowing to remain until Bush met with her. She used the internet to garner publicity. By August 11, several dozen protesters from across the country had joined Sheehan at Camp Casey, named for her fallen son. ","When her son was killed in Iraq Cindy Sheehan launched an anti-war campaign. She made public appearances to oppose the war and founded the anti-war group, Gold Star Families for Peace. She received support from anti-war groups in Washington and spoke with Democratic Congressmen. She traveled to Texas with anti-war activists to seek a meeting with President Bush at his Ranch. She was denied a meeting and camped near the Bush ranch, saying she would remain there until Bush met with her. Leading anti-war activists joined her protest in Texas and she received liberal Internet support. ","After her son died in Iraq, Cindy Sheehan began protesting the war. She founded the Gold Star Families for Peace and began making appearances and leading protests around the country. On August 6, 2005, she led protestors to Crawford, Texas, demanding to meet with the President. Two officials met with her, but she set up a vigil and swore to continue until Bush personally met with her, even if she had to go to Washington. This protest drew world-wide media attention and garnered support from other anti-war activists. She took her protest to the internet with a conference with bloggers. "
D0912,D0912-B,"Undaunted by counter rallies and even a neighbor's gunshot blasts into the air,a woman whose son died in Iraq said she will continue her anti-war demonstrationnear President George W. Bush's ranch for three more weeks.""We can't give up, no matter hard it gets,"" Cindy Sheehan said Sunday. Shestarted the protest Aug. 6 in memory of her 24-year-old son Casey, an Armyspecialist killed in Iraq last year.Her makeshift campsite along the road leading to the Western White House hasgrown to more than 100, and hundreds more have stopped by for a few hours toshow their support. Sheehan says she won't leave ""Camp Casey"" until Bush meetswith her and other grieving families or until his monthlong ranch visitends.More than 350 war protesters rallied at the site Saturday afternoon, hours aftersome 250 Bush supporters waved American flags in a counter rally across thestreet, holding signs that said Sheehan was unpatriotic and was hurting troopmorale.While about 60 in Sheehan's group held a religious service Sunday morning, anearby landowner, Larry Mattlage, fired his shotgun twice into the air.Sheriff's deputies and Secret Service agents rushed to his house but did notarrest him.""I ain't threatening nobody, and I ain't pointing a gun at nobody,"" Mattlagesaid. ""This is Texas.""Mattlage said he was initially sympathetic toward the demonstrators, but thatthey have blocked roads in the area and caused traffic problems. He said hefired his gun in preparation for the dove-hunting season, but when asked if hehad another motive, he said, ""Figure it out for yourself.""Sheriff's deputies have kept a presence at the demonstrators' site, and morethan a dozen law enforcement cars flanked the edge of the camp Saturday to keepthem and the pro-Bush rally separated. A few from each side got into heatedverbal exchanges, but no one was arrested.Sheehan, 48, of Vacaville, California, said she was not concerned with her ownsafety but that she has told others to be aware that ""this could get physical,even though we are peaceful.""""I think we knew of the risks when we came down here,"" she said. ""I'm surprisedwe haven't had more of that since we're in Bush country.""Sheehan, who met with two top Bush administration officials on her first day ofthe protest, said some of her supporters have left the campsite but that otherskeep arriving from around the country.Bush has said he sympathizes with Sheehan but has not said if he will meet withher.Sherry Bohlen of Scottsdale, Arizona, drove with two friends to Crawford lastweek but didn't leave Sunday as planned.""This is history in the making, and it's hard to walk away from that,"" saidBohlen, whose son Thor has been in Iraq for a month.
The husband of Cindy Sheehan, the mother camped outside President George Bush'sTexas ranch to protest the death of a son in the Iraq war, has filed fordivorce, according to court documents.Patrick Sheehan filed the divorce petition Friday in Solano County court,northeast of San Francisco. His lawyer did not immediately return a call seekingcomment Monday.The couple's eldest child, Casey, 24, was an Army soldier killed in April 2004.Cindy Sheehan has said the stress of the death led to the separation of thecouple, who were high school sweethearts.Sheehan has vowed to remain in Texas through Bush's August vacation, unless hemeets with her. She began her protest 10 days ago and has since been joined bymore than 100 anti-war activists.""Our message is to bring the troops home,"" Sheehan said Monday.The White House on Monday again issued a statement saying that Bush sympathizeswith Sheehan. The president has given no indication that he will meet withher.Sheehan, 48, and other grieving military families met with Bush in June 2004 atFort Lewis, near Seattle, two months after her son's death.But she says the meeting was unsatisfactory, and it came before reports surfacedabout faulty pre-war intelligence, which enraged her.
One of President George W. Bush's neighbors will allow use of his land by dozensof war protesters who have camped in roadside ditches the past 11 days, givingthem more room and halving their distance from Bush's ranch.Fred Mattlage, an Army veteran, said he sympathizes with the demonstrators whosemakeshift camp off the winding, two-lane road leading to Bush's ranch hasangered most residents. Mattlage said the group will be safer on his corner1-acre lot (0.4-hectare).""I just think people should have a right to protest without being harassed,""Mattlage told The Associated Press Tuesday night. ""And I'm against the war. Idon't think it's a war we need to be in.""Cindy Sheehan of Vacaville, California, started the vigil Aug. 6 to honor herson Casey, who was killed in Iraq last year. Sheehan has vowed to remain throughBush's monthlong ranch visit unless he meets with her and other grievingfamilies.Mattlage's Monday night offer, accepted by protesters Tuesday, will put themabout a mile from Bush's ranch, said Hadi Jawad of the Crawford Peace House,which is helping the group.Demonstrators said they would start moving their tents, anti-war banners andportable toilets to the new site Wednesday and hope to have the new camp set upin time for a dusk candlelight vigil.The vigil will be one of about 1,000 to be held across the country, an effortorganized by liberal advocacy groups MoveOn.org Political Action, TrueMajorityand Democracy for America.Larry Mattlage, a distant cousin of Mattlage's who owns nearby land, fired ashotgun twice into the air Sunday but no one was injured. But Fred Mattlage doesnot share his cousin's frustrations with the group.For more than a week, the rural area has been a traffic nightmare as the campattracted hundreds more protesters as well as Bush supporters holdingcounter-rallies.A resident was arrested Monday night after authorities say he ran over hundredsof small wooden crosses bearing names of fallen U.S. soldiers.Tuesday morning, several landowners asked county commissioners to extend for atleast two miles (3.2 kilometers) the public ""no parking"" zone around Bush'sranch. The ordinance now prohibits cars from stopping on the road within about aquarter of a mile.Bush, who said he sympathizes with Sheehan, has made no indication that he willmeet with her. Sheehan and other families met with Bush two months after herson's death before she became a vocal opponent of the war.
Barbara Cummings was home in San Diego lastMonday, listening to an Air America radio broadcast, when she heardthe tale of a woman who was coming here to join Cindy Sheehan in hergrowing protest against the war in Iraq.The woman on the radio had a son who had signed on for a secondtour of duty in the Army after losing his job. In two weeks, he isscheduled to ship out to Iraq. Cummings jumped on the phone and calledher friend, Gloria Polk. ``I asked her, `Are you following the CindySheehan story?' And she was.''The next day, the two retirees hopped in a rented minivan for the22-hour drive to the heart of Texas.Saturday, Cummings found herself in front of the Crawford PeaceHouse, a gathering place for protesters, holding a hand-lettered sign.She was directing a stream of cars descending on this normally sleepytown to a dirt parking lot adjacent to a nearby high school footballfield.Polk, meanwhile, was at the wheel of her blue Dodge Caravan,shuttling protesters up to the roadside campsite near President Bush's1,600-acre ranch where Sheehan has been holding her defiant vigil formore than a week.``We're both here because of our grandchildren,'' Cummingsexplained. ``It feels like a word-of-mouth thing. Everybody I meet issaying they had to be here.''While the antiwar activists buzzed around the Peace House preparingfor a scheduled rally, more than 150 flag-waving marchers made theirway toward Sheehan's camp to show their support for the war. Also, alone demonstrator drove a pickup truck blaring country music with alarge American flag flying from its bed. A sign on his door read:``Texas Is Bush Country.''James Vergauwen and his wife, Wynell, preferred to stay put next totheir Harley to make their point. ``I'm just here to let the presidentand the troops know that there are people here who do support them,''said James Vergauwen, who wore a cap emblazoned ``The price of freedomis not free.''``I don't agree with the president about everything. I just wishCindy Sheehan could spend one hour in the president's shoes makingtough decisions.''Several hundred antiwar protesters converged on Crawford thisweekend, and many of them had similar stories. They believe thatSheehan, a 48-year-old mother from Vacaville, Calif., whose son waskilled in Iraq last year, has magically ignited a struggling peacemovement with her quiet, but defiant protest.``It's just a miracle what's going on here,'' said Bill Mitchell,who lost his son, Michael, in Iraq on April 4, 2004 -- the same daythat Sheehan's son, Casey, was killed. Along with Sheehan, he hasprotested the war for more than a year and helped organize othermilitary families in support of their cause. But often it seemed thatno one cared. ``We've worked so long and hard to get our messageout,'' he said.Ray McGovern, a former intelligence official turned antiwaractivist, came down from Virginia to support Sheehan. ``I think Cindyhas lit a spark where Americans can identify with the human costs ofthe war,'' he said.While Sheehan's protest has received the aid of public relationspros, political operatives and even a television spot since it starteda week ago Saturday, many of the people drawn here said it was becauseof her simple but compelling story. Sheehan is the grieving mother ofa fallen soldier and she wants the president to explain to her why.``I'm here just to support this lady and show there is support forgetting out of Iraq and stopping this maniac from doing what he isdoing,'' said Lawrence Reuben, a Vietnam veteran and a helicoptertechnician, from nearby Benton, Texas. ``Why can't the president juststop and talk to the woman and say, `Lady, I know where you're comingfrom. This war is not going the way I intended.' ''At the Peace House, a small wood-frame cottage just across therailroad tracks from this town's only traffic signal, things werehumming. Outside, the parents of fallen soldiers were doing interviewswith reporters while volunteers prepared signs, sold T-shirts andbuttons and offered food and water to protesters.Before Sheehan's arrival, the house, established in 2003 by Dallaspeace activists, had $121 in the bank and its phone cut off because ofoverdue bills. But once word of Sheehan's protest took flight, moneybegan to flow in. A woman from Italy paid for a large party tent,coolers and a generator. Other strangers sent checks and made depositsdirectly into the group's PayPal account. In one week, the house hasamassed enough money to pay off its $40,000 mortgage.``I've been walking around with my mouth open and in a daze for thepast two or three days,'' said Kay Lucas, the Peace House director.``It's a blessing, a miracle. It's like the parable of the loaves andthe fishes. The money and the phone calls and the letters of supporthave all been phenomenal.''Lucas said that the staff of the Peace House sent an e-mail toSheehan once they learned that she planned to come to Crawford. Sinceher arrival, the house has been a sanctuary, a place for Sheehan andother protesters to take a nap, a shower or a break from the roadsidecamp.At Camp Casey, the name given to Sheehan's encampment, a caravan ofcars drove by her as she stood wearing a straw hat in the blazing sun,fighting back tears as she acknowledged her supporters. She wore aT-shirt bearing her dead son's picture. On her left ankle was a smalltattoo that read: Casey '79-04.Before long, she climbed onto the back of a pickup truck to addressher supporters, who applauded loudly. She smiled humbly but her wordswere uncompromising.``Who knew that the beginning of the end of the occupation of Iraqwas going to start in Crawford, Texas, last Saturday?'' she said.``Who knew that America would finally stand up and say we're sick andtired of this (expletive)? Bring our troops home.''
Two women, both of whom have lost children, are out to changegovernment policy. Can they succeed? Should they succeed?The two women are Beth Holloway Twitty and Cindy Sheehan. Twitty'sdaughter, Natalee Holloway, went missing in Aruba in May. Sheehan losther son, Casey, in Iraq last year.Both women have proved savvy in using the media. And, although wemust sympathize with both, we must also consider the impact of theirefforts on the institutions that have been created to deal withproblems of law and war.Twitty believes that Aruban authorities are not workingenergetically and competently to find out what happened to herdaughter. In taking her case to the public, she has enlisted much ofthe media, particularly cable news. Yet, while many have criticizedTV's infatuation with the Case of Yet Another Pretty White Girl, adeeper point needs to be remembered: the importance of victims'rights.For decades, even as the crime rate soared, the legal and popularculture chose to dwell on the sympathetic side of criminals -- thatthey, too, were victims of a racist and unjust society. Finally,law-abiding Middle America said, ``Enough!'' In the last two decades,tragic events have propelled such new figures as John ``America's MostWanted'' Walsh into rightful prominence. Politicians have responded tothis cultural shift by toughening laws, hiring more cops andincreasing prison sentences.Yet there's obviously still more work to be done. The recent caseof Joseph Edward Duncan -- charged with triple homicide and abductionof an 8-year-old girl -- demonstrates that the revolving door stillspins out of control. Duncan was legally deemed a sexual psychopath in1980. Yet, for much of the last quarter-century, he has been out ofjail, free to do who knows what. It's apparent that even today manyofficials still calculate that it's not really worth worrying aboutcatching criminals and keeping them caught.By this reckoning, the Natalie Holloway case should not be seen asthe opportunity to exploit the memory of a telegenic blonde, butrather to change the lenient professional calculus of cops, judges andparole boards.Cindy Sheehan, too, wishes to use the media for her cause, gettingthe United States out of Iraq. After stumping the country for monthsin obscurity, she hit upon a media-friendly stratagem. She campedoutside George W. Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, where boredreporters were eager for a lively story.It's Sheehan's right to protest, and most likely her efforts willincrease opposition to the war; every movement, to be effective in themedia age, needs a face. And now the anti-war movement has its face.But it's worth pausing over the one specific request Sheehan hasmade: that the president meet with her to talk about Iraq.Were Bush to do so, it would set a bad precedent. Without regard tothe merits of this particular war, a president should not bemedia-blackmailed into such a meeting. During World War II, some400,000 Americans were killed, and so should President Franklin D.Roosevelt have met with each one of those families?In wartime, we need a commander in chief, not a consoler in chiefor a debater in chief.It's possible that Bush policies will be overturned at the ballotbox in the coming elections. If so, that would be an example of thesystem responding legitimately to public pressure.What connects Twitty and Sheehan is that they want to make change.What will validate their efforts permanently is if they make changethat strengthens useful institutions as opposed to weakening them.That means forcing the criminal justice system to do its job, on theone hand, while leaving Bush and the electorate to do their jobs onthe other.
Cindy Sheehan rode into town 10 days ago, aforlorn mother with a penetrating question for her president: Why didmy son die in Iraq?But now the same wave of publicity and political anger that sherode to become a nationally known symbol of the antiwar movementthreatens to crash down on Sheehan herself.Conservative commentators and Web sites are taking aim at Sheehanwith the same ferocity she has aimed at President Bush. In part, theyare using her own words as ammunition against her -- reciting suchcontroversial comments as her vow to refuse pay taxes to a governmentwaging an ``illegal'' war and her desire to see Bush impeached.The backlash is becoming a new object lesson in how saturationmedia coverage and the instinct for personal attack are shapingpolitical debate. Some independent commentators said the pushback onthe right had succeeded in part at scuffing the public sympathy anddeference she had earned as the mother of a fallen soldier, and shownhow virtually any subject relating to the Iraq war and Bush'spresidency is viewed through a partisan lens.``Cindy Sheehan has emboldened the progressives who oppose the warand caused the conservative die-hards who are behind the war to gointo a defensive mode,'' said Michael Harrison, publisher of Talkersmagazine, a trade publication for talk radio. ``Cindy Sheehan is goingto be a target, and they'll probably go through her past to find whatthey can to discredit her.''Since her son, Casey, 24, was killed in Iraq last year, Sheehan hastraveled the country trying to drum up opposition to the war in Iraq.She has participated in peace conferences, demonstrations and a mockcongressional hearing about the infamous Downing Street memo, notes ofa meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his top advisersthat said the Bush administration had decided to go to war and moldedintelligence findings to support that decision.In that time, Sheehan, 48, a soft-spoken woman who says she wasradicalized by her son's death, has engaged in her fair share ofinflammatory rhetoric.``It's obvious Cindy Sheehan has become a political player, whoseprimary concern is embarrassing the president,'' Fox Televisionpersonality Bill O'Reilly wrote Tuesday in an online column. ``She isno longer just a protester.''Bush, Sheehan said, lied to the American people about the war andshould be impeached. And she is refusing to pay taxes in hopes thatthe Internal Revenue Service will come after her to collect. ``I'm notsupporting a government that wages an illegal, immoral war,'' shesaid. ``I want them to come after me, so I can put the war on trial.''Still, she called some of the statements attributed to herdistortions. Contrary to a letter attributed to her that iscirculating widely on the Internet, she claims she never said that theUnited States is waging the war in Iraq to protect Israel.``I have said a lot of strong things, and I'll stand by everythingI said,'' Sheehan said, adding that she thought the document had beenaltered. ``But I didn't say that.''The scrutiny that has accompanied Sheehan's quick rise toprominence has extended to her family. Several of her in-laws havepublicly criticized her protest -- announcing their displeasure in arelease to the Drudge Report. And news that Sheehan's husband,Patrick, has filed for divorce has been trumpeted by some bloggers asevidence of her extreme views.Sheehan acknowledges that that some of her views are becoming adistraction. Also, she said, some of the groups that have aided herprotest have agendas -- including conspiracy theories about the Sept.11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and some vaguely anti-Semitic theoriesabout the cause of the war -- that she says she does not share.Consequently, she has asked that her camp site near Bush's ranch berestricted only to organizations of military families, or those thathave lost loved ones in the war.``Attention got focused on the messenger and not the message,''Sheehan said. ``My thing is ending the war in Iraq. But there are alot of people who want to attach their horse to my wagon because ofthe exposure I'm getting.''The increased scrutiny of Sheehan is coming as some residents hereare growing irritated with the stream of antiwar protesters drawn toher vigil.A spokeswoman for Sheehan Tuesday announced plans to move the campfrom the drainage ditches next to the winding road about two milesfrom Bush's 1,600-acre spread to a field on a ranch offered by one ofBush's neighbors. The new camp would be about a mile from Bush'sranch. All that would be left behind at the original site would bethree tents and hundreds of white, wooden crosses bearing the names oftroops killed in Iraq.The move followed complaints by about 60 of Bush's neighbors, whopetitioned the county to expand a no-parking zone around the camp, inan effort to avert the traffic tie-ups that have become commonplace asthe protest has grown. Also, Monday night a truck dragging chains anda pipe demolished some of the crosses.Sheehan has promised to remain encamped throughout Bush's five-weekstay here and to return whenever the president does. She alsoannounced plans for a series of nearly 1,000 candlelight vigilsnationwide on Wednesday night. Liberal advocacy groups MoveOn.orgPolitical Action and Democracy for America are organizing theprotests.``All of this other b.s. just clouds my message,'' Sheehan said.``My message is that of a brokenhearted mom sitting down in front ofGeorge Bush's ranch wanting to know why my son died.''
CRAWFORD, Texas - President Bush, noting that lots of people wantto talk to the president and ""it's also important forme to go on with my life,"" on Saturday defendedhis decision not to meet with the grieving mom ofa soldier killed in Iraq.Bush said he is aware of the anti-war sentiments of CindySheehan and others who have joined her protest near theBush ranch.""But whether it be here or in Washington or anywhere else,there's somebody who has got something to say to thepresident, that's part of the job,"" Bush said on theranch. ""And I think it's important for me to bethoughtful and sensitive to those who have got something tosay.""""But,"" he added, ""I think it's also important for me togo on with my life, to keep a balanced life.""The comments came prior to a bike ride on the ranchwith journalists and aides. It also came as the crowdof protesters grew in support of Sheehan, the California motherwho came here Aug. 6 demanding to talk to Bushabout the death of her son Casey. Sheehan arrived earlierin the week with about a half dozen supporters. Asof yesterday (Saturday) there were about 300 anti-war protestors andapproximately 100 people supporting the Bush Administration.Sheehan is seeking a justification for the war, as well asher son's death.""I don't want comfort from him,"" she said Friday. """"I wantanswers. I want the truth.""Bush on Saturday said, ""I've heard their complaints about my policy.I think it would be a big mistake to withdrawimmediately from Iraq, which is what they're suggesting we do.""In addition to the two-hour bike ride, Bush's Saturday schedule includedan evening Little League Baseball playoff game, a lunch meetingwith Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, a nap, some fishingand some reading.""I think the people want the president to be in aposition to make good, crisp decisions and to stay healthy,""he said when asked about bike riding while a grievingmom wanted to speak with him. ""And part of mybeing is to be outside exercising.""""So I'm mindful of what goes on around me,"" Bush added.""On the other hand, I'm also mindful that I've gota life to live and will do so.""On Friday, Bush's motorcade drove by the protest site en routeto a Republican fund-raising event at a nearby ranch. AsBush rolled by, Sheehan held a sign that said, ""Whydo you make time for donors and not for me?""Later Friday, more than 100 supporters of Bush led by MikeGallagher, a radio talk show host, showed up at theprotest site to show their support for his Iraq policy.On Saturday, authorities kept the two groups separated.Bush on Saturday also defended his Iraq policy in his weeklyradio address, saying the war is going well.""Iraqis are taking control of their country, building a free nationthat can govern itself, sustain itself and defense itself,"" hesaid. ""And we're helping Iraqis succeed.""
Cindy Sheehan, the grieving and hustling mother who has stalked PresidentBush to his sagebrush getaway, has acquired public relations advisers,no less. The acquisition seems superfluous.Sheehan herself could hire out as a PR consultant. Experience paysoff.Sheehan had been working her way across the country with littleto show, beyond the old anti-war fan base, for hereffort to stir up righteous opposition to the president's war.Then she hit on the idea of staking out the roadto Bush's ranch. Brilliant.Reporters who are doomed to follow presidents to their vacation hidey-holesare a forlorn lot, and the more so when thespot, like Crawford, Texas, is miles from any restaurant worthyof the adjective ""expense account."" The news is usually sparseto nonexistent and the journalists find themselves turning out forbriefings at which some third assistant press secretary cheerily announcesthat the president is enjoying himself and, far from neglectingbusiness, has congratulated the just-crowned Kansas Corn Queen.So into this bog of sloth and ennui drops Cindy Sheehan.You can count on it that even the most stridentlysecular journalists were thanking God.Even so, the manna was taken up only slowly. For thefirst few days, displaying all the vigor that has markedthem during the Bush presidency, the media took only gingerlynotice. But ultimately the Great American News Machine is rightup there with nature in abhorring a vacuum.Feature stories about Sheehan, her son and his service, and aboutthe branch of the family that doesn't cotton to herprotest, began appearing. They drew a slow accretion of thelike-minded to Sheehan's standard.Sheehan's own small Gold Star Families for Peace was joined bythe women's anti-war outfit, CodePink, and by TrueMajority, the politicalarm of Ben and Jerry's ice cream. And Sheehan goton the horn to the bloggers.With activist free-booters trickling in, before you knew it the mediahad a genuine pseudo-event on their hands and since havebeen going totown on the story.As you'd expect, this has the political right indignant, as itis these days at just about everything. Conservatives claim thewhole business has been blown out of proportion by theever-plotting liberal media, who are of course out to getBush.Public opinion has turned against the war, but the change hascarried no great anti-war excitement. The public has maintained considerablepoise, given the provocation of a war disingenuously huckstered, ineptly plannedand increasingly pricey in life, limb and treasure.Bush's wan gesture of sympathy to Sheehan flopped. He has sincehunkered down, and now the motorcades in and out ofthe ranch have takento whizzing past the rankling encampment. A blur is apparently thenext best thing to out of sight, out of mind.Is Bush discomfited? His supporters complain that he is, but sowhat? Discomfiture is small enough rebuke, when you consider whathe hasgotten us into.Cindy Sheehan isn't going to bring anti-war mobs boiling into thestreets, but if she gives our oft-proclaimed ""war president"" asleeplessnight or two, it's hard to see how that would bea bad thing.Tom Teepen is a columnist for Cox Newspapers.

Cindy Sheehan, the mother of a soldier killedin Iraq who has set up a vigil near PresidentBush's ranch, said Tuesday that she was ""very disturbed"" thata local resident had mowed down hundreds of small crossesbearing the names of other dead American soldiers.Further, Sheehan promised that her 10-day-old protest was ""only the beginning""of what she called a growing national movement to bringall American men and women home from the war.Camp Casey, Sheehan's increasingly crowded roadside encampment named after her son,will soon move to a large property even closer tothe president's ranch, she said.""A kind gentleman from down the road offered us the useof his property,"" Sheehan told reporters Tuesday night. She identifiedthe man as Fred Mattlage, whom she described as adistant cousin of Larry Mattlage, a local resident who fireda shotgun across the road from the encampment on Sundayafternoon.Sheehan said the property, near a Secret Service checkpoint about amile from Bush's ranch, would have plenty of space forthe parked cars that have jammed the roadside, irritating localresidents. Fred Mattlage could not be reached on Tuesday toconfirm Sheehan's account.In the meantime, a group of Bush's neighbors appeared before theMcLennan County Commission on Tuesday morning asking that a no-parkingzone near the president's ranch be expanded, effectively forcing CampCasey to move to the town of Crawford, seven milesaway.Neighbors have complained of traffic jams and blocked roads, and somesaid they worried about the safety of their children, whostarted school on Tuesday.On Monday night, the police arrested a local resident who hadused a truck to mow down about half of the500 small wooden crosses hammered into the roadside dirt. Sheehan'ssupporters put the crosses back in place on Tuesday morning.""What happened last night is very disturbing to all of us,and it should be really disturbing to America,"" Sheehan saidin a news conference at Camp Casey on Tuesday morning.""Because no matter what you think about the war, weshould all honor the sacrifice of the ones who havefallen. And to me it's so ironic that I'm accusedof dishonoring my son's memory by doing what I'm doing,by the other side, and then somebody comes and doesthis.""Sheehan, who has vowed not to leave until Bush comes offhis ranch and speaks to her, said that if localresidents wanted her to leave, ""they should talk to theirneighbor, George Bush, and tell him to talk to us.""(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)Bush did meet with Sheehan in June 2004, but she hassaid that the president was disrespectful to her by referringto her as ""Mom"" throughout the meeting.Bush has since said he is sympathetic to Sheehan, 48, ofVacaville, Calif., whose son, an Army specialist, was killed at24 in Baghdad on April 4, 2004. On Tuesday aWhite House spokeswoman, Dana Perino, said that while the presidentdisagreed with Sheehan's views, ""he says he respects her rightto peacefully protest.""Sheehan's supporters said they had planned nearly 1,000 anti-war vigils acrossthe country on Wednesday night.

","By Aug. 13 Sheehan's group of about a half-dozen activists had grown to about 300 including reporters and confronted by about 100 Bush supporters. The drainage-ditch roadside encampment, dubbed Camp Casey after Sheehan's son, was crowded and caused traffic congestion. On August 16 Sheehan announced that a neighbor had offered a spacious field about one mile from Bush's ranch to accommodate Camp Casey. Sheehan promised to remain encamped there throughout Bush's 5-weeek stay and to return whenever he does. She also announced a series of 1,000 candlelight vigils nationwide on Aug. 17. ","Over 100 protesters have joined Sheehan's roadside camp. On August 13, over 350 rallied at the site, undaunted by an earlier counter rally across the road. Sheehan vows to remain through Bush's August vacation, unless he meets with her. To get her message out, Sheehan has received aid from public relations and political operatives and a television spot. As local residents have grown irritated by the stream of protesters, Sheehan announced plans to move the camp to a field offered by one of Bush's neighbors. They plan to complete the move before a dusk candlelight vigil on August 17. ","Six days after Cindy Sheehan arrived in Texas more than 350 protestors, including members of Code Pink and True Majority, and over 100 people supporting President Bush had converged on Camp Casey, Sheehan's Texas encampment. Sheehan continued her protests and received support from liberal groups. She announced plans for 1000 candlelight protest vigils nationwide. Sheehan stated she would continue her anti-war activities for the duration of Bush's vacation unless he met with her. Sheehan was savvy in using the media for her cause. She sought to embarrass the President as a strategy to advance her political objective. ","Cindy Sheehan is receiving more support as her vigil continues. The number of protestors rose to 350 and the pro-Bush contingent reached 250, creating parking problems and traffic jams. The road encampment included 100's of white crosses representing those killed in Iraq. Someone knocked over many of these crosses, drawing outrage. On August 17, the protestors began moving to land provided by one of Bush's neighbors, where they will have more parking available. Nearly 1,000 candlelight vigils were planned to occur nationwide that evening. Sheehan also is getting public relations advice and is refusing to pay her taxes. "
D0913,D0913-A,"The US Supreme Court on Wednesday was to review the displaying in public spaces of the Ten Commandments, the fundamental moral precepts of Judeo-Christian religions, in a case that could define the extent of separation of church and state in American society.Following challenges to the use of public property for displaying the commandments in Texas and Kentucky, the court will decide under what conditions, if at all, such explicitly religious displays are permitted.The first amendment to the US Constitution establishes the principle of separation of church and state, but the details of this principle remain unclear in the face of numerous contradictory decisions by courts over many decades.Jews and Christians believe the Ten Commandments are the basic moral guidelines given to Moses directly by God on Mount Sinai.The court will review, in the Kentucky case, the legality of displaying framed copies of the Ten Commandments in two courthouses among copies of other documents that form the basis of US laws.The Texas case involves the legality of a stone monument inscribed with the commandments installed on the grounds of the state legislature.Last October, the Supreme Court declined to review a third case, concerning the installation of a stone replica of the commandments in front of the state Supreme Court of Alabama.The case has drawn extremely high interest from both religious groups and secular society advocates across the United States.
The US Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday on the constitutionality of displaying in public spaces the Ten Commandments, in a case on the officially mandated separation of church and state in US society.While about 100 people from opposing groups protested outside the court, lawyers and court justices debated two challenges to the use of public property for displaying the commandments, fundamental moral precepts Jews and Christians believe God gave to Moses on Mount Sinai.In the coming weeks, the court is expected to decide under what conditions, if at all, such displays are permitted under the US Constitution.The Constitution's first amendment establishes the principle of separation of church and state, but how this should be interpreted remains unclear in the face of numerous contradictory decisions by courts over recent decades.Wednesday, the Supreme Court reviewed two cases, one a challenge to the display of framed copies of the Ten Commandments in two Kentucky courthouses, among other documents that form the basis of US laws.The second addressed the legality of a stone monument inscribed with the commandments, nationalist and and other religious symbols installed on the grounds of the Texas state legislature.The hearings were marked by intense discussion of the meaning of the Ten Commandments in US traditions, examining whether they are essentially religious edicts or cultural norms.Defenders cited the example of the commandment ""Thou shalt not kill"" as demonstrating that they do not contradict or surmount secular laws.However, justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg challenged that view by noting that other commandments are specifically religious, one requiring observation of the sabbath.""Have you read the first four commandments?"" she demanded of one of her colleagues.Appearing to endorse the displays -- while noting most Americans could not recite the commandments -- conservative justice Antonin Scalia called them ""the symbol that government derives its authority from God.""""I see nothing wrong with the government reflecting that. We're a tolerant society,"" Scalia said.Liberal justice Stephen Breyer countered that, although the US is a highly religious country, ""we are also committed to secularism.""The case has drawn extremely high interest from both religious groups and secular society advocates across the United States.""Government supports Christianity, but we want it to be neutral,"" said Eric Heirman, who joined a group of atheists outside the court protesting against religious displays.A young teenager, one of a group of people praying outside the court in support of the displays, argued to the contrary.""I think religion has to be shown everywhere. I think people should start to believe,"" he said.While there were no clear indications of how the justices might rule, arguments frequently returned to the issue of the context of the display, with justices making reference to the  73-year-old marble frieze in their own courtroom, which depicts Moses holding the commandments among numerous other historical figures of law.The emphasis on context could possibly lead to the court avoiding making a categorical decision and instead ruling in favor of one of the displays and against the other.
The Supreme Court struggled Wednesday with thepolitically charged issue of whether prominent display of the TenCommandments at government buildings violates separation of church andstate.In a Texas case, the court heard a challenge to a granite monumentdepicting the biblical Ten Commandments that sits near the entrance tothe state Capitol in Austin. A second case tests whether Kentuckyjudges went too far when they posted framed copies of the TenCommandments on the walls of their county courthouse.Defenders of the displays say they merely acknowledge the nation'sreligious heritage and the historical role of the Ten Commandments asa source of law and morality. The challengers say the biblicalcommands show the government to be endorsing religion, a violation ofthe First Amendment's ban on an ``establishment of religion.''The questions asked by the justices suggested they are headed for asplit decision.``It's so hard to draw the line,'' said Justice Sandra DayO'Connor, the frequent centrist who is likely to draw the line in bothcases.State lawmakers may open their sessions with a prayer delivered bya chaplain, O'Connor noted, citing a past ruling that upheld thispractice. How then can it be unconstitutional to have a monument withTen Commandments sitting outside the Capitol, she asked.Because placing the Ten Commandments in front of the Capitol``conveys a powerful message'' that the government itself ``isendorsing religion,'' said Duke law professor Erwin Chemerinsky onbehalf of Thomas Van Orden, a homeless Texas man who sued to have themonument removed. ``This is a sacred and solemn text. These are God'swords to God's followers.''To which Justice Antonin Scalia replied, in effect, what's wrongwith that?``It's a symbol that the government derives its authority fromGod,'' he said. ``That's what this is about. Our laws are derived fromGod.''Scalia said he believed 90 percent of the American people supportedhaving the Ten Commandments on display, even if ``85 percent of themcouldn't tell you what they say.''Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said he too saw no problem with thedisplay of the Ten Commandments. He said he did not understand ``thisobsessive concern with anything religious.'' Those who do not wish tosee the Ten Commandments at the Capitol grounds ``can avert theireyes.'' Demands to remove the Ten Commandments show ``hostility toreligion,'' he added.The justices heard two hours of argument, and they sounded closelysplit. Four justices -- John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth BaderGinsburg and Stephen G. Breyer -- support a distinct separation ofchurch and state, and signaled they are likely to vote to strike downthe religious displays in Texas and Kentucky.When Mathew Staver, a lawyer representing the Kentucky judges,described the Ten Commandments as secular, not just religious,Ginsburg stopped him.``Have you read the first four Commandments?'' she asked.They begin with the words, ``I Am the Lord Thy God. Thou shalt haveno other gods before me.'' Followers are also told not to have ``anygraven images,'' to ``take the Name of the Lord Thy God in vain,'' andare reminded to keep the Sabbath Day holy.Four others -- Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and JusticesClarence Thomas, Scalia and Kennedy -- have upheld religious displaysand invocations at public buildings.None of the lawyers took an all-or-nothing stand on the issue.Chemerinsky, for example, said he saw no problem with a display inthe courtroom where the justices met Wednesday -- high on the wallcarved in marble is a depiction of Moses holding the stone tablets.The marble frieze depicts ``lawgivers'' throughout history, fromHammurabi and Solomon to Napoleon and John Marshall, the fourth chiefjustice of the Supreme Court.Lawyers on the opposite side of the case from Chemerinsky agreedthat religious presentations by government could go too far. ActingSolicitor General Paul Clement, arguing on behalf of the Bushadministration, was asked about Alabama Justice Roy Moore, whosedisplay of the Ten Commandments in the center of the state's SupremeCourt building has been rejected by lower courts. That ``crosses aconstitutional line,'' Clement replied.Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott was asked whether the statecould display a crucifix.``I seriously question whether a crucifix would be acceptable,'' hesaid.By contrast, the Ten Commandments are not just a religious symbol,he said. They ``are a historically recognized symbol of law,'' Abbottsaid.(Optional add end)O'Connor could decide to split the difference on the issue byupholding the Ten Commandments in one case and striking them down inthe other. For example, she could vote to uphold the Texas monumentbecause it sits among other statutes and monuments on the Capitolgrounds -- at one point, she described it ``as a park-like setting.''However, she could also agree with her more liberal colleagues thatthe Kentucky judges went too far because they were determined to postthe Ten Commandments so visitors would be all but obliged to readthem. She sharply questioned the lawyer in the Kentucky case becauseofficials there said they were trying to ``demonstrate America'sChristian heritage'' when they first posted the Ten Commandments fiveyears ago.The Supreme Court, including the ailing Rehnquist, will vote on thetwo cases behind closed doors later this week. The justices will issuea written opinion by late June.

A granite monument of the Ten Commandments outside theTexas Capitol amounts to an unconstitutional government endorsement of religion,a lawyer favoring a high wall between church and statetold the Supreme Court on Wednesday.Arguments in the Texas case and a similar one from Kentuckypose the question of whether and how the Ten Commandmentscan be displayed on government property. Rulings in the casescould decide the shape of church-state relations for decades tocome.The high court's decisions -- probably issued by the end ofJune -- could significantly raise or lower the wall separatinggovernment and religion. In doing so, they could clarify decadesof confusing, muddled jurisprudence on what constitutes government endorsement ofreligion.In the Texas case, a homeless man filed suit challenging theconstitutionality of a 6-foot by 3-foot monument in the shapeof two tablets, inscribed with the Ten Commandments, two Starsof David and other symbols.The 43-year-old granite monument -- one of 38 on the TexasCapitol grounds in Austin -- was donated by the FraternalOrder of Eagles. The tablets are located roughly 75 feetfrom the Capitol building and 123 feet from the stateSupreme Court.Opponents say that because the monument is on the Capitol groundsunder the authority of the Texas legislature, it constitutes governmentendorsement of Christianity -- and in particular Protestant faiths, fromwhich the display's Ten Commandments text is derived.""Here you have a monument that claims not only is therea God, but God has dictated 10 rules for behavior,""said Erwin Chemerinsky, a lawyer for the Texas man whowants the tablet removed. ""Imagine the Buddhist or Muslim whowalks into the Supreme Court. He will realize this isnot his government.""But lawyers supporting the monument and other similar displays argued thatthe Ten Commandments are a historically recognized symbol of law.And they noted that in a 1983 case, the SupremeCourt found it was constitutional for a state legislature tobegin its session with prayer.""I don't see why one is good and the other isbad,"" said Justice Antonin Scalia.Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, often a swing vote when the justicesare closely divided, questioned how appropriate it would be if""the legislature itself wants to have the Ten Commandments displayedin its legislative halls.""When Chemerinsky said that would be unconstitutional, O'Connor complained ""it's sohard to draw that line.""If legislatures can open their sessions with prayers, O'Connor wondered howdisplaying the Ten Commandments in the same hall could beunconstitutional.The Kentucky case involves the constitutionality of Ten Commandments displays intwo county courthouses. The displays have been modified twice inresponse to lower court rulings against the exhibits.The first ones consisted of a framed copy of the TenCommandments. In its current version, the Ten Commandments are surroundedby historic American and British political and patriotic documents. Adescription in the final displays asserts the exhibits are of""documents that played a significant role in the foundation ofour system of law and government.""Opponents of the Kentucky exhibits argue county officials clearly had areligious purpose in posting the Ten Commandments and that thesubsequent modifications were little more than a ""sham"" designed toinsulate the displays from scrutiny.Justice David Souter said it seemed clear the displays were religiousin nature. ""There's no reason the intent of this displayhas changed as the context has changed,"" Souter said.But supporters argue the court should not give too much weightto the original intent of county officials in erecting thedisplays.Kentucky authorities were only trying ""to do the best they could""to follow previous court decisions, said Mathew Staver, who representedthe Kentucky counties. ""They have got to be able toadjust their missteps whenever they step on a constitutional landmine that is blurry and confusing.""Acting Solicitor General Paul Clement, who represented the Bush administration indefending the Texas and Kentucky displays, said ""municipalities should berewarded, not punished, for trying to change the context totry and get it right.""During the arguments Wednesday, justices appeared to struggle with how tojudge the Texas and Kentucky displays -- and whether asingle test could be constructed to decide when government-sponsored religiousexhibits or actions run afoul of the Constitution.Justice Stephen Breyer doubted the high court could fashion a one-size-fits-allsolution.""We are a religious nation,"" Breyer said. ""I think the onlyway to do it is to look at the divisivequality of the display on a case-by-case basis.""Even as justices weighed the issue, they noted that religious symbolsare displayed throughout the Supreme Court building. Above the dais,a large frieze depicts Moses holding the Ten Commandments --without text displayed. Other historic lawgivers -- including Chinese philosopherConfucius, Roman Emperor Caesar Augustus, and former Chief Justice JohnMarshall -- also are depicted on the panel.Supreme Court sessions also open with a clerk proclaiming: ""God savethe United States and this honorable court.""(Jennifer A.

WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court Wednesday wrestled with whether the Constitutionallows displays of the Ten Commandments on government property, bringingto a climax the latest battle in the culture warover the role of Christianity in the nation's public lifeand the exact line between church and state.Lawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union and a Texas plaintiffargued that the Ten Commandments presuppose the existence of aGod. Although the tablets can be displayed on government propertyin a secular context, they said, displays in Texas andKentucky went too far, violating the First Amendment's prohibition onestablishing an official state religion.But supporters of the displays argued that the Ten Commandments servea secular historic function as well as a religious one.They said the displays should be allowed to stay onthe Texas state capitol grounds and in a Kentucky countycourthouse.The arguments signaled little chance that the perennially contentious issue willbe definitively resolved. The justices showed no appetite for creatinga clear rule that state exhibits of the Ten Commandmentswill henceforth either always be allowed or always be forbidden.Instead, the arguments revolved around which legal doctrine should be usedto decide on a case-by-case basis, how the details ofthe two cases before the court fit those tests, andwhether those tests should be kept or modified.""Because of our religious traditions, there's no way to do itother than to look at divisive qualities on a case-by-casebasis,"" said Justice Stephen G. Breyer said. ""When I dothat, I don't find divisiveness here.""Not so, responded Erwin Chemerinsky, a lawyer arguing against the Texasdisplay. He noted that the chief justice of the AlabamaSupreme Court lost his job in 2003 for defying afederal order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from hisstate courthouse.""The Ten Commandments is enormously divisive today,"" he said. He alsonoted the hundreds of evangelical Christian protesters praying outside theSupreme Court walls and said he had received hate messagesin the past week.The Texas case involves a Ten Commandments monument on the capitolgrounds that was donated to the state four decades ago.The only one of 17 monuments on the grounds thathas a religious theme, it was formally endorsed by theLegislature.The Kentucky case involves a recent effort to exhibit the TenCommandments in a county courthouse as part of a ""FoundationsDisplay"" along with political and patriotic texts that are notreligious in nature. The first version contained only the commandments,and a second added excerpts from speeches and public documentsthat made specific reference to Christianity. The display in dispute,the third version, dropped the Christian references and added suchdocuments as the Magna Carta.The courthouse changed the display in response to a lawsuit bythe American Civil Liberties Union. A judge ruled that thenew display was unconstitutional, because the history showed that officials'clear intent was to post a religious document. The countiesasked the Supreme Court for a new test that looksat the effects of the display, not the intent ofits sponsors.The dispute also had personal overtones for the Supreme Court. Itscourtroom is replete with Ten Commandments imagery, from a friezethat includes Moses holding the tablets to several images oftwin tablets with Roman numbers from 1 to 10.Lawyers challenging the constitutionality of the Texas and Kentucky displays showedno desire to confront the high court about its ownuse of the iconography. They said the Supreme Court's useof the image was obviously of a secular nature, toacknowledge one source of law among many, while insisting thatthe Texas and Kentucky displays went too far.Nevertheless, the Supreme Court's use of commandments imagery was a regulartheme.Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg pointed to the frieze on the southwall of the courtroom, which depicts Moses with eight otherancient lawgivers. The tablets of Moses are tilted so onlythe second five commandments, all secular rules, such as ""Thoushalt not kill,"" are visible. Religious rules, such as ""Thoushalt not take the name of the Lord thy Godin vain,"" are hidden.Ginsberg asked whether an inscription of the secular rules without thetablets would be acceptable on government property. Chemerinsky said theywould be since those rules are also found in Texasstatutes. That led Justice Antonin Scalia to interrupt with ascoff: ""Who are you kidding? Everyone knows these come fromthe Ten Commandments.""Scalia, a devout Catholic, also took issue with the argument byAttorney General Greg Abbott of Texas that the display fromthat state serves a secular function. Scalia denounced the ideaof ""watering down"" the religious message of the Ten Commandments,which he said was ""government derives its authority from God,""and suggested that it would be a ""Pyrrhic victory"" ifTexas won on those grounds.Atheists should ""turn your eyes away if it's such a bigdeal to you,"" he added.The court's two swing voters, Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and SandraDay O'Connor, both appeared uneasy about the prospect of orderinggovernments to take down all of the thousands of TenCommandments displays around the country.Kennedy talked about ""an obsessive concern with any mention of religion""that would amount to impermissible ""hostility to religion."" O'Connor suggestedthat for older monuments and displays, the state's ""interest inpreserving old objects"" in a ""museumlike setting"" could be analternative justification for not tearing down Ten Commandments monuments.The court last addressed the issue in a Kentucky case in1980, striking down a state mandate that schools post copiesof the commandments.
The justices of the Supreme Court appeared to wrestlewith contradictory impulses as they heard arguments on Wednesday intwo cases challenging government displays of the Ten Commandments.On the one hand, they were searching for a broad principlethat could decide not only these particular disputes, but futureones as well. On the other hand, they appeared powerfullydrawn to deciding the two cases on their specific facts,even at the risk of inviting an endless parade offuture cases.Was the 22-acre park surrounding the Texas Capitol, where a TenCommandments monument sits among 16 other displays, all of themnonreligious, the equivalent of an outdoor museum or sculpture garden?Fine: maybe just such a mixed display might pass constitutionalmuster, even if a stand-alone Ten Commandments in a futurecase might prove more troublesome.Did it matter that the two Kentucky courthouses now seeking todisplay a framed Ten Commandments surrounded by nine nonreligious historicaldocuments had at first hung unadorned copies of the Commandmentsand did not add the other documents until after alawsuit was filed? If so, if that history provided theconstitutional taint that led a federal appeals court to orderremoval of the entire displays, then the answer to whethera display without such a history would be acceptable couldwait for another day.By the end of two hours of argument, it was notclear how the justices would resolve the problem they createdfor themselves when, after 25 years of silence on theTen Commandments, they agreed to decide these two cases. JusticeAntonin Scalia, unsurprisingly, expressed a definitive view, consistent with hislong-held position in religion cases. He called the Ten Commandments""a symbol of the fact that government derives its authorityfrom God,"" adding, ""That seems to me an appropriate symbolto put on government grounds.""But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who may well be in aposition to cast the deciding vote, appeared uncertain as shetried out various approaches to resolving the cases on narrowgrounds. Referring to the Texas monument, erected in 1961 bythe Fraternal Order of Eagles, she wondered aloud whether ""atsome point"" the preservation of an ""old object"" might itselfprovide an independent, nonreligious justification for keeping the Ten Commandmentson the Capitol grounds.The justices' visible struggle reflected the fact that the Supreme Court'sown precedents provide relatively little guidance on how to tellthe difference between religious displays that amount to an unconstitutional""establishment"" of religion and those that acknowledge religion in sucha minimal or contextual way that the Constitution is notoffended, even if some individuals are.In 1980, the court invalidated a Kentucky law that required theposting of the Ten Commandments in every public school classroom,but no one seemed to suggest that the old case,Stone v. Graham, provided an answer to the new ones.In the new cases, one federal appeals court upheld theTexas display even as another struck down the two inKentucky.Would it be permissible for the Texas Legislature to post theTen Commandments, not in an outdoor park, but in thehalls of the Capitol, O'Connor asked Erwin Chemerinsky, who wasrepresenting the Austin man who challenged the Texas display.No, replied Chemerinsky, a professor at Duke University Law School, becausethat would be a sign of government endorsement of religion.But the Supreme Court itself has upheld the practice of beginninga legislative session with a prayer, O'Connor pointed out.""It can't be that just because a prayer is permissible, everythingbecomes permissible,"" Chemerinsky replied, adding that a Legislature could notmount a large Latin cross on the top of astate Capitol.""It's so hard to draw the line!"" O'Connor exclaimed.Justice Stephen G. Breyer said he had reluctantly and tentatively cometo the conclusion that there was no way for thecourt to decide religious display cases other than by evaluatingthe divisive nature of the display on a case-by-case basis.The Ten Commandments are ""enormously divisive,"" Chemerinsky responded, urging that thecourt ""not ignore social reality."" He mentioned the crowds thatthe arguments themselves drew to the court, as well asthe dispute in Alabama two years ago over Chief JusticeRoy Moore's display of a large Ten Commandments monument inthe courthouse rotunda.Scalia asked whether the marshal's invocation that begins each Supreme Courtsession, ""God save the United States and this honorable court,""was not also ""divisive, because there are people who don'tbelieve in God.""Chemerinsky replied that it was important to draw a distinction between""minimal and maximum religious content."" The message of the TenCommandments was deeply religious he said: ""All of these areGod's commands to his people.""Justice David H. Souter asked whether a tablet containing only thelast five commandments, the injunctions against killing, stealing, and soon, might be constitutional because, unlike the first five, theydid not necessarily imply religious belief.That would be a harder case, Chemerinsky replied, but such atablet would still be unconstitutional because it would still conveythe Ten Commandments' message.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)What about a ""piece of stone"" simply carved with the various""thou shalt nots,"" Souter asked.That would be acceptable as a ""reflection of law"" rather thanreligion, Chemerinsky replied.""Who are you kidding?"" Scalia broke in, adding that ""everyone knows""that the reference would be to the Ten Commandments.""Context matters enormously,"" Chemerinsky said.Greg Abbott, the Texas attorney general, described the Ten Commandments asa ""recognized symbol of law"" and defended the state's displayas having the secular purpose of ""recognizing historic influences"" onthe legal system.The attorney general's argument distressed Scalia. ""You're watering it down tosay the only message is a secular message,"" the justicesaid. ""I can't agree with you. 'Our laws come fromGod.' If you don't believe it sends that message, you'rekidding yourself."" Later, Scalia told Abbott: ""I would consider ita Pyrrhic victory for you to win on the groundsyou're arguing.""In both the Texas case, Van Orden v. Perry, No. 03-1500,and the Kentucky case, McCreary County v. American Civil LibertiesUnion, No. 03-1693, the Bush administration argued on behalf ofthe displays. ""The Ten Commandments have an undeniable religious significance,but also a secular significance as a code of lawand a well recognized symbol of law,"" Paul D. Clement,the acting solicitor general, told the justices. He added: ""TheEstablishment Clause should not be interpreted to force the stateto send a message of hostility toward religion.""The question was one of degree, Clement suggested. In answer toa question from Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, he said thatMoore in Alabama ""probably"" crossed the constitutional line when heturned the courthouse rotunda into the equivalent of a ""religioussanctuary."" Clement added: ""The state can have a permissible acknowledgmentof religion, and I don't think in this case thestate of Texas has gone too far.""In defending the Kentucky courthouse displays, Mathew D. Staver, a lawyerwith Liberty Counsel, a Florida-based group associated with the Rev.Jerry Falwell, said the appeals court had ""ignored the overallcontext"" when it ordered the removal of courthouse displays thatcontained the Ten Commandments surrounded by the text of ninehistoric documents, including the Mayflower Compact.But it was the context that the justices probed, several dwellingon the original 1999 displays that contained the Ten Commandmentsalone. The two counties, McCreary and Pulaski, had decided to""switch rather than fight,"" Staver said, and should be ""rewarded,not punished, for trying to get things right.""But ""the courts cannot turn a blind eye to a shamsecular purpose,"" David A. Friedman, general counsel of the AmericanCivil Liberties Union of Kentucky, told the justices. He saida ""reasonable observer"" would know the history and understand thecounties' real purpose.
The marshal yelled ""God Save the United States andthis honorable court"" and the U.S. Supreme Court justices tooktheir seats in a room bearing a sculpted depiction ofMoses holding a Ten Commandments tablet.That backdrop became part of the questioning Wednesday as the justicesconsidered the ways in which government and religion intertwine duringoral arguments in two closely-watched cases from Texas and Kentucky.Their ruling, due by the end of June, is expectedto clarify when government may acknowledge religion and more specifically,under what circumstances it can display the Ten Commandments.One of the cases originated when Thomas Van Orden, a homelessformer lawyer, sued Texas officials in 2001, claiming that aTen Commandments monument near the rear entrance to the stateCapitol violated the constitutional separation between church and state. Helost at trial and then on appeal and the monumentremains.His lawyer, Duke University Law Professor Erwin Chemerinsky, was the firstto field questions from the justices.""What happens if (the Ten Commandments) are packaged in a museum-likesetting?"" asked Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, echoing an argument byTexas Attorney General Greg Abbott that the monument is oneof many on the grounds that shows different influences onTexas culture.""This isn't a museum-like setting,"" Chemerinsky said, dismissing Abbott's argument withone one of his own -- that the monument isin a uniquely prominent place on the Capitol grounds, awayfrom any other display.""Doesn't the venue count?"" asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, noting thatthere is a difference between prayer in schools -- whichthe court has struck down -- and a prayer toopen a legislative session, which the court has allowed.Chemerinsky agreed, saying that ""monument standing alone does convey the government'sendorsement for religion.""Justice Anthony Kennedy said he would be worried that any rulingby the court that showed ""obsessive concern with any messageof religion"" would suggest a ""hostility towards religion.""""This is a classic avert your eyes,"" Kennedy said. ""If anatheist walks by he can avert his eyes.""""I don't think so, your honor,"" Chemerinsky said, arguing that themessage conveyed by the monument is that the Texas governmentfavors Judeo-Christian religions above others.That, Chemerinsky said, would be a violation of the Establishment Clause,the part of the First Amendment that says ""Congress shallmake no law respecting an establishment of religion.""After Chemerinsky sat down, Abbott argued that the Ten Commandments area historically recognized ""symbol of law"" that are part ofan integrated display erected to honor a service organization's workwith juveniles. The monument, he added, has stood for 40years unchallenged before Van Orden brought his case.The Supreme Court decided to hear the Texas and Kentucky casesamid a national debate on religion's role in government. TenCommandments displays that have stood for decades in and nearcourthouses and other public buildings across the country have comeunder frequent attack by people and groups saying they violatethe Constitution.Defenders of the Ten Commandments displays, including the Bush Administration, saythe religious text has been important in developing the country'slegal and civic traditions.In the Kentucky case, two counties posted framed copies of theTen Commandments on the walls of two different courthouses. Theylater added other documents, including copies of the Magna Cartaand the Declaration of Independence. An appeals court ordered thoseTen Commandments displays removed.Lower courts have issued conflicting rulings in dozens of cases involvingTen Commandments displays in recent years.Those include a 2003 Alabama case that led Chief Justice RoyMoore to be removed from office for refusing to complywith a court order to remove a Ten Commandments monumentfrom the state judicial building.Moore supporters were among several hundred people who assembled Wednesday morningoutside the nation's highest court as temperatures hovered around freezingwith a stiff wind that made it feel ten degreescooler.""The Ten Commandments is part of our history; it's a Christianhistory,"" said Rod McDougal of San Diego, a Moore supporterwho has been traveling with the monument removed from theAlabama court building.Chris Clipper, a former Austinite who moved to a Washington suburblast year, paced the sidewalk as crowds lined up forthe few public seats in the white-columned Supreme Court building,carrying a sign proclaiming himself an atheist.""I think there should be a public forum where all viewsshould be heard, respected,"" said Clipper, 41.Inside the courtroom, Justice Antonin Scalia joined Kennedy in signaling clearsupport of the government's right to acknowledge religion.Scalia suggested during Chemerinsky's argument that there is no difference betweenreferencing God at the opening of Supreme Court hearings anderecting a Ten Commandments monument.""I think 90 percent (of Americans) believe in the Ten Commandmentsand I think 85 percent can't tell you what theyare,"" Scalia said, drawing laughs from people in the packedchamber. ""It's a symbol that government derives its authority fromGod.""Chemerinsky countered that while the inclusion of ""God"" in a prayermay be a symbol, displaying a religious text like theTen Commandments conveys a ""profound religious message.""As for the depiction of Moses -- who Christians believe receivedthe Ten Commandments from God on Mount Sinai -- ona frieze on a wall to the left of thejustices inside the Supreme Court chambers. Chemerinsky said it isconstitutional because it is included in a display of 15""great lawgivers."" The Texas monument would be constitutional if itwere displayed similarly.When it was Abbott's turn, Justice John Paul Stevens asked himwhether he would consider a crucifix of the same sizeand shape on the Capitol grounds constitutionally acceptable.Probably not, Abbott said, because it is ""not a historically recognizedsymbol of law . . . and does not senda message to all people.""Abbott fielded several questions about his legal argument that the TenCommandments are secular.""You are asking us to ignore the religious purpose?"" Kennedy asked.There is both a secular and a religious interpretation of thecommandments, Abbott said.O'Connor, widely believed to be the swing vote in the case,asked how the state could erect a monument on stategrounds and purport to not endorse its message.""Every monument on the Capitol grounds enjoys a state endorsement, doesn'tit?"" she asked.Abbott replied that only nine of 17 monuments bear the stateseal. The Ten Commandments monument does not, he said.Later, Acting U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement -- who spoke onbehalf of the Bush Administration -- echoed Abbott's claims.""The Ten Commandments have undeniable religious significance,"" he said. ""But theyalso have secular significance as a code of law.""Steven Kreytak writes for the Austin American-Statesman. E-mail: skreytak@statesman.com
The Ten Commandments monument on the Texas Capitol groundsshould remain because it is a cultural and historical symbolthat does not violate the separation of church and state,Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott told the U.S. Supreme CourtWednesday.But an attorney representing Thomas Van Orden, an Austin, Texas, homelesslawyer challenging the law, countered that the 40-year-old pink graniteslab sends a ""powerful religious message"" and defies years oflegal doctrine prohibiting a government endorsement of religion.Justices peppered both sides with pointed questions as the court confrontedchurch-state cases that could affect the display of religious symbolsat public sites across the country. The justices also hearda challenge to Ten Commandments exhibits in Kentucky courthouses.""I think 90 percent of Americans believe in the Ten Commandments,""said Justice Antonin Scalia, ""but 85 percent probably couldn't tellyou what they are.""The cases constituted the first Ten Commandments dispute to come beforethe court in a quarter-century and attracted dozens of third-partyparticipants, from atheists to religious groups. Hundreds of protesters fromat least a half-dozen states mustered on the Supreme Courtsteps, often kneeling in impromptu prayer services.More than a dozen onlookers, including out-of-town law students, spent thenight in windy, freezing temperatures to get seats to thelandmark arguments. Protesters, bundled against the biting chill, displayed theirsentiments with signs declaring, ""Keep Church and State Separate"" or""No Religious Test for Patriotism.""The challenge to the Texas monument drew an extra burst ofattention because of the man who waged it -- VanOrden, a Southern Methodist University graduate who is no longereligible to practice law. He slept in an Austin parkwhile spending his days in the Texas State Library preparingthe case.Van Orden, who filed his suit in 2002, was not presentfor the Supreme Court arguments, but his chief attorney, DukeUniversity law school professor Erwin Chemerinsky, said he and VanOrden have stayed in touch through almost daily e-mail exchanges.Chemerinsky agreed to handle the case for free after VanOrden called and asked his help.The Ten Commandments monument was donated to the Texas Legislature in1961 by the Fraternal Order of Eagles, a century-old civicorganization, to commemorate youth and denounce juvenile delinquency. The monumentis one of 17 memorials on the State Capitol groundsand sits halfway between the Capitol and the State SupremeCourt building.Abbott, making his first argument before the high court, contended thatthe Ten Commandments monument, while containing a sacred religious text,constitutes a cultural, historical and legal symbol by being clusteredwith a diverse array of other monuments. He described thesetting as an outdoor museum.But Chemerinsky argued that the monument serves no secular purpose and""impermissibly"" endorses religion. The 51-year-old law professor, acknowledging the emotionalintensity of the issue, also told the justices that hehas received hate mail because of his legal opposition tothe Texas monument.At issue is the Establishment Clause in the Constitution's First Amendment,prohibiting Congress from enacting any law establishing a government-sanctioned religion.The 10-word clause is the cornerstone of more than twocenturies of legal doctrine on the separation of church andstate.Justices interrupted frequently as the hourlong argument veered into hypothetical discussionson whether other religious-oriented expressions, such as an opening prayerbefore Congress or a Thanksgiving proclamation, would be banned undera strict interpretation of what constitutes religion. They also notedthat Moses and the Ten Commandments are part of adecorative historical carving along the ceiling of the Supreme Courtchambers.""I don't know why the one is good and the otheris bad,"" said Scalia, contrasting the Ten Commandments monument witha congressional prayer. During the subsequent arguments on the Kentuckycase, Scalia said sardonically: ""I don't know who we're addressingwhen we say, 'God Save this honorable court.' ""Justice Anthony Kennedy complained about ""an obsessive concern to any mentionof religion"" on public sites. ""This is a classic 'avertyour eyes,' "" he said. ""If an atheist walks by,he can avert his eyes.""Justice John Paul Stevens raised the possibility of posting a disclaimerthat the Ten Commandments and similar displays might have areligious connotation. Abbott said a disclaimer might help fend offlegal challenges but he later told reporters that he feltit would be unnecessary under Texas' argument that the Austinmonument is non-religious.Abbott, who was partially paralyzed when he was struck by afalling tree while jogging two decades ago, made his argumentsfrom his wheelchair. Stevens told Abbott that his presentation demonstrated""that it's not necessary to stand at the lectern inorder to do a fine job.""Ailing Chief Justice William Rehnquist was absent but Stevens, second inseniority, said Rehnquist ""reserves the right"" to participate in thedecision.Abbott, 47, a former state Supreme Court justice, declined to predictthe outcome of the case but several attorneys on bothsides of the issue said the justices' comments suggested thatthe court might support the state's arguments.""In the Texas case, they seemed more inclined to find thedisplay OK,"" said Steven Freeman of New York, an attorneywith the Anti-Defamation League, which supported Van Orden's challenge.(Visit the Star-Telegram's online services at www.star-telegram.com) nn
Win or lose, Thomas Van Orden savored themoment on Wednesday as the lawsuit he brought here threeyears ago was preoccupying the highest judges of the landin Washington.""What are the chances of this case making it to theSupreme Court?"" he asked from behind a borrowed computer atthe University of Texas law library. ""My God! My littlecase.""It is hardly little -- a constitutional challenge to displaying theTen Commandments on the grounds of the Texas Capitol, andso, a case that could rewrite aspects of church-state relationswhen the high court rules, perhaps this summer. But atany point in its journey up the legal ladder, VanOrden said, it might have failed for the unlikeliest ofreasons: a lack of paper, or postage.Van Orden, a suspended lawyer who put his age at 60,compiled the case while homeless, living in a tent ona wooded tract in Austin, surviving on food stamps, whilewriting his briefs at the law library and scrounging forwriting materials.""You can find paper and pens on the college campus,"" hesaid. ""Just look down.""At times, he said, he lacked the 10 cents to printout even one page of his briefs and did nothave the money to mail his appeal to the federalappeals court in New Orleans.But he disdained what he portrayed as the caricaturing of hisstory by journalists.""OK, so I did crawl in out of the woods,"" hesaid, ""but I brought some knowledge with me.""It is not about him, Van Orden said again and againin an interview on Wednesday, deflecting personal questions while talkinganimatedly about the legal issues and yet volunteering intriguing snippetsof biography that included a stint as a pilot.""It's not my lawsuit,"" he said. ""It's every American's.""Van Orden said he had turned down an offer by alawyer who argued his case, Erwin Chemerinsky, to pay fora trip to Washington to witness the argument.""I don't think I should accept anyone's money to go,"" hesaid.He also said that he had overcome an unspecified psychological problem,that he was eager for a steady job -- ""Youdon't actually think I like living in a tent, doyou?""-- and that he had gotten, and laughed off, offersfrom Hollywood for his story.""How do you do a movie of a guy at hisdesk researching legal briefs?"" he asked. ""There's no car chases,no exploding bombs.""But he said that if anyone persisted, ""I would say, 'Bringcash and tell me what time to meet your plane.""'Tall, with lanky, center-parted hair and a thick brush mustache --Van Orden, who declined to be photographed as well --said he had not gone looking for a cause. ""Thisone found me,"" he said.He said he had come across the Ten Commandments monument onthe Capitol grounds several years ago and, based on hisreadings of separation of powers cases thought: ""Something ought tobe done, and why not me? So I did it.""He said he was drawn to the case not by anyantipathy toward religion -- he was brought up Southern Baptist,he said -- but raised questions with a state preservationoffice and was told the display would not come down.""I never said, 'I demand you take it down,""' Van Ordensaid. ""I'm not rude.""But he did begin researching a federal lawsuit that he filedin 2002.""I was demonstrating what you could do with a pencil andpaper and a law book,"" Van Orden said.A graduate of Southern Methodist University's law school in Dallas, VanOrden said he had practiced criminal law in Houston, principallydefending drug dealers, until ""something happened to me"" that hesaid ""destroyed me.""Previously published articles said he fell prey to acute anxiety anddid not complete some cases he had been engaged tohandle, accounts he declined to discuss beyond saying, ""I neverstole a dime from anybody.""Texas State Bar records list him as suspended for ""disciplinary sanctions""and ""default in payment of Occupation Tax.""He said he had been divorced for 15 years and hada son and a daughter.Little by little, other details of Van Orden's life emerged. Hesaid he had served in the Vietnam-era Army and hadnarrowly avoided duty as a helicopter gunner by signing upas a lawyer in the judge advocate general's corps. Buthe said his brother, a Navy pilot who served onthe same aircraft carrier as Sen. John McCain, was shotdown and killed. Van Orden said he himself later becamea pilot flying light planes and training flight students andwalked away from at least one serious crash.He was always drawn to constitutional law, he said, and wasso enamored of Benjamin Nathan Cardozo, the former Supreme Courtjustice, that he named his son after him.In the Ten Commandments case, Van Orden said, the central questionswere: What was the government's purpose in putting up thedisplay in 1961, and what message did it send topeople? If religious, it was unacceptable, he said. Moreover, hesaid, the version of the commandments at the Capitol omitspart of the Hebrew text referring to God's covenant withthe Jews, raising another religious issue, he said.Van Orden lost in the district court and, after managing topay for enough copies and postage, appealed to the 5thU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, where healso lost. Then, he said, seizing on conflicting opinions bydifferent federal appeals courts, he asked the Supreme Court toresolve the issue.""That's what the Supreme Court does for a living,"" he said.Chemerinsky, a law professor at Duke University, said that after thehigh court agreed to hear the case in late 2003,Van Orden called him -- one of the rare timesVan Orden used a telephone -- and the two agreedto collaborate. Chemerinsky flew to Austin last November and withVan Orden walked the Capitol grounds, seeing the monument anddiscussing the case.""He was extremely knowledgeable in the law in this case,"" Chemerinskysaid.They did not discuss Van Orden's homelessness, he said, adding, ""Itwas none of my business.""They exchanged drafts by e-mail, Van Orden working at the Universityof Texas law library and the state law library, usinghis own e-mail accounts honoring his favorite Roman philosopher, Seneca.Van Orden derided the cliches of homelessness that he said reportershad unfairly stuck to him over the years. He didnot travel with bundles, he said, and he took pridein his clean clothes and grooming, which he attended toin ways he did not detail.""I'm surprised they don't have me trailing a yellow dog,"" hesaid, exaggerating.He ate on food stamps at the upscale Central Market, pitchedhis tent nightly and took it down each morning ina wooded location he did not specify, traveled on afree bus pass granted for a veteran's disability and readnewspapers and magazines free at newsstands.He said his happiest moment was not when he heard theSupreme Court was taking his case but when his teenagedaughter read the story and tracked him down by e-mail,breaking a long estrangement.
","On March 2, 2005 the Supreme Court faced the issue of whether display of the Ten Commandments (T.C.) at government buildings violates the principle of separation of church and state. Two cases from Texas and Kentucky raised several questions. Are the T.C. a religious statement, a part of legal history, or both? If courts and legislatures can call for God's help in invocations, what's wrong with displaying the T.C.? Does the appearance of the T.C. among other statuary constitute an endorsement? From justices' questions and remarks a split decision seemed likely. ","On March 2, 2005, the Supreme Court heard two cases concerning the display of the Ten Commandments on government property. In Texas, a homeless former lawyer challenged the constitutionality of an inscribed monument displayed on state capitol grounds. In Kentucky, the ACLU claimed copies displayed in two courthouses, modified twice before in response to court rulings, still violated the First Amendment because the original purpose was religious and the modifications were a sham. Supporters argued that the Ten Commandments are a recognized symbol of law, with both secular and religious functions. The justices will issue an opinion by late June. ","A homeless man, Thomas Van Orden, in Texas is challenging the constitutionality of a monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments and two stars of David on the Capitol grounds. A Kentucky case involves the constitutionality of Ten Commandments displays in two county courthouses. Opponents of the displays argue the displays violate the First Amendments prohibition on establishing an official state religion. Supporters argue the Ten Commandments serve a secular historic function as well as a religious one. The Bush administration has argued on behalf of the displays. Questioning by justices during hearings suggests they are headed for a split decision. ","The Supreme Court heard arguments in two cases on March 2nd about the conditions under which the government could display the Ten Commandments and whether such displays violated the First Amendment. The Texas case concerns a 40-year-old granite monument of the Ten Commandments, one of 17 monuments on the grounds of the state capital. The Kansas case concerns framed copies of the Ten Commandments which hang with non-religious documents in two county courthouses. The displays have been modified twice in response to lower court rulings. Justice O'Connor is expected to cast the swing votes. 
"
D0913,D0913-B,"The US political, religious and legal establishments are braced for two critical Supreme Court rulings on the Ten Commandments, weighing heavily on the separation of church and state.The decision, expected as early as Thursday, could inflame conservative evangelical groups or opposing civil liberties lobbies, and thrust the court squarely into partisan politics.And both sides of the divide will use whatever judgment day brings in the two cases to whip up partisans ahead of a looming battle over what could be imminent vacancies on the court bench.Each case is born out of the religious and cultural struggle raging in modern America between radical evangelicals and advocates of the secular state.The conservative religious right, a strong backer of President George W. Bush, argues that the country is a ""Christian"" state and decry attempts to deny that heritage.Civil liberties advocates however fear a tide of evangelical Christianity is eroding the politically sacred separation of church and state, and endangering the principle that all Americans, whatever their religion, are created equal.The more contentious question before the court, legal experts say, is a challenge to the display of framed copies in two Kentucky courthouses of the Ten Commandments, which Christians and Jews believe God handed to Moses on Mount Sinai.""This case will answer whether or not the government may hew to a particular religious viewpoint and chose Christianity because there have been Christians in our heritage,"" said Marci Hamilton of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, Yeshiva University.""Or whether the Supreme Court is going to take the heat, which it is going to get, and say there are some circumstances where the government cannot post the Ten Commandments despite their importance in our history and they must make it clear that every citizen is a citizen that is equal in the eyes of the law.""The second case surrounds the legality of a stone monument inscribed with the commandments and other religious symbols on the grounds of the Texas state legislature.This may be easier to resolve than the Kentucky situation, as the monument was placed in a display of other historical monuments and was a private donation.Therefore, justices could stake out a compromise position and argue that the display was not necessarily endorsed by the Texas state government, allowing it to fall within constitutional bounds.The US Constitution's first amendment establishes the principle of separation of church and state, but how this should be interpreted remains unclear following numerous contradictory decisions by lower courts.Justices may find a more delicate tightrope in the Kentucky case, as it was the government of McCreary County which put a plaque of the Ten Commandments in a courthouse, and defended the display through the courts.It would be hard to argue therefore that the state government did not endorse the display, prompting some experts to believe the Supreme Court may come up with a split judgment on the Texas and Kentucky cases.Differences over the cases were clear when the court took up the questions in March.Appearing to endorse the displays, conservative justice Antonin Scalia called them ""the symbol that government derives its authority from God.""""I see nothing wrong with the government reflecting that. We're a tolerant society,"" Scalia said.Liberal justice Stephen Breyer however countered that, although the US is a highly religious country, ""we are also committed to secularism.""
With demonstrators shouting religious slogans outside, Supreme Court justicesquestioned, argued and fretted over whether Ten Commandments displays ongovernment property cross the line of separation between church andstate.Back-to-back arguments in cases from Texas and Kentucky were the court's firstconsideration of the issue since 1980, when justices ruled the Ten Commandmentscould not be displayed in public schools.Clearly reluctant to adopt a blanket ban, the current justices wrestled onWednesday with the role that religious symbols should play in public life _right down to the Ten Commandments display in their own courtroom.Several expressed support for a 6-foot (1.8-meter) granite monument on thegrounds of the Texas state Capitol, but were less certain about framed copies ofthe commandments in two Kentucky courthouses.""If an atheist walks by, he can avert his eyes,"" Justice Anthony Kennedy said ina courtroom filled with spectators, many of whom could be seen glancing at thecourt's frieze of Moses carrying the tablets.Banning the Texas display might ""show hostility to religion,"" hesaid.But Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, while acknowledging thenation's religious history, wondered where the line should be drawn. The courtruled in 1983 that legislative prayer is allowable, citing its historicalsignificance, but in 1992 said prayer in public schools is not because studentsmay feel pressure to participate.What if every federal court had a Ten Commandments display over its bench andopened with a prayer, Ginsburg asked, brushing aside Justice Antonin Scalia'sretort that the justices already open their sessions with ""God save thishonorable court.""""We would try and defend that,"" said acting Solicitor General Paul Clement, whoargued on behalf of the Bush administration in supporting the Ten Commandmentsdisplays.A pivotal vote in the case is expected to be Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who inrecent years has been at the forefront in outlining constitutional tests basedin part on a symbol's history and ""ubiquity."" She did not tip her handWednesday, if she had one.""It's so hard to draw that line"" between allowing a legislative prayer and notallowing a Ten Commandments display, O'Connor fretted at onepoint.Monuments carrying the Ten Commandments are common in town squares, courthousesand other government-owned land around the country. Lawyers challenging thesedisplays argue that they violate the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment ban onany law ""respecting an establishment of religion.""While the cases strictly involve Ten Commandments displays, a broad ruling coulddetermine the allowable role of religion in a wide range of public contexts,from the use of religious music in a school concert to students' recitation of""under God"" in the Pledge of Allegiance. A decision is expected by lateJune.The question has prompted dozens of heated legal battles, including one inAlabama by Roy Moore. He lost his job as chief justice a year ago after defyinga federal order to remove a 5,300-pound (2,385-kilogram) Ten Commandmentsmonument he had installed in the state courthouse.At the Supreme Court, about 100 supporters of commandments displays gatheredoutside in the icy cold. Many shouted ""Amen"" and broke into refrains from thehymn ""Amazing Grace."" Several knelt before the court steps.Opponents of the displays, smaller in number, waved signs reading ""KeepGovernment and Religion Separate"" and ""My God Does Not Need Government Help.""According to an AP-Ipsos poll, 76 percent of Americans support such displays, afact that was not lost on some of the justices during arguments.""It's a profoundly religious message, but it's a profoundly religious messagebelieved in by a vast majority of the American people,"" Scaliasaid.In the Texas case, the Fraternal Order of Eagles donated the exhibit to thestate in 1961, and it was installed about 75 feet (22.5 meters) from the Capitolin Austin. The group gave thousands of similar monuments to American townsduring the 1950s and '60s, and those have been the subject of multiple courtfights.The suit was brought by Thomas Van Orden, a former lawyer who is now homeless.Van Orden, who enlisted the help of Duke law professor Erwin Chemerinsky in theappeal, said in an interview that he spent the morning at the University ofTexas law library playing chess online. He did not comment on thecase.Two Kentucky counties, meanwhile, hung framed copies of the Ten Commandments intheir courthouses and added other documents, such as the Magna Carta and theDeclaration of Independence, after the American Civil Liberties Union challengedthe display.While one lower court found the Texas display to be predominantly nonreligiousbecause it was one of 17 monuments in a 22-acre (8.8-hectare) park, anothercourt struck down the Kentucky displays as lacking a ""secular purpose.""Kentucky's modification of the display was a ""sham"" for the religious intentbehind it, the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsruled.Arguing against a strict wall between church and state, Solicitor GeneralClement said, ""The Ten Commandments have an undeniable religious significance,but they also have a secular significance as a source of the law, a code of thelaw and a well-recognized historical symbol of the law.""David Friedman, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who ischallenging the courthouse displays in Kentucky, countered: ""An assertion thatthe Ten Commandments is THE source, THE foundation of our legal system ... thatis simply wrapping the Ten Commandments in the flag, and that'sendorsement.""The Supreme Court's frieze depicts Moses as well as 17 other figures includingHammurabi, Confucius, Napoleon and Chief Justice John Marshall.When Stevens said the depiction is more neutral in part because it does notdisplay the Ten Commandments' text, Clement gently demurred. ""I don't know if adisplay of Moses might be sending more of a religious message.___On the Net:A transcript from the Supreme Court argument in Van Orden v. Perry is availableat:

The Supreme Court justices usually leave some of thehardest cases for the final month of the term, and this year is nodifferent. The court is due to decide 29 cases by the end of June,including nettlesome issues surrounding medical marijuana, the TenCommandments and the Internet.But this year, the term's end could be overshadowed by theretirement of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. Since October, hehas been battling thyroid cancer. And though his voice has soundedstronger in recent weeks, he is widely expected to announce soon thathe will step down at the end of the current term.On Tuesday, the court will meet to hand down rulings, and it islikely to issue decisions on one or two days each week for the rest ofJune.Here are key issues awaiting a decision:-- Ten Commandments. Can government officials prominently displaythe Biblical Commandments at public buildings or in courthouses todemonstrate the nation's religious heritage? Or does this officialdisplay amount to the government's promotion of religion in violationof the First Amendment? The court will rule on two cases: a TenCommandments monument outside the Texas state Capitol and plaquesfeaturing the Commandments posted in Kentucky courthouses.-- Medical marijuana. Can federal agents raid the homes ofCalifornia patients who grow marijuana for their own use? Although themedical use of marijuana is legal in California and nine other states,federal authorities say they can override those state laws. The 9thU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the federal officials had exceededtheir constitutional power.-- File sharing. Can film studios and record labels go to court toshutdown Internet-based companies that help computer users downloadfree copies of music and movies? This is a multibillion-dollarquestion of copyright law. The movie and record industries sayunchecked Internet piracy threatens to make copyrights meaningless.-- Internet access. Must cable and phone companies allow outsidecompanies, such as Earthlink, to offer broadband Internet service tocustomers, or may they instead reserve their lines for their ownbroadband service? A divided Federal Communications Commission saidcable companies can keep exclusive control of their lines. If the FCCprevails, it plans to adopt the same rule for phone companies. Theoutcome may determine how much choice consumers will have in Internetaccess.-- Property rights. May cities seize private property to make wayfor business development? This Connecticut case could limit thegovernment's power of ``eminent domain.'' The Constitution saysofficials may take possession of private property ``for public use,''and the homeowners who are fighting the city of New London say thatprivate development is not a public use.-- Restraining orders. Can the police be sued for failing enforce arestraining order? The case before the court is tragic -- a motherwhose three daughters were murdered by her estranged husband -- butduring the oral argument the justices were skeptical of the claim thatthe police can be held liable for not acting in time.-- Religion in prison. Can Congress require state prisons to makespecial accommodations for the religious needs of their inmates? Fiveyears ago, a bipartisan group of lawmakers won passage of a new law tofurther religious liberty, but prison officials have opposed it.-- Juries and race. What should judges do if prosecutors removeseveral blacks from the jury pool? The court has said the Constitutionforbids racial bias in selecting jurors, but it has struggled on howto enforce that rule. Two cases raise this issue.-- Drug research. Can scientists make use of patented drugs anddevices while researching new drugs? A 1984 law exempted such researchfrom charges of patent infringement, but that law has been readnarrowly to cover only research data to be presented to the Food andDrug Administration. Researchers at the Scripps Institute in La Jolla,Calif., were hit with a $15 million judgment for patent infringement.(-- Cruise ships. Does the federal law that protects disabledAmericans from discrimination apply to passengers who travel onforeign-flagged cruise ships? This case tests the reach of U.S. law.
Supreme Court justices voiced concern Wednesday during arguments ina lawsuit over a Ten Commandments monument in Austin, Texas,that efforts to preserve separation of church and state couldreach a ""hostility toward religion.""Justices seemed to grapple for a standard that would keep governmentfrom endorsing a particular religion, without eradicating America's historical andcultural ties to religion in a case brought by ThomasVan Orden, a Texas man who said he was offendedby the display of the biblical edicts on the Capitolgrounds.That case, along with a companion lawsuit from Kentucky argued Wednesday,could result in a far-reaching new definition of when itis appropriate for words or symbols with religious content tobe displayed in courthouses, schools and other public buildings.Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, making his first-ever argument before theSupreme Court, said that the commandments should be seen asa ""recognized symbol of law"" and not as an endorsementby the state of a particular religion.Justice Sandra Day O'Connor noted that the high court had alreadydecided that Congress and state legislatures can begin their daywith a prayer. ""It is so hard to draw thatline if the legislature can open its session with aprayer but can't display the Ten Commandments"" on the statehousegrounds, she said.Justice Anthony Kennedy worried that efforts to extinguish all religious displayson government property were ""obsessive"" and could amount to a""hostility toward religion"" by the high court.He wondered aloud why someone who was offended by the wordsof the commandments couldn't simply look away.Erwin Chemerinsky, a Duke University law professor who argued the casefor Van Orden, told the justices, ""This monument, standing alone,does convey the state's endorsement of religion."" And, as fornonbelievers simply ignoring the monument, Chemerinsky said, it wasn't thatsimple.The display created an atmosphere where ""some feel like insiders andsome feel like outsiders.""At issue is a red granite monument donated to Texas in1961 by the Fraternal Order of the Eagles. That groupdonated hundreds of the commandment statues to state and localgovernments all across America.The Austin case reached the high court on appeal after alower court ruled the monument did not violate the so-calledEstablishment Clause in the Constitution, which says, ""Congress shall makeno law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting thefree exercise thereof.""Since 1980, more than two dozen courts have ruled on displaysof the Ten Commandments in government settings. Those cases havecreated a contradictory legal thicket that the justices seemed eagerto cut through with a decisive ruling.But if consensus was emerging among the justices on a formulathat would achieve that goal, it was not evident duringquestioning Wednesday.Abbott, 47, was grilled by the justices as he argued thatthe Austin monument should be seen as part of the""museum-like"" display of Lone Star history on the grounds thatalso includes tributes to the Alamo, Texas pioneer women, Confederateveterans and others.""I was pleased we were able to get across to thecourt our message that what the monument does is acknowledgereligion's role in state history without endorsing religion,"" Abbott saidafter the session ended.Asked how he thought the state would fare when an opinionis delivered by the court sometime later this year, hesaid, ""I realize that you can't make predictions based oncomments from the bench.""Van Orden, who brought the case, declined to be interviewed Wednesday.He was in Texas as the case was argued.Some justices seemed skeptical of Abbott's argument that the Ten Commandmentswere not basically a religious expression. And surrounding the commandmentswith other memorials didn't necessarily change the message being sentto the public. ""It would be crazy law from thiscourt that said you can engage in religious (display) aslong as you hide the ball well enough,"" said JusticeDavid Souter.As lawyers and justices debated, the image of Moses holding thedisputed tablets peered down from a vanilla marble frieze inthe chamber, part of a majestic tableau, including Hammurabi andConfucius, honoring the development of law.That portrayal of the commandments, in which some of the textcan be seen in Hebrew, served as a backdrop formany of the questions Wednesday.Lawyers opposed to the Ten Commandments displayed in Austin and intwo Kentucky courthouses said the context of the Supreme Courtcarving made it acceptable, but to have the commandments standingalone sent a different message -- that there was astate-sanctioned religion in America.Justice Antonin Scalia noted that public opinion polls show at leastthree quarters of Americans support the display of the TenCommandments. He asked why a minority opposed to the displayshouldn't be ""tolerant of the majority.""The debate inside the high court unfolded as a more stridentwar of words raged outside in the frigid March air.Those passionately opposed to removing the statue and those justas fervently committed to seeing it go held rallies, amidcardboard commandments and signs noting, ""Atheists Have Rights Too.""The Rev. Aubrey Vaughan, a pastor at Houston's Grace Baptist Church,was carrying a stack of paper that contained 5,000 signatureshe'd collected since last year in support of the TenCommandments monument. ""Support is overwhelming in Texas. Even people whoaren't very religious said the monument should stay. It doesn'tharm anybody,"" he said.Eric Herrman of Millersville, Md., of the American Atheists, a groupsupporting the rights of atheists, said, ""As an atheist, Ifeel like a second-class citizen. The government should not favorany religion.""One possible narrow solution to the Texas case emerged during thequestioning when Justice John Paul Stevens suggested the state simplyadd a disclaimer to the statue saying it was notmeant as an endorsement of religion.Abbott said that disclaimer was already implied by the words onthe statue noting it was a gift from the Eagles,and by the lack of a Texas state seal.
After more than two decades of dodging thequestion, the U.S. Supreme Court this week heard oral argumentson whether Ten Commandments displays in courthouses and other publicspace are compatible with the First Amendment to the Constitution.The cases before the court involve a Ten Commandments monumenton the grounds of the Texas Capitol and a displayof the commandments in a Kentucky courtroom.The positions of the respective advocates are well known. Maybe asolution, some of the justices seemed to suggest with theircomments and questions from the bench, lies somewhere in themiddle.""It's so hard to draw that line,"" said Justice Sandra DayO'Connor.Justices seemed eager to stake that middle ground, wherever it mightlie. But by not decisively ruling for one side orthe other, the Supreme Court would be doing a disserviceto the nation. This important question of religious freedom demandsa clear answer from the high court.Those who favor Ten Commandments displays take one of two tacksor a combination of the two. They argue either thatsuch displays only celebrate the religious and legal heritage ofthe United States; or as, put forth by former AlabamaChief Justice Roy Moore and some evangelicals, nothing in theConstitution prohibits government acknowledgment of God, with the Ten Commandmentsor other religious displays.Opponents' reading of the First Amendment's ""establishment clause,"" however, leaves nosuch room.""An assertion that the Ten Commandments is the source, the foundationof our legal system ... that is simply wrapping theTen Commandments in the flag, and that's endorsement,"" argued DavidFriedman, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, beforethe high court on Wednesday.The search for a middle ground is attractive, if only becauseboth extremes can be troubling.It is difficult to imagine how displays of the Ten Commandmentsin courthouses or other government buildings can be taken asanything other than a government endorsement of a particular religiousviewpoint. That officials added non-religious documents to the offending displayin Kentucky after a lawsuit was filed reveals that intent.Ironically, though, advocates of Ten Commandments displays are willing to downplaytheir religious significance of the precepts and instead argue theirsecular value as, what Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott called,a ""recognized symbol of law.""So which is it, and why are supporters so willing todenigrate the Commandments' religious power to make their case?Justice Antonin Scalia wants to know. In response to Abbott, Scaliasaid, ""You're watering it down to say the only messageis a secular message. ... I can't agree with you.'Our laws come from God.' If you don't believe itsends that message, you're kidding yourself.""Scalia said that if Abbot's view were to prevail, it wouldbe a ""Pyrrhic victory.""Some on the other side are guilty of a similar cheapening,this time of the First Amendment. I agree with thosewho see Ten Commandments displays in courthouses or on thegrounds of the Texas Capitol as an affront to theFirst Amendment, but that does not mean all religious expressionon public property -- or even the mentioning of ""God""in the Pledge of Allegiance or on our money --threatens the republic.By using a one-size-fits-all argument, whether against the Ten Commandments or""In God We Trust,"" civil libertarians and others sometimes looksilly. Yes, ""under God"" was added to the Pledge ofAllegiance in 1954 to counter the ""God-less"" communists, but thatdid not make a pledge a prayer inappropriate for apublic school or anywhere else.As an insult to the Constitution, it is nothing compared toa clearly religious monument in a public courthouse or onthe grounds of the Texas Capitol.""These are not simple messages, like 'In God We Trust,""' onU.S. currency, said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. ""The Ten Commandmentsare a powerful statement of the covenant God made withhis people.""The First Amendment was written to guarantee Americans the right toworship, or not worship, as they want, and to bangovernment from establishing or endorsing a particular faith. Government breachesthe First Amendment's ""wall"" between church and state when itreserves for the public space a monument with a clearreligious message.There is no middle ground on that.Marc R.

For the third week in a row, the Rev.Rob Schenck set up a podium and a large woodand marble display of the 10 commandments outside the U.S.Supreme Court on Monday, in anticipation that the high courtwould rule on two cases that challenge displays of theDecalogue on public property.But after the justices announced their decisions in six other cases-- none of which tackled the contentious issue of religiousdisplays -- Schenck packed up and headed off.Schenck, the head of the conservative National Clergy Council, said heplans to return Thursday, the next day the Supreme Courtis expected to hand down decisions. He wants to bethere so that he can give reporters his group's interpretationon the court's decisions in the 10 commandments cases, amongthe most anticipated rulings this year.""We've been through this drill so many times,"" said Schenck, whohas waited outside the court building in the waning weeksof previous terms for decisions involving gay rights and abortion.""The court is a very disciplined branch of government. Theykeep everybody -- including some internal people -- on pinsand needles.""Schenck will be dueling with activists on the other side ofthe debate. For example, Barry W. Lynn, executive director ofAmericans United for Separation of Church and State, also hascamped out at the court building on recent Mondays, readyto respond to a ruling.No one outside the court knows for sure when the decisionwill be handed down -- so the partisans show upat the Supreme Court just in case.Although the Supreme Court gives as much as a week's noticebefore the so-called ""decision days,"" it does not say inadvance which rulings it will issue. With 11 cases stillundecided by the court -- and the panel's October 2004term set to end next week -- throngs of advocates,lawyers and reporters are on edge.In addition to issuing a verdict on the constitutionality of government-sponsoreddisplays of the 10 commandments, the court is expected todecide whether companies can be held liable for making computersoftware used to illegally download copyrighted music and movies. Thecourt also is set to rule whether the city ofNew London, Conn., violated the Constitution when it seized privateproperty for redevelopment.The Supreme Court typically issues its most anticipated rulings each yearin the final days of June, before taking its annualthree-month break.Tom Goldstein, a lawyer with the Washington, D.C., firm Goldstein &Howe who has argued before the Supreme Court, said theend-of-term rulings are typically ""the most hard-fought cases, where [thejustices] are going back and forth, back and forth withtheir opinions"" until the very last minute.This year, the anticipation is especially intense because many believe ChiefJustice William H. Rehnquist will decide to step down fromthe court after 33 years on the bench. Rehnquist, 80,began treatment late last year for thyroid cancer. If hedecides to retire, Rehnquist could announce the move before theend of the month.In a bid to catch the attention of the cameras andreporters at the building, Schenck's props include a two-foot bythree-foot replica of the 10 commandments tablets. He also hasplenty of paper -- including at least three versions ofnews releases that cover possible outcomes.""This is one of the most critical issues of our time;it has so much to say about what role religionwill play in the future of our country,"" Schenck said.""So much of the public's impression of these opinions comesin the way they're presented in the press, so wetry to be out there immediately to give our perspectiveon it.""(Jennifer A.

Sixty-two decisions down, 12 to go.The Supreme Court's 2004-2005 term, dominated by months of speculation overChief Justice William H. Rehnquist's health and retirement plans, willend as soon as next Monday. As usual, several ofthe most contentious cases will be among the final rulings.After announcing six decisions on Monday, the court has scheduled Thursdayand next Monday as decision days. If necessary, the justiceswill add another day next week. These are the remainingcases:Ten Commandments: Perhaps the most closely watched cases are two thatrequire the court to define the constitutional boundaries for governmentaldisplay of religious symbols. The appeal in Van Orden v.Perry, No. 03-1500, challenges the display of a Ten Commandmentsmonument on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol. InMcCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union, No. 03-1693, thequestion is the constitutionality of displays on the walls oftwo Kentucky county courthouses that include the text of theTen Commandments along with historical documents, such as the MayflowerCompact.File sharing: In a case of enormous interest to the entertainmentand recording industries, the question in Metro Goldwyn Mayer Studiosv. Grokster Ltd., No. 04-480, is whether the companies thatprovide the software that enables computer users to share illegallydownloaded files of copyrighted material are themselves liable for copyrightinfringement.Internet access: In National Cable and Telecommunications Association v. Brand XInternet Services, No. 04-277, the court will review the FederalCommunications Commission's determination that companies offering broadband access through cablemodem service do not have to permit competing Internet serviceproviders to share their lines. Industry groups say the shapeof future Internet access could depend on this decision.Private property: A closely watched case from New London, Conn., questionsthe government's use of the power of eminent domain totake, and pay for, private property for the purpose offostering private economic development. The question in the case, Kelov. City of New London, No. 04-108, is whether suchdevelopment fits the definition of ""public use"" for which theFifth Amendment permits a ""taking"" of private property.Domestic violence: The court will decide in Town of Castle Rockv. Gonzales, No. 04-278, whether a police department can beheld liable for violating a victim's rights when harm ensuesfrom a failure to enforce a court's order of protection.In this case, a woman's estranged husband violated a protectiveorder and kidnapped and killed their three daughters.Jurisdiction: The court will decide whether the federal courts have jurisdictionover certain kinds of class-action cases. Two related appeals arelikely to be decided by a single decision. They areOrtega v. Star-Kist Foods Inc., No. 04-79, and Exxon Corp.v. Allapattah Services Inc., No. 04-70.Water rights: In Orff v. United States, No. 03-1566, the courtwill decide whether the federal government can be sued byfarmers claiming a breach of contract in the delivery ofwater from the Central Valley reclamation project in California.Right to counsel: The question in Halbert v. Michigan, No. 03-10198,is whether indigent defendants have a right to a government-appointedlawyer to challenge aspects of a guilty plea.Habeas corpus: In another criminal appeal, Gonzalez v. Crosby, No. 04-5432,the question is whether a defendant can use a petitionfor a writ of habeas corpus as a means forreopening certain earlier judgments.Time limits: In Mayle v. Felix, No. 04-563, the question ishow the one-year time limit in the federal law governinghabeas corpus petitions applies to a defendant's effort to addnew claims to an existing petition.Death penalty appeal: In Bell v. Thompson, No. 04-514, a deathpenalty case from Tennessee, the court will address the authorityof a federal appeals court, on the basis of newlydiscovered evidence that is favorable to the defense, to changeits mind and order a case reopened as the stateis preparing to carry out a death sentence.
The Supreme Court ruled Monday that displaying the TenCommandments on government property does not necessarily violate the constitutionalprinciple that there must be a separation between church andstate.In a pair of 5-4 rulings, the court said the displayof the Ten Commandments in a 22-acre park at theTexas State Capitol was proper, but that the displays ofthe Commandments in two county courthouses in Kentucky were soovertly religious as to be impermissible.The rulings, the first by the court in a quarter-century onthe emotional issue of the proper place of the Commandmentsin American life, conveyed the message that disputes over suchreligious displays must be decided case by case, and thatthe specific facts are all important.Writing for the court, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist noted thatat the Texas Capitol in Austin, a six-foot monolith displayingthe Commandments was just one of 17 sculptures. ""The inclusionof the Commandments monument in this group has a dualsignificance, partaking of both religion and government, that cannot besaid to violate the Establishment Clause,"" the chief justice wrote.Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Stephen G.Breyer sided with the chief justice, with Justice Breyer callingthe Texas dispute a difficult borderline case. The dissenters werejustices Sandra Day O'Connor, John Paul Stevens, David H. Souterand Ruth Bader Ginsburg.The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment decrees that ""Congress shallmake no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibitingthe free exercise thereof,"" and the Supreme Court has longheld that the same rule must be applied to thestates.""While the Commandments are religious, they have an undeniable historical meaning,""Rehnquist wrote. ""Simply having religious content or promoting a messageconsistent with a religious doctrine does not run afoul ofthe Establishment Clause.""But he added pointedly, ""There are, of course, limits to thegovernment's display of religious messages or symbols.""And those limits were exceeded in the Kentucky displays, the courtheld in an opinion by Justice Souter and joined byjustices Stevens, O'Connor, Ginsburg and Breyer. ""The reasonable observer couldonly think that the counties meant to emphasize and celebratethe religious message,"" the majority held. ""The display's unstinting focuswas on religious passages, showing that the counties posted theCommandments precisely because of their sectarian content.""Dissenting were Chief Justice Rehnquist and justices Scalia, Thomas and Kennedy.The backgrounds of the Texas and Kentucky disputes were different ina way that the court found vitally important. The TexasTen Commandments monument was donated in 1961 by the FraternalOrder of Eagles and was just one of thousands donatedby the fraternity across the country with the support ofCecil B. DeMille, the director, who was promoting his movie""The Ten Commandments."" Thomas Van Orden, a suspended lawyer, challengedthe display in a lawsuit filed in 2002, after hebecame homeless.The four decades between the erection of the monument and thechallenge strongly suggest that there was little perception among thepublic that the Austin display was a government attempt toestablish religion, the justices in the majority reasoned.The crucial difference in the Kentucky case was that the Commandmentswere first displayed by themselves on the courthouse walls, andgovernment officials did not display accompanying historical documents until afterthe American Civil Liberties Union complained about the Commandments exhibits.""An observer would probably suspect the counties of reaching for anyway to keep a religious document on the walls,"" themajority observed.The majority noted that neither a federal district court nor theU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit had foundany ""valid secular purpose"" in the courthouse Commandments displays. Inthe Texas case, on the other hand, both a districtcourt and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals hadagreed that there was a valid secular purpose to thedisplays.The Texas case is Van Orden v. Perry, No. 03-1500. Gov.Rick Perry is named in his capacity as chairman ofthe State Preservation Board. The Kentucky case is McCreary Countyv. the ACLU of Kentucky, No. 03-1693.The last time the Supreme Court ruled on a Ten Commandmentscase was in 1980, when it invalidated a Kentucky lawthat required the posting of the Ten Commandments in everypublic school classroom.
A 6-foot-tall granite monument of the Ten Commandments outsidethe Texas capitol building is constitutional, but smaller displays ofthe Decalogue inside two Kentucky county courthouses must go, theSupreme Court ruled in separate decisions Monday.The court said the purpose of the displays was the dividingline in the two cases as the justices weighed whetherthe exhibits violated the Constitution's First Amendment bar against governmentpromotion of religion.In the Texas case, the court ruled 5-4 that the tablet-shapedmonument was constitutional because it was part of a comprehensive,historical presentation on the state capitol grounds, one of 38monuments and historical markers on the site.Although the monument ""has religious significance,"" the Ten Commandments also ""havean undeniable historical meaning,"" Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrotein an opinion joined by Associate Justices Antonin Scalia, AnthonyM. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. Justice Stephen Breyer concurred ina separate opinion.""Simply having religious content or promoting a message consistent with areligious doctrine does not run afoul of the establishment clause,""Rehnquist wrote.In the Kentucky cases, the court ruled 5-4 that county officialsstepped over the line because they had religious motives whenthey approved the construction of two displays of the TenCommandments.Breyer was the crucial swing vote, siding with conservative justices insupport of the Texas monument, but joining the court's moreliberal members to outlaw the Kentucky displays.Legal scholars and public officials had hoped the Supreme Court woulduse the two cases to clear up years of confusionabout what kind of religious displays are allowed on governmentproperty, but the issue was further muddled by the Texasand Kentucky decisions.The court appeared to acknowledge that point, with Rehnquist noting inhis opinion in the Texas case that there was nodefinitive formula for assessing the constitutionality of government-sponsored religious displays.In effect, the court said, it would have to sortout the principles one case at a time.Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation ofChurch and State, which opposed both displays of the commandments,said the split decisions ""just guarantee there will be farmore lawsuits and far more confusion about religious displays onpublic property.""For years, the Supreme Court has struggled with whether to loweror raise the wall separating government and religion but aclear guide for the future has remained elusive. Although thecourt has ruled that legislatures can open their sessions withprayers and has upheld state and local laws barring thesale of alcohol on Sundays, it also has struck downa law mandating that the Ten Commandments be displayed inschoolrooms.In his opinion in the Texas case, Rehnquist acknowledged the difficultyin defining the line.""Our institutions presuppose a supreme being, yet these institutions must notpress religious observances upon their citizens,"" Rehnquist wrote. The courtmust ""neither abdicate our responsibility to maintain a division betweenchurch and state, nor evince a hostility to religion bydisabling the government from in some ways recognizing our religiousheritage.""As evidence of the difficulty in reaching consensus, the nine justicestogether issued seven separate opinions in the Texas case andthree in the Kentucky case.""I didn't know we had that many people on our court,""Rehnquist quipped Monday.In the Kentucky case, the court based its ruling on thehistory of the displays in two county courthouses; the exhibitswere modified twice in response to a lawsuit and alower court ruling against the displays, steps that Justice DavidSouter -- writing for the majority -- said were designedto conceal the basic religious motivation behind the display. Inaddition to Breyer, Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, John Paul Stevensand Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined Souter in the majority.The first exhibits, created in 1999, consisted of framed copies ofthe Ten Commandments in the McCreary County courthouse in WhitleyCity, Ky., and the Pulaski County courthouse in Somerset, Ky.Later, county officials added excerpts of other historical documents containing religiousreferences, including passages from the Declaration of Independence, the preambleto the state constitution and a proclamation by former PresidentAbraham Lincoln.In its final version, the Ten Commandments were surrounded by historicAmerican and British political and patriotic documents and a statementasserting that the commandments ""have profoundly influenced the formation ofWestern legal thought.""Nonetheless, Souter said there was ""ample support"" for a lower court'sfinding ""of a predominantly religious purpose"" behind the displays.Although Kentucky officials described the display as including documents ""foundational"" toAmerican government, the collection was not comprehensive, Souter wrote. Theonly real connection is that materials included religious references, Soutersaid.An observer ""would probably suspect that the counties were simply reachingfor any way to keep a religious document on thewalls of courthouses constitutionally required to embody religious neutrality,"" Souterwrote.In a dissenting opinion, Scalia blasted the court's majority, arguing that""the commandments have a proper place in our civil history.""On the bench Monday, Scalia took the unusual step ofreading his dissent in the courtroom, prefacing his comments bysaying the court's ruling against the Kentucky displays ""ratchets upthis court's hostility to religion.""""Invocation of the almighty by our public figures, at all levelsof government, remains commonplace,"" Scalia wrote, noting that even insidethe Supreme Court building, Moses is depicted holding the TenCommandments and that court sessions open with a clerk proclaiming""God save the United States and this honorable court.""In other decisions on the final day of the Supreme Court's2004 term, the justices:-- Unanimously decided that makers of software that can be usedto illegally download copyrighted music and movies can be heldliable when they ""foster infringement."" The ruling is a victoryfor the entertainment industry, which has complained that widespread downloadingof movies and music is hurting their bottom line. Thecourt said the makers of file-sharing programs Grokster and Morpheushad acted in bad faith by promoting their products astools for illegally obtaining copyrighted content. Companies who make andmarket products legitimately -- only later learning they are beingused for illegal purposes -- would not be liable, thecourt said.-- Declined to review an appeal by New York Times reporterJudith Miller and Time magazine reporter Matthew Cooper, who facejail time for refusing to testify about confidential news sources.The court's decision, which was made without comment, sends Millerand Cooper's case back to U.S. District Court, which couldorder the reporters' imprisonment this week. To put the caseon the court's docket for the 2005 term, which beginsin October, at least four justices would have to votein favor of considering the case.-- Ruled 6-3 that cable companies offering high-speed Internet access donot have to open up their infrastructure to other Internetservice providers.(Jennifer A.

","On June 27, 2005 the Supreme Court, in a pair of 5-4 rulings, found that the display of the Ten Commandments (T.C.) in a park at the Texas State Capitol was proper, but the displays in the County Courthouses in Kentucky were so overtly religious as to be impermissible. The rulings made it clear that such disputes must be decided case by case with specific facts determining whether there is a violation of the Establishment Clause. Justice Breyer was the swing vote as the only justice voting with the majority in both cases. ","While hearing arguments, Supreme Court justices seemed to grapple for a standard which would keep the government from endorsing a religion without eradicating America's historical and cultural ties to religion. On June 27, the court ruled that displaying the Ten Commandments on government property does not necessarily violate the constitutional principle of separation between church and state. They ruled that the monument displayed at the Texas Capitol, one of thousands donated across the country and displayed along with 16 other secular sculptures, was proper. However, they ruled that the courthouse displays in Kentucky were overtly religious and therefore impermissible. ","The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the display of the Ten Commandments on Texas Capitol grounds did not violate constitutional principles. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote for the court and was joined by Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas and Breyer. Justices O'Connor, Stevens, Souter and Ginsburg dissented. In the Kentucky case, the prevailing opinion was that the Commandments display in two county courthouses was overtly religious and thus impermissible. Justice Souter wrote the opinion and was joined by Justices Stevens, O'Connor, Ginsburg and Breyer. The rulings conveyed the message that disputes over religious displays must be decided on a case by case. ","The Supreme Court made two separate 5-4 decisions regarding displays of the Ten Commandments, leaving the issue to be decided on a case-by-case basis. Justice Breyer cast the critical swing vote in both cases. The Court ruled that the Texas display was constitutional because it was one of 17 monuments, it had historical as well as religious significance, and it had been there for over 40 years without challenge. In contrast, in Kentucky the Commandments were initially displayed alone; the accompanying historical documents were added in response to a lawsuit, seemingly to hide a religious motivation. "

""There wasbloody everywhere.""Israeli police said the explosion was caused by a powerful car bombdetonated near the entrance to the four-star Hilton, destroying awing of the building.South Sinai governor General Mustafa Afifi said two charred truckswere found at the Shitani and Ras Soltan camps on the coast roadsouth of Taba, indicating that the blasts were also caused by carbombs.Egypt threw up a security cordon around the blast sites in the Sinai-- renowned for its dramatic desert mountains and palm-fringedbeaches -- and boosted airport security in Cairo.A previously unknown Islamist group claimed responsibility for theHilton blast in a telephone call to AFP in Jerusalem.""Jamaa Al-Islamiya Al-Alamiya (World Islamist Group) claimsresponsibility for the explosion at the Taba hotel, carried out inrevenge for the Palestinian and Arab martyrs dying in Palestine andIraq,"" the caller said.The explosions came amid a massive Israeli army offensive in thenorth of the Gaza Strip, a wedge of land near the border with Egypt,that has left 93 Palestinians dead in less than 10 days.Resorts dotted along the Sinai's desert coast have remained popularholiday spots for Israelis since the territory was handed back toEgypt as part of a 1979 peace deal, the first between Israel and anArab country.But Taba, which in ancient times was once a resting point forcaravans en route to the Fort of Aqaba, was excluded from Israel's1982 handover of the Sinai and was only returned in 1989 after yearsof wrangling following a ruling by the International Court ofJustice.Ties between  security agency, told the cabinet on September 19 thatprompt action had thwarted a plot by Palestinian militant group Hamasto strike Israeli tourists in the Sinai.Hamas had threatened to strike Israeli targets abroad after thekilling of a top militant in the Syrian capital of Damascus lastmonth that was blamed on Israel.
Israel will help evacuate any of the 12,000 to 15,000 Israelis whowish to leave Egypt's Sinai Peninsula in the wake of several deadlyexplosions, an Israeli foreign ministry spokeswoman said Friday.""There is a plan to send buses to help them evacuate, those who wantto,"" said the ministry's Rachel Shani.Three explosions shook popular resorts on Egypt's Sinai Peninsula onThursday night as many Israelis vacationed at the close of a Jewishholiday. Hospital officials said at least 29 people were killed, andwitnesses gave unconfirmed reports that all three explosions werecaused by car bombs.Egyptian security officials said there was no evidence of terrorism,but Israel's army radio said officials believed the Taba explosionwas a car bomb, and witnesses at the other two sites told relativesthat cars had exploded.(sg)
Three explosions shook three Egyptian Red Sea resorts popular withvacationing Israelis on Thursday night, killing at least 35 peopleand wounding about 100, according to officials from Egypt, Israel andnearby hospitals.Israeli officials said they believed the blasts were caused byterrorist bombs.In the largest explosion, early reports suggested that a truck bombmay have been driven into the Taba Hilton, a large concrete resorthotel in a little village just across the Israeli border and near theIsraeli resort town of Eilat. The Hilton was badly damaged by theblast and an ensuing fire, and 10 floors in part of the complexcollapsed. There were reports of people buried in the rubble.The two other explosions took place to the southwest, in the resortvillages of Ras al-Sultan and Nuweiba. At least seven people died atRas al-Sultan, most of them Egyptian workers, according to theEgyptian media. There was no other immediate information aboutcasualties.Last month, Israeli intelligence warned Israelis to keep out of theSinai desert, citing vague but solid information about possibleattacks.No definitive claims of responsibility were publicized, thoughtAgence France-Presse reported that someone claiming to be from apreviously unknown group, Jamaa Al-Islamiya Al-Alamiya, or WorldIslamist Group, had taken responsibility for the Hilton blast in atelephone call to its bureau in Jerusalem. The caller said the attackwas ""in revenge for the Palestinian and Arab martyrs dying inPalestine and Iraq,"" the agency reported.(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)Part of the Hilton apparently crumbled immediately after the blast.""I heard a huge explosion,"" said Yigal Vakni, an Israeli at theHilton who spoke to Israeli Army Radio. ""The wall near me collapsedand people began to run."" The blast was outside, he said. ""When wewent out we saw the shops and the internal wall of the hotel hadcollapsed."" Many people were lying on the ground, he said: ""There isa lot of blood, a lot of screaming.""An unidentified Israeli woman told Israeli television: ""Weimmediately ran toward the beach, everyone running at once, andwindows continue to shatter as we ran away. Entire families werewounded; they ran to the beach and were covered with blood.""(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)Panicked Israelis rushed the border post, trying to flee Egypt,yelling at the border guards in Arabic that their belongings anddocuments were still in the burning hotel. Guards fired shots intothe air to try to disperse them, before finally shutting the terminaltemporarily. Roads were blocked, leaving vacationing Israelis atother hotels trapped. Hadas Manor, an Israeli journalist staying atanother Taba hotel, told Israeli television: ""Most of the people herehaven't come with their cars, so they depend on Egyptian taxis thatare not operating now.""Television footage at the border showed an Arab Israeli woman beingcarried by her husband. As he put her down, she collapsed, and medicsrushed to her. Israeli television also showed scenes of ambulancesarriving at Eilat hospitals and unloading the injured, many of thembandaged and bloody. Others, apparently in shock, were wheeled in onstretchers.Israeli television interviewed a man who described the blast near Rasal-Sultan. ""We were sitting in a restaurant and suddenly heard a verypowerful blast,"" the man, identified only as Yaniv, said. ""Theelectricity went out and rocks were jolted by the blast. We then sawa second explosion not far from the first blast; it was a ball offire higher on the mountain. We immediately drove over to the siteand found wounded people on the ground. There were Israelis amongthem, they were bleeding in the sand and there was no one there tohelp them.""The warning about possible attacks came in an unusual public alertfrom Avi Dichter, the head of the Shin Bet intelligence service, notto go to Sinai resorts during the harvest festival season of Sukkot,when Israel shuts down. He said there was vague but solidintelligence about a possible attack against Israeli tourists inEgypt's Sinai, where as many as 12,000 Israelis were traveling forthe holidays, according to the Israeli Foreign Ministry. The holidaythis year began last week and ends Friday.Since his warning, Israel has moved in force into the Gaza Strip thatborders Egypt, trying to stop militant Palestinians like Hamas andIslamic Jihad from firing rockets into Israel. Hamas has vowedretaliation against Israel and Israelis for the assassination of twoof its leaders this year.But Israeli officials suggested that an attack of this magnitudewould have been planned carefully from within Egypt and was not tiedto the Gaza operation. Hamas, which has improving relations withCairo, may not want to embarrass Egypt in this way, said Oded Granot,a commentator on Arab affairs. He suggested that al-Qaida, anoffshoot or an Egyptian radical group might be responsible.In November 2002, attackers drove a car bomb into a resort hotelpopular with Israelis in Mombasa, Kenya, killing 12, and firedmissiles at an Israeli charter jet, which only narrowly missed theirtarget.Israeli officials speculated Thursday night that militants, findingit increasingly difficult to attack Israelis in Israel itself, arechoosing to attack them abroad. The militants may also be trying tocause further strains between Israel and Egypt, which are trying tocooperate on the Israeli government plan for a unilateral withdrawalfrom the Gaza Strip.Israel also regularly complains that Egypt should do more to stop thesmuggling of arms into Gaza and that Cairo does not take its securityresponsibilities seriously enough.The Egyptians say that Israel would best protect itself by makingserious progress toward peace with the Palestinians, rather than byaccelerating the cycle of violence. But Egypt will not want theIsraeli-Palestinian struggle to spill across the border and isexpected by Israeli officials to move quickly to try to track downthose responsible.The attacks may also be intended to damage Egypt's tourism industry,on which it depends heavily. In 1997, after radicals attackedtourists in Luxor and killed nearly 70 people, Egypt cracked downhard on Islamic Jihad.The Egyptian government at first suggested the Hilton explosion wascaused by gas canisters and initially prevented Israeli rescueworkers without passports from crossing the border to the hotel. TheIsraeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, spoke with the Egyptianpresident, Hosni Mubarak, and persuaded him to allow Israeli rescueworkers to the scene without delay.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)Yuval Steinitz, the chairman of parliament's foreign and defensecommittee, said: ""What is sad is the fact that over recent months wehave received incessant warnings concerning a possible attack inSinai, and these warnings grew more and more clear, but the publicfailed to listen.""Taba is a small village dominated by the Hilton, originally built bythe Israelis. Israel returned the Sinai to Egypt in 1982 but claimedthat Taba was inside Israel according to the international border.International arbitrators disagreed, and Israel returned Taba, alongwith the expensive hotel, to Egypt in March 1989. Israeli andPalestinian negotiators have met numerous times at the hotel forpeace talks.Eyewitnesses told similar stories. Hassan Elkhin told Israeli channel10: ""After the blast, parts of the wall and ceiling began to crumble.I ran to look for my friends and found them downstairs in the casino.I pulled them out and we managed to leave the hotel. The walls aroundus collapsed, and there was fire around."" Standing outside the hotel,he said, ""we watched as the rooms disappeared, they collapsed oneafter the other.""When asked if he wasn't afraid to travel to Sinai, Elkhin said: ""Iheard the alerts and warnings, but I never believed anything couldever happen there, because, after all, every one there is Israeli.""Still,"" he said, ""it happened.""
In the wake of three explosions that had killed at least 35 people inEgypt's Sinai Desert, Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom onFriday asked his Egyptian counterpart to help rescue Israeli wounded.Quickly after the blasts, Shalom asked for Egyptian permission toallow Israelis to pass through the border without checks and to flyrescue workers into the Sinai.He said Israel wants to send between 20 and 30 buses to the Sinai tobring home some 15,000 Israelis still staying there.After the explosions, the anti-terror unit in the Prime Minister'sOffice called on all Israelis to leave Sinai immediately, and returnto Israel, Israeli Army Radio reported.An explosion ripped through the Hilton Hotel in the Egyptian resorttown of Taba in the Sinai Desert on Thursday evening, close to theborder with Israel.Israeli Police said that at least 30 people had been killed in theblast, mostly Israeli tourists.

A car bomb and a suicide bomber set off twin blasts that tore througha resort hotel in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula where Israelis werevacationing at the end of a Jewish holiday Thursday night, killing atleast 30 people and wounding more than 160, officials said.Egypt said at least 30 people were killed _ including 12 Egyptians _but an Israeli official later said he could confirm only 14 or 15dead, including five or six Israelis. He said, however, that morewere buried under the rubble. Israel Radio reported at least 35people were killed.The explosion was followed by two smaller blasts at other touristsites in the Sinai that killed at least two Israelis. Egyptianhospital officials said four people were killed in those explosions.Two bombs exploded in quick succession at the Taba Hilton. A carladen with explosives drove into the lobby of the hotel anddetonated, while a suicide bomber blew up near the hotel swimmingpool, the Israeli official said on condition of anonymity.Egyptian officials were investigating the blasts, but could notconfirm witness reports that car bombs caused all three.The Taba blast collapsed a 10-story wing of the luxury Hilton hotelbuilt by Israel when it controlled Taba from 1967 to 1989. Israelisdescribed a chaotic scene as the explosion brought the top floors ofthe hotel crashing into the lobby.Meir Frajun said his three children were playing one floor below thelobby when the blast tore through the building. He went down butfound only two of them.""Everything was filled with smoke,"" Frajun told The Associated Pressafter crossing into the nearby Israeli resort of Eilat. ""We werehysterically looking for the child. In the end we found him sittingoutside with an Arab guest of the hotel.""Four hours after the blast, Israel's military took command of thescene, according to the army spokeswoman, Brig. Gen. Ruth Yaron, butthere were delays in sending Israeli forces and rescue workers acrossthe tense border.The explosions came a month after the Israeli government urgedcitizens not to visit Egypt, citing a ""concrete"" terror threat totourists in an area. The warning, issued Sept. 9 by thecounterterrorism center in Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's office,identified the Sinai Peninsula as the target of a potential attack.The initial blast, about 10 p.m., rocked the Hilton hotel in the Tabaresort, only yards from the Israeli border.""The whole front of the hotel has collapsed. There are dozens ofpeople on the floor, lots of blood,"" witness Yigal Vakni told ArmyRadio.Others were trapped in the debris, and the Israeli official saidrescuers expected to find at least 10 more bodies.Just before midnight, two smaller blasts struck the area of RasShitan, a camping area near the town of Nuweiba south of Taba,witnesses said.Amsalem Farrag, whose uncle and cousin own camps in Ras Shitan, saidboth told him that cars exploded outside their camps. The two blastswere only five seconds apart, he said. He said the camps were full ofvacationing Israelis.No established groups have claimed responsibility for the bombing,but two previously unknown groups each said they carried it out.Tawhid Islamic Brigades published a claim on a Web site that has beenused frequently for such claims from Saudi Arabia and Iraq. And JamaaAl-Islamiya Al-Alamiya, or World Islamist Group, called aninternational news agency in Jerusalem. Neither group offered detailof how it carried out the attack, as such claims usually do, andthere was no way to confirm their authenticity.Egyptian government spokesman Magdy Rady suggested the blasts wererelated to the Israeli military operation against the Palestinians inthe neighboring Gaza Strip, where 84 Palestinians have been killed inan Israeli offensive that began on Sept. 29 to stop militants fromfiring homemade rockets into Israel.""I think the explosions are very related to what is going on inGaza,"" Rady told AP. ""We condemn these attacks, which have harmedmany people.""""I think it is very probable that there is a link between these threeexplosions,"" he added. ""It is very unlikely they happened by chance.""The security adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, JibrilRajoub, told Al-Jazeera television that no Palestinian factions wereresponsible for the explosions.Egypt upgraded a security alert at the airports in Cairo and in thesouthern tourist cities of Luxor, Hurghada and Aswan. Police weresearching cars coming in and out of Luxor and Hurghada and there wasa heavy police presence around hotels.Yaron, the Israeli army spokeswoman, said Israeli Brig. Gen. Efi Idan""took command over the event in Taba"" four hours after the blast. Shesaid, however, ""We still have some trouble in sending over all of theforces and their equipment to Taba.""An Israeli foreign ministry spokeswoman said that Israel would helpevacuate any of the 12,000 to 15,000 Israelis who wish to leave theSinai. Friday morning, thousands were streaming into Eilat, acrossthe border.Israel set up temporary accomodations in community centers, andIsraeli radio reported a nationwide call for surgeons to get toEilat.Israel's Army Radio reported that initially, Egyptian policemen firedin the air at the Taba border crossing as dozens of Israelis tried tobreak through to get home. Reporters from the Israeli side wereunable to reach the scene, and no TV images were available severalhours after the blast.More than 100 rescue workers, many wearing hard hats, were laterallowed to cross, and graders were seen clearing rubble at the site.Egyptians reportedly allowed the teams in after Sharon instructed hisdiplomats to contact the Egyptians and expedite the crossing. The twocountries signed a peace treaty in 1979, but relations have beenchilly as a result of Israeli military actions in Palestinian areas.Rady said at least 30 people were killed and 160 injured in the Tabablast, and another seven Egyptians were injured in the Ras Shitanexplosions. Israel's rescue service said it evacuated 108 casualtiesto Israel, including one dead and 48 in serious condition.An official at Taba Hospital, who spoke on condition of anonymity,said his institution had taken in 25 bodies from the Taba explosionand two more from Ras Shitan. An official at the Nuweiba hospitalsaid two more bodies arrived there.Taba is the main crossing between Israel and Egypt and the gatewayfor thousands of Israelis who travel to the hotels and resorts on theRed Sea. Thursday was the last day of the weeklong Jewish festival ofSukkot, when thousands of Israelis vacation in the Sinai.Egyptians also were in the midst of a long holiday weekend markingthe anniversary of the start of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, so popularresort towns along the Sinai coast were packed.Egypt has long struggled with Islamic militants interested inoverthrowing the secular government, but has contained the threatwith periodic crackdowns and by allowing Islamists some politicalactivity.The last major militant strike in Egypt was the 1997 massacre of 58foreign tourists by Islamic extremists in the southern resort town ofLuxor.Rady said the explosions are sure to have a negative effect _ atleast temporarily _ on Egypt's tourism industry, one of the country'seconomic mainstays.""There will be damage definitely to the tourism in the area,"" hesaid, ""but I hope it will not last long.""___Associated Press correspondents Joe Federman in Eilat and MaggieMichael and Paul Garwood in Cairo contributed to this report.

A massive explosion tore off the front of a seasidehotel in the Egyptian resort of Taba late Thursday, killing at least30 people and injuring more than 100 in what appeared to be aterrorist attack aimed at Israeli tourists, officials said.The blast occurred at 10 p.m. at the Taba Hilton, a luxuryhigh-rise hotel on the Red Sea surrounded by palm trees and coralreefs, just a few hundred yards over the border from the southern tipof Israel. The hotel, a popular venue for Middle East peacenegotiators, was reportedly packed with Israeli tourists celebratingthe end of the Jewish holiday of Sukkot.News service accounts from the area said two more explosionssubsequently rocked the Red Sea resorts of Ras Shytan and Nuweiba,about 40 miles south of Taba, but details were sketchy. One witnessinterviewed by Israeli television reported that two rockets were firedat his hotel in Ras Shytan; another said there was a huge blast thatappeared to be from a car bomb. Egyptian hospital officials cited bythe Associated Press said four were killed in the two attacks.At the Hilton, witnesses described scenes of horror and pandemoniumwhen a huge blast occurred at the front of the hotel, catapultingbodies across the spacious lobby area, which has a large bar, a casinoand huge plate-glass windows looking out on a large salt-water poolnestled along the Red Sea. There were reports of large fires burninginside the hotel and people trapped under fallen debris. TheAssociated Press reported that an entire 10-floor wing collapsed.There were no official reports about the cause of the blast, butbased on accounts from the scene and the extent of the damage,suspicion immediately focused on a possible car bomb detonated at thefront of the building.``The whole front of the hotel has collapsed. There are dozens ofpeople on the floor, lots of blood,'' said Yigal Vakni, an Israelitourist interviewed by Israel's Army Radio. ``I am standing outsidethe hotel -- the whole thing is burning and they have nothing to put itout with.''``I was in my room on the fourth floor when suddenly I heard atremendous explosion,'' a tourist identified only as Shimon told theIsraeli Internet site Ynet. ``The explosion was in the entrance of thehotel, where the cars stop to drop off suitcases. All the glass fleweverywhere. I saw a lot of injured people, at least two dead peoplenext to the swimming pool.''Svetlana Ahmedallah, 33, said that she was in a room with hermother on the seventh floor when the blast occurred and that thebuilding seemed to collapse. The next thing she knew, Ahmedallah said,she was on the ground.``I was lying in bed and my mother was in the bathroom whensuddenly there was a strong explosion. Everything flew, and I heard mymother shouting for help,'' Ahmedallah said. She said she and hermother were in Taba on a two-week vacation from their home inTatarstan in Russia.Ahmedallah, interviewed at a hospital just across the border fromEgypt in Elat, where she was treated for minor injuries, said sheapparently flew through a window. She did not know what happened toher mother, but said she assumed her mother had died. ``I fell down tothe ground on the bed. The whole part of the building collapsed. Idon't know what happened.''Egyptian officials said they had no evidence of terrorism, theAssociated Press reported. Egyptian security officials, speaking oncondition of anonymity, said the explosion occurred among gas tanks inthe hotel kitchen, which is next to the casino, where many touristswere at the time.Egypt put the death toll at 30, and the Interior Ministry said 12Egyptians were among the dead. Israel Radio reported Friday that atleast 35 people were killed.After the explosion in Taba, many Israelis reportedly droppedeverything and fled about 300 yards north to the official Israel-Egyptborder crossing. Israeli officials said that after a period ofconfusion, Egyptian authorities began cooperating with Israeli fireand rescue personnel, allowing ambulances to cross the border toevacuate the wounded and search for those who remained trapped in thedebris.Moshe Moshiko, a fire department spokesman in Elat, said 30firefighters were allowed to cross into Egypt to help, but others wereturned away because they did not have their passports.``They are trying to put out the fire and save people who are stilltrapped in the ruins of the hotel,'' he told Israel's Channel 10television. ``The firefighters are climbing up through the hotel,floor by floor, to save the people inside.''Gideon Meir, a senior official in Israel's Foreign Ministry, saidthat in conversations with the Egyptian government, Israel hadrequested that Egypt permit free passage across the border for Israelicitizens and rescue personnel without passports, clearance for Israelihelicopters to fly to the scene of the attacks and permission for asmany as 30 buses to travel down the coast to pick up any Israelis whowanted to leave. The Egyptians responded that they would do ``theirutmost'' to help, he said.The Israel Defense Forces later took control of the scene at Taba.A military convoy including seven ambulances and three buses went tothe site in Nuweiba.Last month, before the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah, the ForeignMinistry issued a travel advisory warning Israeli tourists not totravel to the Sinai Peninsula because of possible terrorist attacks.But officials said they believed that between 12,000 and 15,000Israeli tourists were in the Sinai on Thursday.Israeli officials said they had no concrete information about whowas behind the strikes. But one senior government official noted thesimilarities between Thursday's attacks and previous attacks byal-Qaida. He cited in particular the multiple simultaneous strikes inother countries.``It looks like al-Qaida,'' he said. ``The characteristics of thisattack are the same as Bali, Kenya, or even Madrid.''No established groups have asserted responsibility for the bombing,but two previously unknown Islamic groups each said they carried itout. There was no way to confirm the authenticity of the claims.Elat is one of Israel's most popular resorts, located at the verysouthern tip of the country where Israel, Egypt and Jordan converge atthe end of a small finger of the Red Sea. Joseftal Hospital there wasinundated with wounded, said Naomi Halevy, a spokeswoman.``More people are coming in every minute,'' she said in a telephoneinterview. ``It's a total mess.'' Hospital officials reportedreceiving 112 injured.There were few reliable reports about the other blasts. Assaf Levy,a tourist who was staying at the Castle Beach Hotel in Ras Shytan,said he was relaxing with friends when suddenly a missile was firedfrom the long, high mountain range that runs along much of the coast.``There was fire, a huge explosion, and we all ran outside,'' hetold Israel's Channel 2. ``Two minutes later we saw another missilethat fell in the parking lot of the Castle Beach. Some people even rantowards the water and got into the sea because they were afraid of themissiles.''Aya Reich, 28, a lawyer from Tel Aviv, said she was dining withabout 10 friends at a small beach community called Moon Island when``suddenly there was a strong explosion about 30 meters away from us,and everyone flew, and then a minute later there was anotherexplosion, and we all started running towards the water.''``People were falling on top of each other,'' said Reich, who waswounded in the foot by shrapnel. ``Everyone was hysterical.''Special correspondent Samuel Sockol in Elat and researcher HillaryClaussen contributed to this report.
Egyptian and Israeli rescue workers picked through the ruins of aluxury Sinai hotel Friday after at least 27 people were killed inbomb attacks on Thursday night that shook the hotel and two otherspopular with vacationing Israelis.Israeli officials said they believed the blasts, in which more than100 were wounded, were caused by terrorist bombs.The workers from the two countries labored side by side at the ruinsof the the hotel, the Taba Hilton, using heavy earthmoving equipment,their bare hands, and rope to pull apart the rubble, and enlistingsniffer dogs in a retrieval effort or to search for any remainingvictims.The two other blasts took place to the southwest, in the resortvillages of Ras al-Sultan and Nuweiba.A coordinator of the Israeli rescue efforts, Col. Gidon Baron, saidthat the bodies of some of the 27 people he confirmed were killed hadbeen retrieved from the rubble of the hotel Friday. An Egyptiandoctor at the Taba hospital, Wael Nahran, said 22 bodies had beentaken to the hospital's morgue.A previously unknown pro-al Qaida Islamist group called IslamicTawhid Brigades claimed responsibility for the blast on a Web site, aReuters report said. The claim, along with one from another unknowngroup calling itself the World Islamist Group, could not be verified.Agence France-Presse reported that someone claiming to be from WorldIslamist Group had taken responsibility for the Hilton blast in atelephone call to its bureau in Jerusalem. The caller said the attackwas ""in revenge for the Palestinian and Arab martyrs dying inPalestine and Iraq,"" the agency reported.Israel's deputy defense minister, Zeev Boim, told reporters theattack appeared to be the work of ""international terror groups likeal-Qaida or branches of it,"" according to Reuters.The largest explosion was at the Taba Hilton, where early reportssuggested that a truck bomb was driven into the hotel, located in avillage just across the border and near the Israeli town of Eilat.Israel Radio said Friday morning that officials thought there wasalso a suicide bomber in the Hilton.The hotel was badly damaged by the blast and an ensuing fire, and 10floors in the complex collapsed.Part of the Hilton apparently crumbled immediately after the blast.""I heard a huge explosion,"" said Yigal Vakni, an Israeli at theHilton who spoke to Israeli Army Radio. ""The wall near me collapsedand people began to run.""The blast was outside, he said. ""When we went out we saw the shopsand the internal wall of the hotel had collapsed.""Many people were lying on the ground, he said, ""There is a lot ofblood, a lot of screaming."" An unnamed Israeli woman told Israelitelevision: ""We immediately ran toward the beach, everyone running atonce, and windows continue to shatter as we ran away. Entire familieswere wounded; they ran to the beach and were covered with blood.""An Israeli tourist, Gal Keshet, who said he took part in the rescueat Ras al-Sultan, said that one vehicle exploded after it breachedthe resort, while another car did not manage to get in but blew upanyway, without causing casualties.Last month, Israeli intelligence warned Israelis to keep out of theSinai desert, citing vague but solid information about possibleattacks.Panicked Israelis rushed the border post, trying to flee Egypt,yelling at the border guards in Arabic that their belongings anddocuments were still in the burning hotel. Guards fired shots intothe air to try to disperse them, before finally shutting the terminaltemporarily. Roads were blocked, leaving vacationing Israelis atother hotels trapped.Hadas Manor, an Israeli journalist staying at another Taba hotel,told Israeli television: ""Most of the people here haven't come withtheir cars, so they depend on Egyptian taxis that are not operatingnow.""Television broadcasts of the border showed an Arab Israeli womanbeing carried by her husband. As he put her down, she collapsed, andmedics rushed to her.Israeli television also showed scenes of ambulances arriving at Eilathospitals and unloading the wounded, many of them bandaged andbloody. Others, apparently in shock, were wheeled in on stretchers.Israeli television interviewed a man, identified as Yaniv, whodescribed the blast near Ras al-Sultan.""We were sitting in a restaurant and suddenly heard a very powerfulblast,"" the man said. ""The electricity went out and rocks were joltedby the blast,"" he added. ""We then saw a second explosion not far fromthe first blast; it was a ball of fire higher on the mountain. Weimmediately drove over to the site and found wounded people on theground, there were Israelis among them, they were bleeding in thesand and there was no one there to help them."" The warning aboutpossible attacks came in an unusual public alert from Avi Dichter,head of the Shin Bet intelligence service, not to go to Sinai resortsduring the harvest festival season of Sukkot, which began last week.He said there was intelligence about a possible attack againstIsraeli tourists in Egypt's Sinai, where as many as 12,000 Israeliswere traveling for the holidays, according to the Israeli ForeignMinistry. Since his warning, Israel has moved in force into the GazaStrip that borders Egypt, trying to stop militant Palestinians likeHamas and Islamic Jihad from firing rockets into Israel.But Israeli officials suggested that an attack of this magnitudewould have been planned carefully from within Egypt and was not tiedto the Gaza operation. Hamas, which has improving relations withCairo, may not want to embarrass Egypt in this way, said Oded Granot,an Israeli commentator on Arab affairs. He suggested that al-Qaida,an offshoot of the group or an Egyptian radical group might beresponsible. In November 2002, attackers drove a car bomb into ahotel popular with Israelis in Mombasa, Kenya, killing 13, and firedmissiles at an Israeli charter jet, but missed the target.Israeli officials speculated Thursday night that militants, findingit increasingly hard to attack Israelis in Israel, are choosing toattack them abroad. They may also be trying to cause strains betweenIsrael and Egypt, which are trying to cooperate on the Israeligovernment plan for a withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.Israel also regularly complains that Egypt should do more to stop thesmuggling of arms into Gaza and that Cairo does not take its securityresponsibilities seriously enough.The Egyptians say that Israel would best protect itself by makingserious progress toward peace with the Palestinians, rather than byaccelerating the cycle of violence. But Egypt will not want theIsraeli-Palestinian struggle to spill across the border and isexpected by Israeli officials to move quickly to try to track downthose responsible.The attacks may also be intended to damage Egypt's tourism industry,on which it depends heavily. In 1997, after militants attackedtourists in Luxor and killed nearly 70 people, Egypt cracked downhard on Islamic Jihad.The Egyptian government at first suggested the Hilton explosion wascaused by gas canisters and initially prevented Israeli rescueworkers without passports from crossing the border to the hotel. TheIsraeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, spoke with the Egyptianpresident, Hosni Mubarak, and persuaded him to allow Israeli rescueworkers to the scene without delay.Yuval Steinitz, chairman of Parliament's foreign and defensecommittee, said: ""What is sad is the fact that over recent months wehave received incessant warnings concerning a possible attack inSinai, and these warnings grew more and more clear, but the publicfailed to listen.""Taba is a small village dominated by the Hilton, originally built bythe Israelis. Israel returned the Sinai to Egypt in 1982 but claimedthat Taba was inside Israel according to the international border.International arbitrators disagreed, and Israel returned Taba, alongwith the expensive hotel, to Egypt in March 1989. Israeli andPalestinian negotiators have met numerous times at the hotel forpeace talks.Witnesses told similar stories of the attacks.Hassan Elkhin told Israeli Channel 10: ""After the blast, parts of thewall and ceiling began to crumble. I ran to look for my friends andfound them downstairs in the casino. I pulled them out and we managedto leave the hotel. The walls around us collapsed, and there was firearound."" Standing outside the hotel, he said, ""we watched as therooms disappeared, they collapsed one after the other.""When asked if he wasn't afraid to travel to Sinai, Elkhin said: ""Iheard the alerts and warnings, but I never believed anything couldever happen there, because, after all, every one there is Israeli.""Still,"" he said, ""it happened.""
At least 12 people were killed and 135 others injured in three blaststhat targeted tourist resorts in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, theInterior Ministry said in a statement early Friday.Most of the victims were Israelis.The explosions came one month after the Israeli government urgedcitizens not to visit Egypt, citing a terror threat to tourists inthe area.The warning, issued on Sept. 9 by the counter-terrorism center ofPrime Minister Ariel Sharon's office, identified Sinai as the targetof a potential attack.A huge car-bombing rocked the Hilton hotel in Egypt's Red Sea resortof Taba late Thursday. The explosion was followed by two smallerblasts at resort towns of Nuwaiba and Ras al-Sultan in Sinai, dozensof kilometers southwest of Taba.
","Israeli officials strongly suspect the al-Qaida network in the three Sinai Peninsula resort blasts based on similarities with past attacks. Another previously unknown group, Islamic Unity Brigades, claimed responsibility for the series of bombings, supposedly as revenge for Israel's assassination of Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin in March. Both a car bomb and a suicide bomber struck the Taba Hilton at about 10:00 p.m. Car bombs are suspected in the blasts which struck just before midnight at the Ras Shytan and Nuweiba resorts. Accounts of the dead and wounded varied throughout the rescue effort. ","After the explosion many Israelis immediately fled across the border. The Egyptians facilitated the evacuation. Egyptian authorities cooperated with Israeli fire and rescue personnel, allowing ambulances to cross the border to evacuate the wounded and search for those trapped in the debris. Two groups, one calling itself the Islamic Unity Brigade and a previously unknown pro-Al Qaeda Islamic group called Islamic Tawhid Brigades, claimed responsibility for the bombings. Neither group offered details of how it carried out the attack. Their claims could not be verified. Israel's deputy defense minister believed Al Qaeda terrorist network was involved. ","The massive explosion at Taba killed at least 30 and injured more than 100 in a terrorist attack aimed at Israeli tourists. Israel blamed al-Qaida but a group called ""Islamic Unity Brigades"" claimed responsibility. Israeli officials speculated that the militants were finding it difficult to attack Israelis in Israel and were choosing to attack them abroad. The attacks may also be intended to damage Egypt's tourism industry. Two blasts in quick succession had collapsed a ten story wing of the luxury Taba Hilton hotel. More than 100 rescue workers were allowed to enter the damaged area. ","On Sept. 9th Israel advised Israeli tourists to avoid the Sinai, citing a concrete threat. In early October al-Qaeda deputy Zawahiri called on Muslims to attack Israeli, Western and Asian interests everywhere, specifically Egypt. A second previously unknown group, ""Islamic Unity Brigades"", claimed credit. Possibly an Egyptian radical group was to blame. Israel blames al-Qaida, noting similarities with previous attacks, specifically multiple simultaneous strikes. The camp blasts were five seconds apart. One or more suicide bombers were involved in the Hilton attack. One car drove into the hotel lobby and detonated at 10pm. Another blew up nearby causing no casualties. "
D0915,D0915-A,"At least 30 people were killed in Iraq as insurgents intensified attacks on Iraqi and US targets, and election workers backed by troops started distributing ballot boxes for the vote in just two days' time.The latest attacks Thursday came as Iraqi exiles voting in Australia and New Zealand became the first to vote in their country's historic national elections early Friday.The exiles began casting votes as a British newspaper reported the United States and Britain have privately agreed on a way of withdrawing their troops from Iraq.Militants have promised an all-out onslaught against the election, but US President George W. Bush has urged Iraqis to brave death threats and seize what he termed an ""historic opportunity"" to vote in Iraq on Sunday.Supporters of Iraq's most wanted man, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, on Thursday posted a video on the Internet of their murder of a candidate in Iraq's elections from the party of US-backed interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi.The Al-Qaeda Group in the Land of Two Rivers announced Sunday on a website that it had executed Salem Jaafar al-Kanani, ""secretary of the traitor Iyad Allawi"", and a video would be released at a later time.Allawi's party has had 22 of its members killed in the space of two months, party official Imad Shbib told AFP on January 11, adding that as many as 44 had been murdered since the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime in April 2003.An Islamist group linked to Al-Qaeda warned it would attack Iraqis involved in the general election even after voting was over.""We have warned you not to go to the centres of this sordid comedy, called voting bureaus ... we renew our warning. They will be the targets of the mujahedeen (Islamist fighters),"" Ansar al-Sunna said in a website statement.Meanwhile, Iraqi exiles registered at three centres, in Sydney, Melbourne and the remote community of Shepparton in Victoria state on Friday and started casting their ballots.In London, The Guardian newspaper reported US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and his British counterpart Geoff Hoon have agreed on a so-called exit-strategy based on doubling the number of Iraqi police trainees and setting up Iraqi paramilitary units.The pair were acting on recommendations from retired US General Gary Luck, who was sent to Iraq by the Pentagon last month to look at the failings of Iraq's security force.New attacks across Iraq followed the deaths of 31 US military personnel in a helicopter crash in western Iraq on Wednesday.In one deadly attack Thursday, a car driven by a suicide bomber rammed an Iraqi army patrol in Samarra, a mainly Sunni Arab city north of Baghdad where US and Iraqi forces launched a massive operation last October to wrest control from insurgents before the vote.As security forces sealed off the sector to evacuate victims, a second car burst onto the scene from the direction of a nearby hospital. Eight soldiers and three civilians were killed, police said.In Baquba, north of the capital, a car bomb attack on a provincial government headquarters killed five people while the bodies of four executed Iraqi soldiers were found in the city of Ramadi.South of Baghdad, in the so-called triangle of death, a homemade bomb killed five Iraqis and wounded 15 on the road between Mahmudiyah and Latifiyah. A US marine was killed in the same area.With some 40 polling stations already destroyed by insurgent attack, even the distribution of ballot boxes for Iraq's estimated 14.1 million eligible voters underscored the tension hanging over the poll.In the Shiite holy city of Najaf south of the capital, police, US and Iraqi forces sealed off a one kilometre (0.6 mile) perimeter around a school being used as a polling station as ballot papers were taken in.Amid the relentless violence, the electoral commission pressed on with its mission in the closing hours of the campaign.Ballot boxes were distributed to 5,300-odd polling centres across the country, along with millions of ballot papers and tens of thousands of bottles of indelible ink which voters will be tagged with to avoid fraud.The total number of electoral staff is expected to swell to 200,000 on polling day.The US president said the vote offered an ""historic opportunity"" for Iraqis to start building a truly democratic society after decades of brutal dictatorship.""This is a historic opportunity for the people of Iraq to vote for a government,"" Bush said in an interview with Arabic televison station Al-Arabiya.The US military's top commander in Iraq, General George Casey, told AFP that the more Iraqi security forces come on line, the less visible America's 150,000 troops will be.In Washington, top Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy called for a withdrawl of at least 12,000 US troops after Sunday's poll with a goal of a complete pull out next year.Sunday's election has been marred not only by growing violence but also by a boycott by many Sunni politicians concerned that the election will cede power to the long-oppressed Shiite majority. However, a high turnout is expected among Shiites and Kurds ready to exercise their right to vote.Former US president Bill Clinton called Thursday on Iraq's Shiite majority to reach out to the nation's Sunni minority if they win this weekend's election.Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he also said he was ""totally against"" the notion of setting a timetable for the withdrawal of US troops.
Insurgents set off a car bomb and attacked polling stations and security forces in several Iraqi cities Friday, killing at least six people as Iraqi exiles across the globe began voting in their country's landmark election.Four people were killed in a suicide car bomb attack at a power station in the southern Baghdad neighbourhood of Dura, while an Iraqi soldier and a policeman were killed in separate attacks in Samarra and KirkukCampaigning by candidates for Sunday's election officially ended on Friday, as Iraqi expatraites in 14 countries -- from the Middle East to Australia to the United States -- began voting in a three-day process.""Yes, we did it!"" shouted Ali al-Kabeer, clapping his hands after casting his ballot in Dubai and breaking into tears as he hugged his wife who also voted.Kabeer, a commercial director, said he had ""been waiting for this moment for 54 years,"" 24 of which he has spent in England and the UAE. ""I'm doing this for my children ... it's the first step in a thousand-mile journey.""However, insurgents, including Al-Qaeda frontman Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, have vowed to wreck the country's first democratic vote in decades and there are fears the violence will pursue right through the election weekend and beyond.At least 60 people have been killed in a spate of attacks across the country over the past two days alone, in additon to the killing of 31 US military personnel in a helicopter crash in western Iraq on Wednesday.The Iraqi authorities have ordered tough security measures, including a curfew, sealing off the borders and the closure of Baghdad international airport from Saturday.US President George W.

We lost three comrades and one civilian was also killed in the blast,"" said the policeman.He was speaking from Baghdad's Yarmuk hospital, where medical sources at the emergency department confirmed the death toll and added that three others policemen and a civilian were also wounded in the attack.Campaigning by candidates for Sunday's election officially ended on Friday morning, as Iraqi exiles in 14 countries across the globe began voting.Insurgents, including Al-Qaeda frontman Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, have vowed to wreck the country's first democratic vote in decades.The Iraqi authorities have ordered tough security measures, including a curfew, sealing off the borders and the closure of Baghdad international airport from Saturday.But they have also warned that the insurgent violence will pursue right through the election weekend and beyond.An Iraqi policeman was killed and two civilians wounded in a host of attacks on buildings to be used as voting stations around Kirkuk, 250 kilometers (150 miles) north of the capital.The policeman was shot dead by attackers as he stood guard at one voting station in the east of the city, police told AFP.Kirkuk has a divided population of Kurds, Arabs, Turkmans and other smaller minorities and has seen mounting violence this week.A car bomb attack went off near a school to be used as a polling station in the same Baghad neighbourhood where the power station was targeted.A police officer said the blast had caused material damage but no casualties.An Iraqi soldier was killed and another wounded when their patrol vehicle went over a mine near Samarra, in the Sunni Triangle north of Baghdad, police said.Other attacks were reported in the triangle. One man was wounded in an attack on another polling station at Al-Dur and another civilian was injured in a mortar attack on a voting centre in Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown.Dozens of voting stations have been attacked by insurgents who have put up posters and handed out leaflets warning Iraqis not to vote.US soldiers also discovered three makeshift bombs in Baghdad Friday.
Five US soldiers and at least eight Iraqis were killed Friday in a string of attacks, two days before Iraq's landmark elections which insurgents have vowed to drench in blood.A US helicopter also crashed in the Baghdad area, two days after the crash of a transport helicopter left 31 US troops dead, inflicting on the US military its heaviest loss in a single incident since the March 2003 invasion.Lieutenant Colonel James Hutton said that three soldiers were killed and another wounded in the explosion of a makeshift bomb in a western district of Baghdad.Another two soldiers were killed and three wounded Friday in two separate incidents in the capital, bringing to 1,412 the total number of US servicemen who died in Iraqi since the invasion almost two years ago.An OH-58 Kiowa Warrior, a reconaissance chopper from the same Baghdad-based division, crashed in a southwestern district of the capital, but there was no word on the fate of the two-man crew.""At this time, we have no evidence of hostile fire playing a role in the helicopter going down,"" Colonel Keith Walker said in a statement.Earlier Friday, four people were killed in a suicide car bomb attack at a power station in the southern Baghdad neighbourhood of Dura, police and medical sources said.""At around 9:00 am (0600 GMT), a black GMC approached the checkpoint at the entrance of the power plant.

The group of Al-Qaeda's frontman in Iraq Abu Musab al-Zarqawi claimed responsibility Saturday for a suicide attack at an Iraqi polling station and vowed to spill more blood on election day, according to a statement posted on an Islamist website.""A lion from the martyrdom-seeking brigade of the Al-Qaeda Group of Jihad in the Land of Two Rivers carried out an attack against the Americans and their agents in the Khanaqin region,"" said the statement, whose authenticity could not be verified.""This is only (a small) part of what our virtuous sheikh Abu Musab al-Zarqawi promised,"" the statement said.""We warn for the last time that tomorrow will be a bloody day for the Jews, the Christians, their agents, and anyone who agrees to play the American-Allawi game,"" added the statement in a reference to Iraqi interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi.Iraqi police and the US military said that a suicide bomber wearing an explosives belt walked up to an Iraqi polling station in Khanaqin, a town near the border with Iran, and set off a blast that killed eight people, including a child and three soldiers.The attack was one of a series by insurgents in which at least 18 people were killed on the eve of Iraq's US-backed election despite massive security measures across the country.An official from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) in the Kurdish town of Suleimaniyah said the attacker had been identified as a Sudanese member of Zarqawi's network.""It was a Sudanese member of Al-Qaeda,"" Molla Bakhtiar, a member of the party's political bureau, told reporters.Zarqawi, a Jordanian-born fugitive with a 25-million-dollar US price on his head, has threatened to attack anyone involved in Sunday's polls.
Hours before Iraqis headed to the polls for amomentous vote, a rocket struck the U.S. Embassy compound Saturdayinside the heavily fortified Green Zone, killing two people andshattering the relative calm of election eve in the capital.The rocket attack marked a rare direct hit for insurgents, whofrequently target the sprawling embassy complex but have never beforekilled anyone inside. The stunning strike came despite a massivenationwide security clampdown, complete with Iraqi army tanks rumblingthrough the capital for the first time since the fall of SaddamHussein.Elsewhere in the country, several bombings and attacks on pollingplaces marred the day before elections. But the kind of large-scaleinsurgent offensive that some had feared did not materialize.Authorities expect the violence to worsen Sunday, when voters will beparticularly vulnerable as they venture to some of the more than 5,200polling places.``I think we'll see millions of people across Iraq vote tomorrow,''said Lt. Gen. Thomas F. Metz, operational chief for the more than150,000 coalition troops here.During his weekly radio address Saturday, President Bush hailedIraqi voters, who he said were ``standing firm'' despite threats. Hisremarks were aired shortly before the embassy was struck.``Tomorrow's elections will happen because of their courage anddetermination,'' Bush said. ``In the face of assassination, brutalviolence and calculated intimidation, Iraqis continue to prepare forthe elections and to campaign for their candidates.''Iraqis are scheduled to choose a 275-member transitional nationalassembly, 18 provincial councils and, in three northern provinces, aKurdish Parliament.U.S. and Iraqi security forces spent Saturday setting up cordonsaround polling stations in an effort to protect voters.``We are on the lookout,'' said Brig. Gen. Adil Molan Ghaidan,police chief in Diyala province northeast of Baghdad.More than 14 million Iraqis are eligible to vote, but turnout isunpredictable amid the violence that has swept across large swaths ofIraq and amid the deep fissures among the nation's three major groups-- Shiite Muslims, Sunni Muslims and ethnic Kurds.This tense capital, its streets devoid of most civilian traffic butbristling with edgy U.S. soldiers and Iraqi forces wearing black skimasks, was oddly quiet through most of Saturday. Anxious troops waryof suicide car bombers trained weapons on the few vehicles that wereon Baghdad's usually gridlocked streets, ordering many drivers to haltand submit to searches. At one major intersection, an Iraqi armedpersonnel carrier incongruously offered free rides to children.Security measures included restrictions on driving, a shutdown ofBaghdad's international airport and the closure of the country'sborders.Repeated reports circulated that insurgents had stolen policetrucks or ambulances and were planning to launch suicide attacks fromthose vehicles.A roadside bomb killed a U.S. soldier in western Baghdad,authorities reported.After nightfall, military trucks rolled through Baghdad's streetsshining high-power spotlights and warning residents on loudspeakers tostay indoors during the new curfew hours and heed the government's banon driving.Sporadic bursts of gunfire resounded through the darkened streets.The rocket attack that struck the embassy compound occurred shortlybefore 8 p.m., triggering a wail of sirens from the Green Zone, asealed-off swath of central Baghdad that is home to Western diplomats,contract workers, U.S. troops and others. The Iraqi IndependentElectoral Commission, which runs the elections, is also housed there.According to a U.S. statement, the rocket struck a buildingconnected to the embassy's annex in Saddam's former Republican Palace.The huge palace houses much of the embassy's office space.The Baghdad embassy, one of the largest U.S. missions in the world,is said to be home to some 3,000 employees, including a huge securitycontingent along with diplomats, representatives of assorted U.S.agencies and Iraqi staff.The facility sits behind two cordons of concrete blast walls and aseries of security barriers, checkpoints and body searches -- alltestament to its presence in one of the world's most hostileenvironments for U.S. personnel.The embassy, which opened last June after sovereignty was returnedto an Iraqi interim government, is the first U.S. mission here in morethan a decade.Many embassy workers are housed in nearby prefabricated trailersprotected by blast walls and sandbags; the trailers remain vulnerableto mortar and rocket attacks. It was not clear precisely where therocket hit.Outside the capital, a suicide attack earlier in the day in thesmall Kurdish town of Khanaqin, near the Iranian border, heightenedfears that insurgents may try to infiltrate polling stations withbombs or suicide belts. The bomber killed eight people near a policestation after detonating an explosives-laden vest. Six others wereinjured, according to a source at the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, aleading Kurdish political party.Despite the increased security presence, insurgents hit fivepolling centers around Baqubah, an ethnically divided regional capitalnortheast of Baghdad. Mortars struck two schools in the city, homemadebombs damaged two others, and gunmen sprayed a fifth with bullets androcket-propelled grenades.Scores of attacks have targeted polling places across Iraq inrecent days, officials said, but mostly the buildings have been emptyand casualties have been low.In and around the city of Kirkuk in the north, seven electioncenters were attacked with small-arms fire or mortars, according toLt. Col. Yadgar Mohammed, operations room director for the Iraqinational guard in Kirkuk.In southern Basra, U.S. and Iraqi troops sealed off borders withneighboring countries, padlocking gates leading to Iran, blockingroads to Kuwait and closing the Um Qasir sea port leading to thePersian Gulf.In Baghdad, hundreds of young men showed up near the ConventionCenter for $200-a-day jobs guarding polling stations.``I've been without a job ever since the war, so I signed up forthis job because it seems to be honorable and I'd like to a part ofit,'' said Abass Mihseen, 42, a former Iraqi Army officer. ``Maybeit's a new start for my career.''At a schoolhouse being used as a polling center in Baghdad's SadrCity neighborhood, election workers pushed aside metal desks and setup cardboard voting booths.``Everything is ready for tomorrow,'' said Dhia Fakhir, 38, managerof the voting center. ``Nobody resigned.''By late afternoon, Carlos Valenzuela, the top U.N. adviser to theelectoral commission, declared that matters were proceeding apace.``So far, things are going ahead of schedule,'' said a cautiousValenzuela, flanked by bodyguards in Baghdad's cavernous conventioncenter.But election preparations were not as smooth in other parts of thecountry, particularly in Iraq's Sunni Arab heartland to the north andwest of the capital.Sunnis have dominated Iraq for decades but have lost power to rivalShiite and Kurdish groups in the new order following the U.S.-ledtoppling of Saddam, himself a Sunni. Many Sunni clerics andpoliticians are vowing to boycott the vote, viewing it as another stepin their minority community's marginalization.Insurgents, believed to be mostly Sunni Arabs, have vowed to killanyone who votes.Mohammad Jobouri, head of the electoral commission in largely SunniSalahuddin province, predicted that only 10 percent of voters wouldturn out in Tikrit, Saddam's birthplace. It is possible that no onewill vote in the restive city of Samarra, he added.(Optional add end)``It's all because of the bad security, violence and terroristattacks recently,'' he said.Some Shiite clerics have preached that anyone who does not votetoday will face the wrath of God. The Shiite religious and politicalleadership views the elections as a means of gaining their long-deniedplace of power in Iraq, where they are in the majority. Kurds are alsoencouraging people to vote despite the threats.Throughout Iraq, people vowed not to be intimidated.``This is going to be a free and honest experiment,'' said AmirMoosa, 42, of Basra. ``We do not fear threats. Even bombs won't stopus. It is our destiny.''Times staff writers Alissa J. Rubin in Baghdad and Tom Hamburger inWashington and special correspondents in Samarra, Basra, Kirkuk andBaghdad contributed to this report.
Insurgents killed at least 19 Iraqis and bombed  polling stations on Thursday in a fierce campaign to wreck Sunday's general elections.With the election only three days away, violence has been escalating. The flurry of attacks, following a helicopter crash that killed 31 US troops on Wednesday, were concentrated on the heartland of Iraq' minority Sunnis.In the deadliest attack on Thursday, a car bomb hit an Iraqi army patrol near a polling station in Samarra, a mainly Sunni Muslim city. Seven Iraqis were killed and five others wounded, police said.In Baquba, 60 km northeast of the capital Baghdad, a suicide car bomb hit the headquarters of a provincial government, killing five people.South of Baghdad, in the so-called triangle of death, a homemade bomb killed five Iraqis and injured 15 on the road between Mahmudiyah and Latifiyah.Gunmen killed a policeman in an attack in Musayyib, south of Baghdad, and a roadside bomb killed a police officer in Baiji.One US Marine was killed in action and four others wounded while conducting security and stability operations in Babil Province, according to the US military.Three small bomb blasts occurred at polling stations in Iraq's southern city of Basra on Thursday, but no one was hurt, accordingto a British army spokesman.With about 40 polling stations destroyed by insurgents, even the distribution of ballot boxes for Iraq's 13 million eligible voters, about half of the country's population, underscored the grim security situation.In the Shiite holy city of Najaf, Iraqi police, US troops and Iraqi security forces sealed off an area within a one-kilometer perimeter around a school to be used as a polling station when ballot papers were brought in.Several guerrilla groups, including a faction led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, have declared war on the poll, vowing to kill anyone who votes.The militant group Army of Ansar al-Sunna issued a ""final warning,"" saying anyone who votes would be marked for death, either during or after the election.""Those who don't pay heed will have only themselves to blame,"" the group said in a statement on the Internet.The faction led by al-Qaida ally Abu Musab al-Zarqawi said Thursday on a website that it had executed a candidate of interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi's party and a video would be released later.In the past two months, 22 members of Allawi's party were killed, according to party official Imad Shbib.In the countdown to the election, the Iraqi security forces bore the brunt of the attacks. While US forces worked to quell theinsurgency, the US State Department has asserted that Iraqis will take ""paramount"" responsibility in providing security for the election.""I think you will see on Election Day that most of the securityis being provided by the Iraqis and the Iraqi forces,"" said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher.Boucher said US President George W. Bush was confident that theworld would recognize the legitimacy of the election despite worries that it would be marred by a boycott by Sunni Muslims and violence.US military commanders and Iraqi officials predict that violence will flare up as insurgents attempt spectacular new attacks.Meanwhile, US President Bush and interim Iraqi President Ghazi al-Yawar on Thursday discussed efforts to get Iraqis to vote despite growing violence. This was the seventh conversation that Bush has had with Iraqi leaders since the beginning of 2003.Despite Bush's confidence in the election, Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday that the election would not be fully democratic since one major ethnic group is to be absent.Russia, a major player in the arena of world politics, said on Thursday that it would not send observers to monitor the election due to the security situation there.
","By Thursday, January 27, just days before the Iraqi election, insurgents had destroyed some 40 polling stations. Thursday's attacks killed at least 19 and included a car bombing near Samarra and three blasts in Basra. Forty-five polling stations were attacked across Iraq on Friday. At least six were killed. Attacks occurred around Kirkuk, Baghdad, Al-Dur, Tikrit, and Shorgat. On Saturday, several polling stations were struck, but no large-scale insurgent offensive materialized. A suicide bomber of al-Zarqawi's al-Qaida network attacked a station in Khanaqin. Other attacks occurred in Baghdad, Ramadi, Kirkuk, Baiji, and Moqdadiya. At least 18 were killed on Saturday. ","Three days before Sunday's election, 40 polling stations were already destroyed. Most were empty and casualties were low. Polling station attacks escalated Thursday through Saturday but no large-scale offensive materialized. Violence was concentrated in the Sunni heartland. Polling stations were attacked with homemade bombs, car bombs, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades, and small arms fire. Two police guards were shot dead. The worst attacks were a car bomb in Samarra that hit a nearby Iraqi army patrol, killing seven; and a Zarqawi-connected suicide bomber who approached a Khanaqin polling station and set off a blast that killed eight, including three soldiers. ","In the days leading up to the January 30, 2005 elections in Iraq, more than 100 of the more than 5,000 polling places across the nation were attacked, with many of those destroyed. Although 400 Iraqi were reportedly killed in January as part of the anti-election campaign, casualties at the polling places were limited because many were empty. The attacks ranged from car-suicide bombers, to small bombs, mortars and bullets, to posters and pamphlets. The threats to the polling places came from guerilla and militant groups, to include Al-Qaeda and mujahedeen factions. They promised more violence on election day. ","Despite heavy security measures, scores of attacks targeted Iraqi polling places throughout the country in the days preceding the Sunday January 30 Iraqi elections, with some 40 polling stations destroyed. Casualties, including Iraqi policemen, soldiers, a child, and a woman, were low because most of the buildings were not occupied. The attacks struck polling places in Baghdad, Tikrit, Samarra, Basra, Kirkuk, Al-Dur, Baiji, Shorgat, and Moqdadiya. Violence is expected to escalate on Sunday and continue after the elections. Many Sunnis are expected to boycott the elections, but a high turnout is expected among Shiites and Kurds.

D0915,D0915-B,"A suicide bomber killed one person and wounded four others near a polling centre in Baghdad's upmarket Mansur district Sunday as Iraq's historic vote unfolded, the interior ministry said.The blast happened outside a voting station near the near the popular al-Saad restaurant in Mansur, in the western part of the capital, the ministry said.US commanders have warned of suicide attacks, car bombs and mortar and rocket fire on Iraq's first free election in half-a-century as insurgents try to wreck the milestone event.In the southern city of Basra, a mortar shell landed near a polling station but there were no reports of casualties.
Iraqis nervously came out to vote Sunday in their first multi-party elections in half a century, defying the threat of attacks by insurgents bent on sabotaging the vote.Shortly after polls opened, a suicide bomber struck in Baghdad, killing one person and injuring another four, despite massive security precautions across the country.A steady stream of people in Shiite Muslim and Kurdish areas took part in the first elections since the overthrow of former dictator Saddam Hussein almost two years ago. But there were immediate signs of Sunni Muslim strongholds rejecting the vote.Interim President Ghazi Al-Yawar was among the first to vote, casting his ballot in Baghdad just a few hours after a rocket attack on the US embassy in the capital that killed two Americans.""Thank God, Thank God. Blessed are the Iraqi elections. We greet all Iraqi people and urge them not to give up their rights, to vote for Iraq, elect Iraq and not to give up on Iraq,"" said Yawar.Sunni Muslim insurgents have vowed to wreak havoc on the vote to choose a 275-member national assembly which will wire a new post-Saddam constitution.A suicide bomber blew himself up near a polling centre in the Mansur district of western Baghdad, killing one person was killed and four wounded.Sporadic explosions and machine gun fire were heard across the centre of the capital in the early morning. A mortar was also fired near the US military base in the northern city of Kirkuk just before polling stations opened.In Shiite-dominated southern Iraq voters appeared to be turning out enthusiastically Taha Lufta waited outside a station at the Al Amaali school in the southern city of Basra when it opened at 7:00 am (0400 GMT).""I came here to be first and encourage the people to vote,"" he said. ""I'm an old man. I want to be a model for others."" Lufta said he had voted for the Shiite list the United Iraqi Alliance ""because it includes Islamists, and we want an Islamic constitution in Iraq.""The alliance has the key backing of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the spiritual leader of Iraqi Shiites and is expected to be the biggest single bloc in the new assembly.Long lines of people were also reported outside voting stations in Kurdish strongholds such as Arbil in the north of the country.But the head of the local council in the Sunni Muslim stronghold of Samarra said nobody would vote there because of safety fears.""Nobody will vote in Samarra because of the security situation,"" said Taha Hussein. An AFP correspondent said there were no election staff at polling stations and police could not be seen on the streets of the city where US forces battled insurgents in October.An American serviceman and civilian staff member were killed and five wounded in the embassy attack late Saturday thatst of the country and the authorities banned travel between provinces.On Saturday, the authorities extended for one month the state of emergency under which it can order curfews and other special measures.US President George W. Bush joined Iraqi leaders in appealing for the population to brave the insurgent threats to make the election a success.US President George W. Bush and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan both appealed for Iraqis to brave the violence and vote.Bush warned Saturday that ""terrorists"" were bent on wrecking the Iraqi election.""The terrorists and those who benefitted from the tyranny of Saddam Hussein know that free elections will expose the emptiness of their vision for Iraq,"" Bush said.Earlier Annan made a special plea to Iraqis saying: ""Please exercise your democratic rights on Sunday. Whatever your feelings about how the country reached this point, this election offers an opportunity to move away from violence and uncertainty toward peace and representative government.""But with world attention fixed on the turnout, the impact of the attacks added new uncertainty to the outcome.US military leaders have warned that despite the huge security clampdown more attacks, particularly by suicide bombers.Iraqi police guarded polling stations with the army forming a second ring and rapid reaction force units from the 150,000 US troops in Iraq playing a support role.The Iraqi election commission on Friday predicted a 57 percent national turnout. A poll by the Washington-based International Republican Institute said it would be 63.8 percent.Sunday was also the final day for Iraqi exiles, many of whom fled Saddam's rule, to take part in voting in 14 countries across the world.
A suicide bomber struck in an upmarket neighbourhood of Baghdad on Sunday and mortar attacks and gunfire erupted around the country as Iraqis went to the polls for their first free election in 50 years.One person was killed and four others wounded when a bomber blew himself up near a polling centre in Baghdad's upmarket Mansur district in the western part of the capital, the interior ministry said.Police and soldiers had stopped the bomber as he tried to enter the sealed-off cordon around the polling station when the attacker detonated his explosives belt, a US military officer said. US commanders have warned of suicide attacks, car bombs and mortar and rocket fire on Iraq's first election since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein almost two years ago as insurgents try to wreck the milestone event.Six explosions jolted the northern Iraqi city of Mosul although the general hospital had no immediate word on casualties. Heavy security was in place around polling stations in the city, riven by insurgent violence since November.Iraqi soldiers surrounded polling stations, and it was difficult for people to move around the city. At one polling centre in northern Mosul visited by AFP the station was deserted except for the workers inside.Arms fire also reverberated in the northern flashpoint city of Baquba, an AFP correspondent said, as the streets remained empty shortly after the opening of polls.It was not clear what was the cause of shooting in the city that has been the site of fierce clashes in the past between US forces and insurgents. One voting centre at the Al-Hussan bin-Ali school in central Baquba was empty as US armoured vehicles cruised the city.In the southern city of Basra, a mortar shell landed near a polling station but there were no reports of casualties.
A mortar struck a voting centre in Baghdad's Shiite slum of Sadr City Sunday, killing four voters and wounding seven others on Iraq's election day, police said.""A mortar struck a polling centre, killing four and wounding seven,"" said police lieutenant Mohamed Hamid.The attack hit a voting centre in the Shiite slum of 2.5 million people, where the country's long oppressed religious majority were exercising their right to vote for the first time since the downfall of Saddam Hussein's regime in 2003.
A female voter was killed and a woman and her child were wounded in a mortar attack on a polling station in the northern Iraqi town of Balad, police said, raising the election day death toll to six.
A female voter was killed and a second woman and her child were wounded in a mortar attack on a polling station in the northern Iraqi town of Balad, police said, raising the election day death toll to six.""One woman was killed, another female was wounded along with her child in a mortar attack on a voting centre in Balad at 8:45 am (0545 GMT),"" a police officer said.A second mortar attack also struck near another polling station in Balad, predominently Shiite town in the middle of the Sunni Muslim heartland.
A suicide car bomber hit a polling station in western Baghdad Sunday morning shortly after the beginning of the landmark elections, killing a policeman.Two Iraqi soldiers and two civilians were wounded in the attack outside Zahraa School, being used as a voting center, police said.
A bomb exploded at a polling station in central Basra shortly after voting began on Sunday, said reports from the southern Iraqi city.No reports on casualties were immediately available from the blast at a school which was turned into a polling station, a police spokesman was quoted as saying.
In a sharp contrast to the rest of Iraq, no citizens went to the only voting center in the battle-ravaged city of Fallujah on Sunday, a Xinhua correspondent said.""No one headed to the voting center till now, and most people here said they were afraid of US soldiers densely deployed in the city,"" he said.With loud speakers, US marines kept on calling on local people to go to the polling station, but the much alienated Fallujans apparently declined to do so.US and Iraqi forces stormed the city last November to clear it of insurgents, forcing some 200,000 citizens to take refuge in makeshift tents in nearby villages.On the eve of the election day, two more polling centers, in al-Risala and al-Shurta districts, were set up in an effort to leave an impression that no province will be marginalized in the elections.The vast Anbar province, where Fallujah is situated, has not seen any electoral advertisement. Insurgents have in the past days targeted polling centers instead.People believed that the interim government could not even open a voting center as it would be an easy target for armed groups widespread in the territory.Sunday's nationwide polls opened on Sunday morning, ushering in a new course of the oil-rich but violence-shattered country.The 275-seat National Assembly will be formed by proportional representation of votes with a one-year mandate. It will choose a transitional government and draft a permanent constitution put for a national referendum by Oct. 15.A new government and parliament will then be elected through another ballot by the end of this year under the guidance of the constitution.
A suicide car bombing and a seriesof blasts rocked Iraq's capital Baghdad and other major cities Sunday as voters began to cast ballots in the elections for a transitional parliament amid heavy security.A suicide car bomber hit a polling station in western Baghdad Sunday morning shortly after the voting began, killing a policemanand injuring four others, including two Iraqi soldiers and two civilians.The attack occurred at a checkpoint outside Zahraa School, being used as a voting center, police said.A string of explosions were heard in the center of the capital after the bombing. The nature of the blasts and whether they caused casualties were unknown.In Baghdad's Shiite slum of Sadr City, a mortar struck a votingcenter, killing four voters and wounding seven others, police said.In the southern city of Basra, a mortar shell landed near a polling station but there were no reports of casualties.A wave of blasts also jolted the religiously mixed city of Baqouba, about 50 km northeast of Baghdad, within the first two hours of the election. The blasts were believed to be mortar fire in different parts of the city.Baqouba has a mixed Sunni Arab, Shiite and Kurdish population and has been an insurgency hotspot.In another previous insurgent stronghold, Fallujah, the streetswere deserted except for US troops and Iraqi security forces. Fivepolling centers were open in the town, but so far no voters have turned up.The polls opened on a chilly, dark morning at 7 a.m. (0400 GMT)and were due to stay open until 5 p.m. (1400 GMT). An estimated 100,000 policemen and soldiers were deployed across the country and traffic restrictions were imposed in many cities to ensure a smooth process.Iraqis will elect a 275-seat National Assembly, which will in turn choose a transitional government and draft a permanent constitution to pave the way for a new government and a new parliament to be elected by the end of this year.Iraqi officials hope for a turnout of at least 50 percent to lend legitimacy to the results. But many Iraqis, intimidated by insurgent groups which vowed to turn the election into a bloodbath,may keep away from polling stations for fear of life.
","On Iraq's election day, voting center attacks claimed at least six lives. A series of blasts around Baghdad included a suicide bombing which killed one and wounded four. A mortar attack killed four and wounded seven in the Shiite slum of Sadr City. In Basra, a mortar exploded, but no casualties were reported. Balad suffered two mortar attacks. One voter was killed, and a child wounded. In sharp contrast, no one went to vote in Fallujah. Most people said they were afraid. In the past days, insurgents have targeted the polling centers in Anbar province, where Fallujah is situated. ","On Sunday, attacks on polling places began shortly after polls opened and took six lives. A suicide car bomber detonated an explosives belt in Baghdad?s upmarket Mansur district, killing a policeman and injuring four, including two Iraqi soldiers. A string of explosions and machine gun fire was heard in the center of the city after the bombing. In Sadr City a mortar killed four voters and wounded seven others. A mortar shell landed near a Basra polling place. A wave of blasts believed to be mortar fire jolted Baqouba. Two mortar attacks killed a voter and wounded two in Balad. ","Despite heavy security, Iraq's election day opened with a suicide car-bomber hitting a polling place in western Baghdad causing four casualties. A mortar hit a polling place in the Baghdad slum of Sadr City, causing 13 casualties. Two polling stations in Balad sustained mortar attacks, killing one and injuring two. In Basra, a blast hit a school that was serving as a polling station, with no casualties reported. Sporadic explosions and gun fire were reported in Baghdad, Mosul, and Baquba through the day. ","Six people died in the Sunday January 30 Iraqi elections, despite heavy Iraqi security around polling places. Many Iraqis defied the insurgents' threats of attacks in order to vote; however, there was little or no turn-out in Fallujah and Samarra because of the security situation. The most serious attacks were in Baghdad, where five people including a policeman were killed, along with the suicide bomber, and in Balad, where a woman was killed. There were also attacks in Basra and Mosul but no casualties were reported. "
D0916,D0916-A," The Christian Science Monitor on Monday named a US journalist kidnapped in Iraq as freelancer Jill Carroll, who was on assignment for the US-based paper when she was seized.Carroll was abducted in western Baghdad on Saturday, by kidnappers who killed her Iraqi interpreter, the paper said in a statement, calling for her release.The incident had previously been reported from Baghdad, but Carroll had not been identified.
 The Christian Science Monitor newspaper on Monday pleaded for the release of American reporter Jill Carroll, seized in Baghdad by abductors who gunned down her Iraqi translator.Carroll, 28, a freelancer filing for the Boston,Massachusetts-based paper, was abducted in western Baghdad on Saturday, apparently on the way to interview a prominent Sunni politician.""We are urgently seeking information about Ms. Carroll and are pursuing every avenue to secure her release,"" said Monitor editor Richard Bergenheim.""The Monitor joins Jill's colleagues -- Iraqi and foreign -- in the Baghdad press in calling for her immediate and safe release,"" the paper said in a statement which named Carroll for the first time.The incident was reported from Baghdad by AFP on Saturday, but the agency, in common with other foreign and US news outlets, did not identify Carroll in line with a Monitor request as efforts were launched to find her.Carroll had reported from the Middle East for Jordanian, Italian and other news organizations for the last three years, the paper said.""In recent months, the Monitor has tapped into her professionalism, energy, and fair reporting on the Iraqi scene,"" the Monitor statement said.""It was her drive to gather direct and accurate views from political leaders that took her into western Baghdad's Adil neighborhood on Saturday morning.""The paper quoted unidentified relatives of Carroll as pleading for her release and asking her captors to ""consider the work she has done to reveal the truth about the Iraq war.""In a dispatch for the American Journalism Review published last year, Carroll wrote that she moved to Jordan ahead of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 to get a feel for the story.""All I ever wanted to be was a foreign correspondent,"" she wrote.""So when I was laid off from my reporting assistant job at the Wall Street Journal in August 2002, it seemed the right time to try to make it happen.         ""There was bound to be plenty of parachute journalism once the war started, and I didn't want to be a part of that.""Officials in Baghdad and the Monitor said Carroll was seized as she was on her way to interview prominent Sunni Arab politician Adnan al-Dulaimi.The body of her interpreter, Allan Enwiyah, 32, was later found in the same neighborhood.An Iraqi defence ministry official said Enwiyah was able to tell soldiers that Carroll had been kidnapped before he died.Carroll's driver, quoted in a story posted on the Monitor's website on Monday, said gunmen jumped in front of her car screaming ""Stop! Stop! Stop!"" and others jumped in and surrounded Carroll and Enwiyah.""They didn't give me any time to even put the car in neutral,"" the driver, who requested anonymity, said.""It was very obvious this was by design. The whole operation took no more than a quarter of a minute. It was very highly organized. It was a setup, a perfect ambush.""A guard outside Dulaimi's office told AFP on Saturday he heard gunshots fired a short distance away and rushed to find the body of a slain man.Dulaimi however told AFP he had no appointment to meet a Western journalist.Several Westerners are currently being held hostage by insurgents in Iraq, including an American, a Briton and two Canadians who are members of a Christian peace group.Carroll is the 31st media worker to have been kidnapped in Iraq since the start of the war in 2003, according to watchdog group Reporters without Borders (Reporters sans Frontieres, or RSF).Five of the kidnap victims -- four Iraqis and Enzo Baldoni of Italy  -- were killed by their abductors. The others were released.RSF renewed its call for Carroll's release on Monday, and bemoaned the dangers faced by reporters in Baghdad.""Journalists working in Iraq have once again been caught in a deadly ambush,"" the group said in a statement.""The interpreters death confirms that the Iraqi press continues to be the chief victim of the infernal climate for the media in this country.""

 Iraqi and US investigators were hunting Tuesday for a US journalist kidnapped in Baghdad as a French hostage who escaped after five weeks of captivity in Iraq arrived back in France.Jill Carroll, 28, a freelance reporter working for the Christian Science Monitor, was seized by gunmen on Saturday after calling by the office of a prominent Sunni politician, the US newspaper confirmed on Monday.Her interpreter, Allan Enwiyah, 32, was shot dead and his body abandoned nearby by the kidnappers, while her driver got away.The incident was reported by AFP on Saturday, but the agency, in common with other foreign and US news outlets, did not identify Carroll in line with a Monitor request as efforts were launched to find her.""We are urgently seeking information about Ms Carroll and are pursuing every avenue to secure her release,"" said Monitor editor Richard Bergenheim.Carroll's driver, quoted in a story posted on the Monitor's website, said gunmen jumped in front of the car, pulled him from it, and drove off with their two captives all within 15 seconds.Several Westerners are currently being held hostage by insurgents in Iraq, including an American, a Briton and two Canadians who are members of a Christian peace group.Carroll was the 31st media worker to have been kidnapped in Iraq since the start of the war in 2003, according to watchdog group Reporters without Borders.Five of the kidnap victims -- four Iraqis and Enzo Baldoni of Italy -- were killed by their abductors. The others were released.Frenchman Bernard Planche, a 52-year-old engineer, managed to evade his captors on Saturday.He landed at late Monday at a military base in France where he was met by his daugher and niece, along with Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy.Blanche, who escaped from a farmhouse west of the capital, said he was ""delighted to return to civilisation and to French soil.""The hostage developments followed a twin suicide bombing against the Iraqi interior ministry that killed at least 28 policemen.The Iraqi branch of Al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for the attack in an Internet message, saying it was to avenge the ""torture"" of Sunni Muslims in interior ministry facilities.Abuse scandals came to the fore in November and December when US and Iraqi forces discovered two overcrowded interior ministry detention centres. Some inmates had reportedly been tortured.Meanwhile in Washington, the White House Monday denied that the US government has been negotiating with insurgents and Saddam Hussein loyalists in Iraq, but acknowledged that it was reaching out to those who until now have rejected the political process.""Part of our strategy, a critical element of our strategy, is to broaden participation in the political process,"" White House spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters. ""We have been reaching out to the rejectionists.""The spokesman was reacting to a New York Times report Saturday that said the United States has stepped up contact with some Iraqi insurgent groups in a bid to exploit tensions between home-grown rebels and foreign militant groups such as Al-Qaeda.Washington wants to encourage the Sunni Arab minority to join in a government of national unity in a bid to undermine Sunni support for insurgents and allow for the start of withdrawal of US-led coalition forces.In addition to the human cost of the war, with 2,209 US servicemen killed and over 16,000 wounded, the Iraq war will likely cost the United States anywhere between one and two trillion dollars, according to a new study co-authored by a Nobel Prize winning economist.The research made public Monday by Joseph Stiglitz of Columbia University, a 2001 Nobel Prize laureate and former chief economist at the World Bank, and economy professor Linda Bilmes of Harvard University, argued that current official assessments of the war cost fail to consider key expenses likely to dog the US budget for years to come.
 Sunni Arab Muslims protested Tuesday a raid by US forces on a Baghdad mosque reportedly linked to the kidnapping of a US reporter.About 700 people rallied in the gardens of the Umm al-Qura mosque in the west of the capital to denounce the raid carried out Saturday night by US and Iraqi forces.""This raid was conducted as a direct result of a tip by an Iraqi civilian that activities related to the kidnapping were being carried out inside the mosque,"" said Lieutenant-Colonel Barry Johnson, speaking of the abduction Saturday of Christian Science Monitor reporter Jill Carroll.Her interpreter, Allan Enwiyah, 32, was shot dead and his body abandoned nearby by the kidnappers, while her driver got away.""Both Iraqi and coalition Forces raided the mosque in the early morning hours in order to minimize the impact on worshippers and the surrounding neighborhood,"" the military spokesman said.Six people were detained for questioning, he added.The Sunni Committee of Muslim Scholars, which is based at the mosque, confirmed that one of its members, Yunis Aikali, and five mosque guards were arrested in the raid.In a statement, the committee also accused US soldiers of desecrating the mosque and carrying away files containing the names of members.""The attack on the Umm al-Qura mosque is an attack on Muslims and Islam,"" said banners held up by protesters at Tuesday's rally which followed morning prayers.""We call on the occupiers to withdraw from Iraq because they are the reason for every crime and the death of every innocent in Iraq,"" Harith al-Aubaidi, a member of the scholars' committee, said in his sermon at the prayer meeting.""There can be no stability as long as Iraq is occupied,"" he added.The UN special representative in Iraq, Ashraf Qazi, also deplored the raid.""This again underlines the importance of all parties respecting the sanctity of holy sites and places of worship,"" he said in a statement.Carroll, 28, a freelance reporter working for the Christian Science Monitor, was seized by gunmen on Saturday after calling by the office of a prominent Sunni politician in the neighbourhood.""We are urgently seeking information about Ms Carroll and are pursuing every avenue to secure her release,"" said Monitor editor Richard Bergenheim.Carroll's driver, quoted in a story posted on the Monitor's website, said gunmen jumped in front of the car, pulled him from it, and drove off with their two captives all within 15 seconds.Several Westerners are currently being held hostage by insurgents in Iraq, including an American, a Briton and two Canadians who are members of a Christian peace group.Carroll was the 31st media worker to have been kidnapped in Iraq since the start of the war in 2003, according to watchdog group Reporters without Borders.
 Angry Sunni Arabs protested Tuesday at a raid on a Baghdad mosque by US and Iraqi soldiers looking for a kidnapped US woman reporter, the latest victim in a series of abductions of Westerners in Iraq.The demonstration came as Iraqis celebrated the Muslim Eid Al-Adha holiday a day after a twin suicide bombing at the interior ministry, claimed by Al-Qaeda, that left at least 28 policemen dead.Waving banners and chanting anti-US slogans, about 700 people rallied in the gardens of the Umm al-Qura mosque in the west of the capital to denounce the Saturday night raid.""The attack on the Umm al-Qura mosque is an attack on Muslims and Islam,"" read one of the banners at the protest.The US military said the raid was linked to the hunt for kidnapped Jill Carroll, a freelance journalist working for the Christian Science Monitor.Lieutenant Colonel Barry Johnson, a US military spokesman, said the raid was ordered ""as a direct result of a tip by an Iraqi civilian that activities related to the kidnapping were being carried out inside the mosque.""The 28-year-old reporter was seized by gunmen on Saturday after calling by the office of a prominent Sunni politician in the neighbourhood.Her interpreter, Allan Enwiyah, 32, was shot dead and his body abandoned nearby, while her driver got away.""Both Iraqi and coalition forces raided the mosque in the early morning hours in order to minimize the impact on worshippers and the surrounding neighborhood,"" Johnson said.Six people were detained for questioning, he added.The Sunni Committee of Muslim Scholars which is based at the mosque, confirmed that one of its members, Yunis Aikali, and five mosque guards were arrested in the raid.In a statement, the committee also accused US soldiers of desecrating the mosque and carrying away files containing the names of members.""We call on the occupiers to withdraw from Iraq because they are the reason for every crime and the death of every innocent in Iraq,"" Harith al-Aubaidi, a member of the committee said in his sermon at the prayers ahead of the protest.Ashraf Qazi, the UN special representative in Iraq, also deplored the raid.""This again underlines the importance of all parties respecting the sanctity of holy sites and places of worship,"" he said in a statement.Iraqi security forces, meanwhile, were on alert in western Baghdad looking for hostages, security sources said.The US embassy said it had nothing new to report on Carroll.The Christian Science Monitor said it was urgently seeking information about its reporter after confirming her abduction on Monday.Carroll's driver, quoted in a story posted on the Monitor's website, said gunmen jumped in front of the car, pulled him from it, and drove off with their two captives all within 15 seconds.Several Westerners are currently being held hostage by insurgents in Iraq, including an American, a Briton and two Canadians who are members of a Christian peace group.Carroll was the 31st media worker to have been kidnapped in Iraq since the start of the war in 2003, according to watchdog group Reporters without Borders.Five of the journalist kidnap victims -- four Iraqis and Enzo Baldoni of Italy -- were killed by their abductors. The others were released.Frenchman Bernard Planche, a 52-year-old engineer, held hostage for over a month and who managed to evade his captors on Saturday, was debriefed Tuesday by the DGSE foreign intelligence agency at a base near the Loire Valley city of Orleans.In other developments, a Polish soldier was wounded and two rebels killed during a raid carried out by coalition forces near the town of Hamza, south of Baghdad, Poland's PAP news agency reported Tuesday.Coalition forces captured four suspects wanted over the killing of a Spanish officer in 2004.In Baghdad, two policemen were killed and two wounded in separate shooting incidents Tuesday, security officials said.In Spain itself, police arrested 20 people across the country, mostly Moroccans, suspected of recruiting radical Islamist volunteers to fight in Iraq, national radio said.In the United States, a new study co-authored by a Nobel Prize winning economist, claimed that -- in addition to the human cost of the war, with 2,209 US servicemen killed and over 16,000 wounded -- the Iraq campaign will likely cost the United States anywhere between one and two trillion dollars.

Muslim leaders and her pleading mother appealed Thursday for the release ofkidnapped American journalist Jill Carroll as Iraqi officials said six detainedIraqi women were due for release by the U.S. military, a condition set by thehostage-takers who are threatening to kill their captive.But the White House said no prisoner release appeared imminent and a major SunniArab clerical group said it could do little to help win Carroll's freedombecause it did not know who was holding her.The kidnappers of 28-year-old Carroll, identified as the previously unknown""Revenge Brigade,"" have given until Friday evening for all Iraqi femaledetainees to be freed or they would execute her. However, Iraqi kidnap groupsoften set such deadlines only to ignore them and continue holdingcaptives.New images showing Carroll surrounded by three armed and masked gunmen wereaired Thursday by the Arab TV station Al-Jazeera. The 20 seconds of silentfootage were from a tape of which excerpts were broadcast Tuesday with the72-hour deadline.Carroll's mother said the video images gave her hope that her daughter is alivebut also have ""shaken us about her fate.""""I, her father and her sister are appealing directly to her captors to releasethis young woman who has worked so hard to show the sufferings of Iraqis to theworld,"" Mary Beth Carroll told CNN's ""American Morning.""Iraq's deputy justice minister, Busho Ibrahim Ali, said six of the eight Iraqiwomen in custody are expected to be released next week, but he stressed that anyrelease would ""not be part of any swap with any kidnappers.""""I insisted that the Americans should bring (the women's) files and release themand they will be freed next week along with other detainees,"" Ali toldAssociated Press Television News. He did not elaborate on who the otherdetainees were, but said the recommendation to free the women was madeMonday.Speculation that the Iraqi women may soon be freed raised hopes for the releaseof Carroll, a freelance journalist who was working for the Christian ScienceMonitor when she was seized Jan. 7 in western Baghdad. Her translator waskilled.U.S. military officials repeatedly refused Thursday to confirm whether anyrelease was imminent. In Washington, White House press secretary Scott McClellansaid the Bush administration was working hard to secure Carroll's freedom butsaid no Iraqi detainees were expected to be released soon, citing informationfrom the U.S. Department of Defense.""Any time you have an American held hostage, wherever they are, they are apriority for the administration,"" McClellan said Thursday. ""And we want to seeher safe return. As I indicated yesterday, too, I don't think it's reallyhelpful to go beyond that at this point.""Carroll grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and received an journalism undergraduatedegree in 1999 from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. She worked as areporting assistant for The Wall Street Journal before moving to Jordan andlaunching her freelance career in 2002, learning Arabic on theway.Her newspaper's Washington bureau chief, David Cook, also urged the captors tocontact them to discuss her release. Cook would not say specifically if thenewspaper would pay ransom.""I think our policy would be that we would welcome contact from the captors,""Cook told NBC. ""Either the family or the Monitor would be eager to talk to thecaptors.""Calls for Carroll's freedom were also made by Muslim leaders in Iraq plus a teamof U.S.-based Islamic advocates traveling to the Middle East to seek herrelease.The Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations flew to the Jordaniancapital, Amman, on Thursday and was planning to hold a news conference Friday inBaghdad. The group said it hopes to reach Arab television audiences and persuadeCarroll's captors to release her.The Bloomfield Hills-based Islamic Shura Council of Michigan, which representsabout 20 Muslim groups in the state, told the Detroit Free Press that Carroll'skidnapping would not help the Iraqi cause.In Iraq, leaders of three prominent Sunni Muslim groups demanded Carroll'srelease. Iraq's insurgency draws the bulk of its support from Iraq's oncedominant Sunni Arab community, which fell from grace once its Sunni benefactor,Saddam, was toppled.""We condemn the abduction of journalists who are a means to convey the truth tothe people,"" said Muthana Harith al-Dhari, spokesman for the Association ofMuslim Scholars, which is believed to have ties to some Sunni insurgentgroups.However, al-Dhari, who is considered a hard-liner in the association, said therewas little that his group could do because it did not know who was holding her.French journalist and former hostage Florence Aubenas, who was released in Juneafter being held hostage in Iraq for 157 days, also called on Carroll'shostage-takers to release her.""She came to this country to do her job as a journalist and not anything else,""Aubenas told Al-Jazeera.Carroll's mother said her daughter even discussed with her family thepossibility of being kidnapped in Iraq, a country where more than 240 foreignershave been kidnapped and at least 39 killed since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion thattoppled Saddam Hussein.""Those things have been said. And she knows that we love her and support her,""Mary Beth Carroll said on CNN. ""She knows that we can be strong forher.""
JILL CARROLL'S BRAVERY TO A WORLD increasingly suffused with media, thekidnapping of Jill Carroll in Baghdad is a reminder ofthe dangers that journalists face in the most dangerous warzone on earth and of the importance of foreign correspondentsin explaining distant places to Americans. Iraqi gangs, which seizeforeigners because they are easy targets, harm their country byrestricting the flow of information to the rest of theworld.By all accounts Carroll, a freelance writer on assignment for TheChristian Science Monitor, has felt a deep sympathy for Iraqis.She was learning Arabic, liked the food, and moved aboutwith minimal protection. She was visiting a dangerous neighborhood inBaghdad on Jan. 7 to interview an Iraqi politician whenher translator was killed and she was kidnapped. Somebody withher sensibilities, willing to take risks, is just the kindof reporter that is needed to explain the turbulence inIraq to Americans.It is no surprise that the abduction has been denounced bymany Iraqis. Even some among the Sunni community, where oppositionto the US invasion is highest, have come out againstthe kidnapping. ""We condemn the abduction of journalists, who aremeans to conveying the truth to people,"" Muthana Harith al-Dhari,a spokesman for the Association of Muslim Scholars, said. Accurateinformation about Iraq is of vital importance to Americans asthey consider how long US troops should stay there. TheIraqi perspective is best obtained from reporters with a toein both cultures.Beginning with the US invasion in 2003, 60 journalists have beenkilled in Iraq, making it by far the most dangerousplace on earth to be a reporter. One of themwas Elizabeth Neuffer, foreign correspondent for the Globe, who diedin an auto accident in the early stages of theconflict.The danger has worsened as journalists have become targets by designinstead of happenstance. The Committee to Protect Journalists reports thatmost of the dead are Iraqi, doing their best tofind the news in a society riven with violence. Thelatest casualties reported on the committee website were Mohammed Haroon,a journalist once affiliated with the Saddam Hussein regime, andFiras Maadidi and Hind Ismail, reporters for a prodemocracy newspaper.These journalists, had they lived, would have provided information andshaped opinions that could have promoted peaceful change in Iraq.The men who abducted Carroll apparently have a different purpose -to sow fear among news people. Doing journalism in Iraqis a tough, exhausting, and dangerous craft. Not to doit, however, would leave communication about the struggle of itspeople to the gunmen and suicide bombers.
","On Jan. 18, 2005 the Iraqi justice ministry announced that six Iraqi female detainees are to be released soon. U.S. forces had earlier said they were holding a total of eight Iraqi women and on Jan. 19 stated that some may be released ""in accordance with the normal process,"" but both U.S. and Iraqi spokesmen denied reacting to the kidnappers' threats.

D0917,D0917-A,"In a historic gathering steeped in intrigue, cardinals from six continents onMonday open their first conclave of the new millennium to elect a pope who willinherit John Paul II's mantle and guide the world's 1.1 billion Roman Catholicsinto a new era.Representing 52 countries, the 115 crimson-robed ""princes"" of a church stung bypriest sex-abuse scandals and an exodus of the faithful were to celebrate amidmorning Mass at St. Peter's Basilica before sequestering themselves in theSistine Chapel at 4:30 p.m. (1430 GMT).There, seated atop a false floor hiding electronic jamming devices designed tothwart eavesdroppers, they were to take an oath of secrecy, hear a meditationfrom a senior cardinal and decide whether to take a first vote or wait untilTuesday.""The new pope has already been chosen by the Lord. We just have to pray tounderstand who he is,"" Florence Cardinal Ennio Antonelli, considered by some tobe a dark-horse candidate, told believers who gathered for Sunday Mass at histitular church in Rome.Thousands of pilgrims and tourists were expected to converge on St. Peter'sSquare to watch the chapel chimney for the white smoke that ultimately will tellthe world that the church's 265th pontiff has been elected. The famous stove inthe chapel also will bellow black smoke to signal any inconclusive round ofvoting.Although the conclave could last for days, a pope could be chosen as early asMonday afternoon if the red-capped prelates opt to begin casting ballots aftertheir solemn procession from the Vatican's Apostolic Palace to thechapel.If they decide to hold off a day, they will hold four rounds of voting _ two inthe morning, two in the afternoon _ on Tuesday and every day until a candidategets two-thirds support: 77 votes. If they remain deadlocked late in the secondweek of voting, they can vote to change the rules so a winner can be electedwith a simple majority: 58 votes.Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said smoke from burned ballot papersenhanced by special chemicals likely could be seen at around noon (1000 GMT) andaround 7 p.m. (1700 GMT) on each day of voting by the cardinal electors, all ofwhom are under age 80. At some point soon after the new pope is chosen, theVatican also will ring bells.On Sunday, the cardinals moved into the super-secure Domus Sanctae Marthae, aeuro26 million (US$20 million) hotel that John Paul had constructed insideVatican City so they could rest in comfort in private rooms between votingsessions. Swiss Guards, their gaily colored uniforms covered by dark rain gear,saluted the prelates as they were whisked to the residence inlimousines.The daily La Stampa said cardinals gearing up for a stressful stretch of dayshad packed CD players and headphones in their bags along with prayer books andsnacks to nibble on in their rooms.Conspicuously missing from their quarters were cell phones, newspapers, radios,TVs and Internet connections _ all banned in new rules laid down by John Paul IIto minimize the chances of news influencing their secret deliberations and toprevent leaks to the outside world. The Vatican's security squad swept thechapel for listening devices, and cooks, maids, elevator operators and driverswere sworn to secrecy, with excommunication the punishment for anyindiscretions.No conclave in the past century has lasted more than five days, and the electionthat made John Paul II pope in October 1978 took eight ballots over three days.He died April 2 at 84 after a pontificate that lasted more than 26 years,history's third-longest papacy.Cardinals faced a choice that boiled down to two options: an older, skilledadministrator who could serve as a ""transitional"" pope while the church absorbsJohn Paul's legacy, or a younger dynamic pastor and communicator _ perhaps fromLatin America or elsewhere in the developing world where the church is growing _who could build on the late pontiff's popularity over a quarter-century ofglobe-trotting.The prelates agreed after John Paul's funeral not to talk publicly about theprocess, but the world's news media have been rife with speculation centering onabout two dozen candidates considered ""papabile,"" Italian for pope material. Thename with the biggest buzz was Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, a powerful Vaticanofficial from Germany who was to recite an opening prayer in Latin that thevoters be guided ""in our hearts in love and in patience.""Among the issues sure to figure prominently in the conclave: containing thepriest sex-abuse scandals that have cost the church millions in settlements inthe United States; coping with a chronic shortage of priests and nuns in theWest; halting the stream of people leaving a church whose teachings they nolonger find relevant; and improving dialogue with the Islamicworld.Cardinal Salvatore Pappalardo, an Italian who at 86 is too old to vote, toldItalian state radio Sunday he was confident the conclave would be guided to theright man.""Providence sends a pope for every era,"" he said.
Cardinals from six continents made their solemn procession to the Sistine Chapelon Monday to convene the new millennium's first conclave _ a secret and sacredgathering to elect a pope who will guide the world's 1.1 billion Roman Catholicsinto a new era.Clad in crimson vestments and caps, the 115 voting ""princes"" of a church stungby priest sex-abuse scandals and an exodus of the faithful walked slowly fromthe Apostolic Palace to sequester themselves inside the chapel decorated withfrescoes by Michelangelo.They were to take an oath of secrecy and hear a meditation before decidingwhether to take their first vote or wait until Tuesday.Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger _ a powerful Vatican official from Germany who oftenhas been mentioned as a leading candidate for pope _ recited a prayer at thepalace before the cardinals chanted the Litany of the Saints as they made theshort walk to the chapel.The cardinals were led by altar servers carrying two long, lit white candles anda metal crucifix.
Text of the oath taken by the 115 cardinals voting in the conclave to elect anew pope. The dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, readthe following in Latin:""We, the cardinal electors present in this election of the Supreme Pontiffpromise, pledge and swear, as individuals and as a group, to observe faithfullyand scrupulously the prescriptions contained in the Apostolic Constitution ofthe Supreme Pontiff John Paul II, Universi Dominici Gregis, published on 22February 1996. We likewise promise, pledge and swear that whichever of us bydivine disposition is elected Roman Pontiff will commit himself faithfully tocarrying out the munus Petrinum of Pastor of the Universal Church and will notfail to affirm and defend strenuously the spiritual and temporal rights and theliberty of the Holy See. In a particular way, we promise and swear to observewith the greatest fidelity and with all persons, clerical or lay, secrecyregarding everything that in any way relates to the election of the RomanPontiff and regarding what occurs in the place of the election, directly orindirectly related to the results of the voting; we promise and swear not tobreak this secret in any way, either during or after the election of the newPontiff, unless explicit authorization is granted by the same Pontiff; and neverto lend support or favour to any interference, opposition or any other form ofintervention, whereby secular authorities of whatever order and degree or anygroup of people or individuals might wish to intervene in the election of theRoman Pontiff.""Each of the cardinal electors, according to the order of precedence, then tookthe oath:""And I, (NAME), do so promise, pledge and swear.""Placing his hand on the book of the Gospels, each cardinal added:""So help me God and these Holy Gospels which I touch with myhand.""
Tens of thousands of faithful had been standing on the cobblestones for hoursMonday, all eyes fixed on the narrow stovepipe jutting from the Sistine Chapel,when a curl of smoke whisped into the chilly evening air.A gasp of disbelief spread quickly through the crowd. ""Is it black?"" asked anAmerican priest. ""It's white!"" cried a Roman clerk. A Colombian priest grabbedtwo strangers in a bear hug, screaming, ""It's a pope!""But within seconds, jubilation gave way to resignation when the chimney beganbelching decidedly black smoke.Paz Angelica Casillas, a honeymooner from Mexico, stopped jumping up and downand released her new husband from an embrace.""I feel like crying,"" said Casillas, 25, from the town of Tepatitlan. ""We wantedso much for it to be white.""But the world's 1.1 billion Roman Catholics were to spend another night withoutan earthly leader. The black smoke signaled that no man had received two-thirdsof the vote from the 115 cardinals sequestered in the chapel. White smoke wouldhave meant the world had a new pope.Thousands of pilgrims began their stakeout in St. Peter's Square early Monday,and as the sun sank in the sky the square began to fill. By 8 p.m. (1800 GMT)there was a lopsided crowd of tens of thousands, grouped on the south side ofthe square from which the chimney is visible.Lines of television cameras were all pointed at the same angle. Pilgrims trainedtheir cell phone cameras at the chapel roof. Nuns sat in circles, praying andthumbing through rosaries.""This is history,"" said Hernan Aracena, 19, wrapped in a Venezuelan flag. ""Astime goes by, this will be one of those moments where you say, `I wasthere.'""Firefighter Lance Smaw dialed home to Mesa, Arizona, to tell his wife Colleenthat he was in place.""We're sitting in the square, waiting for the smoke to come from the chimney,""he reported. ""Words cannot describe this place.""Smaw, 35, flew into Rome with three friends Monday morning, leaving Colleen totake care of the kids. ""She's taking one for the team,"" he said.""It's just a part of history and a part of a new tomorrow, a new start,"" hesaid. ""Not many people have the chance to do something like this.""At the edge of the large column-lined square, people paused at a newsstandselling the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano, which on Monday featured afour-page spread with photos of each of the 115 voting cardinals _ one of whomalmost certainly will be the new pontiff. Although the conclave can elect anybaptized Catholic male as pope, that has rarely been done.Many of those in the square said they were praying for God to help the cardinalschoose their new leader.""Now what we are all hoping for is that the Lord illuminates the cardinals ...that the Lord through them makes the decision,"" said Rev. Luis Serrano, a28-year-old priest from Isla Margarita, Venezuela, who is studying theology inRome. ""It is a very strong burden, choosing the pope who will guide thechurch.""Sister Monica, a 27-year-old Carmelite nun from Ragusa, Italy, said she wasconfident they would make a wise choice.""I strongly believe that the Holy Spirit will be the 116th (elector), and themost important one,"" she said. ""It will be He who will decide itall.""Before the cardinals entered the Sistine Chapel and declared ""extra omnes"" _Latin for ""all out"" _ they held a final Mass, which was broadcast on four giantscreens in the square. Thousands of people turned out, many weeping as theyabsorbed the solemnity of the occasion.Rwandan nuns in blue habits, Filipino monks in gray robes and tourists inT-shirts mixed together, shaking hands and hugging in the sign of peace. Tearsstreamed down the faces of Leila Mota and Mariana Dias as they embracedtightly.""For the rest of my life, I'll keep this moment in my heart,"" said Dias, a27-year-old architect from Natal, Brazil. ""The emotion is so strong, the faithis so great.""Sobbing, she said she could feel John Paul's presence.""I've seen Masses here on television, but I never imagined when I got here I'dfeel him so close to me,"" she said.Many of the pilgrims said they would come to the square every day until acardinal cries from a Vatican balcony ""Habemus papam"" _ ""We have a pope"" _however long it takes.""This is the first conclave of the new millennium,"" said Sister Jolanta, a29-year-old Polish nun. ""This election involves not only the church, but all ofhumanity.""
Cardinals from around the globe began their secretconclave to elect a new pope Monday, filing into the Sistine Chapel ina solemn procession hours after the putative front-runner to succeedPope John Paul II, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, inveighed againstideological fashions and urged his fellow cardinals to hold fast tochurch doctrine.Wearing crimson robes and caps, the leaders of the Roman CatholicChurch swore collective and individual oaths of secrecy before takingtheir places to begin the conclave in the chapel beneath the renownedfrescoes of Michelangelo. As they entered the chapel, they filed pastthe Vatican's Swiss Guards in ceremonial uniforms.Led by Ratzinger, the cardinals pledged ``secrecy regardingeverything that in any way relates to the election of the RomanPontiff and regarding what occurs in the place of the election....''They swore ``not to break this secret in any way, either during orafter the election of the new Pontiff, unless explicit authorizationis granted by the same Pontiff,'' and they promised to resist anyintervention by ``secular authorities'' or anyone else in the electionof the pope.After the oath-taking, television camera operators who wererecording the scene live and all others were ordered out of thechapel, and its wooden doors were closed.Hours before the conclave, Ratzinger delivered a blunt sermon atSt. Peter's Basilica. His homily at the traditional Mass for theelection of a pope amounted to a campaign speech for orthodoxy,continuity with John Paul's papacy and staunch resistance to culturalpressure for change in the 1.1 billion-member Roman Catholic Church.The German cardinal, who turned 78 on Saturday, described thechurch as a ``little boat of Christian thought'' buffeted by waves ofMarxism, liberalism, libertinism, collectivism, radical individualism,atheism, agnosticism and syncretism. ``How many winds of doctrine havewe known?'' he asked. ``How many ideological currents, how manyfashions of thought?''``To have a clear faith according to the church's creed is oftenlabeled fundamentalism, while relativism -- letting ourselves becarried away by any wind of doctrine -- is made to appear the onlyattitude acceptable in today's times,'' he said. ``A dictatorship ofrelativism is established that recognizes nothing as definitive andthat leaves as the final standard only one's own ego and desires.''Italian newspapers, without naming any sources in the College ofCardinals, have speculated that Ratzinger will enter the conclaveMonday afternoon with about 50 votes. A total of 117 cardinals underage 80 are eligible to vote, but two are ill, bringing the expectednumber of electors to 115. Two-thirds, or 77 votes, are needed forelection in the early rounds of voting.``I thought it was Ratzinger saying, in effect, what you see iswhat you get,'' the Rev. Richard John Neuhaus, editor of the journalFirst Things, said of the German cardinal's homily. ``It was vintageRatzinger -- calm, deliberate, precise, incisive.''The cardinals in red robes and white miters formed a crescent infront of the altar, which rests atop the tomb of St. Peter and under ahuge bronze canopy, or baldachin.``Obviously they're all sitting there thinking, what would this manbe like as pope?'' Neuhaus said.The cardinal described by some as the most likely alternative toRatzinger in the initial voting is Carlo Maria Martini, also 78, theretired archbishop of Milan. If neither can reach the two-thirdsthreshold, the field could open to numerous possible candidates. Amongthe most frequently mentioned are Cardinals Dionigi Tettamanzi ofMilan, Angelo Scola of Venice, Camillo Ruini of Rome, Francis Arinzeof Nigeria, Ivan Dias of India, Christoph Schoenborn of Austria,Claudio Hummes of Brazil, Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina and OscarAndres Rodriguez Maradiaga of Honduras.The cardinals arrived by foot and by car Sunday at the DomusSanctae Marthae, the Vatican guesthouse where they will sleep and eatduring the conclave. All were dressed in their traditional red-trimmedblack cassocks, their waists wrapped in scarlet sashes and their headsbobbing beneath scarlet skullcaps.Already forbidden to speak to reporters, they were to take a vow ofcomplete secrecy upon entering the Sistine Chapel on Monday. There,under Michelangelo's depiction of a stern Christ delivering the LastJudgment, they will mark their ballots at long tables covered withgolden cloths.Most conclaves in the past century have lasted only three or fourdays. But if the cardinals remain deadlocked for more than 12 days,they can change the rules and elect the pontiff by a simple majority --an innovation introduced by John Paul that has never been triedbefore. The ballots are burned in an old stove, and when someone wins,a chemical will be added to turn the smoke white.On Sunday, some of the cardinals celebrated Mass at churches theyare nominally assigned to in Rome. None was tipping his hand. During asermon at the church of San Giovanni della Pigna, Arinze told thecongregation that the next pope ``should be a preacher'' and ``ashepherd who sacrifices himself for the people of God.''At the church of San Andrea delle Fratte, Cardinal Ennio Antonelli,the archbishop of Florence, said: ``The new pope has already beenchosen by the Lord. We just have to pray to understand who he is.''
Cardinals from around the globe began their secretconclave to elect a new pope Monday and later cast their firstballots, failing to reach agreement on a successor to Pope John PaulII.Shortly after 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. EDT), black smoke emergedfrom a metal chimney atop the tile roof of the Sistine Chapel -- thetraditional signal that the cardinals have voted but that no new popehas been elected. The smoke momentarily appeared white -- the sign thata pope has been chosen -- and a crowd in St. Peter's Square burst intoapplause. The smoke then turned unmistakably black, indicating that,as expected, more than one ballot would be needed before the conclavefinished its work.The first vote came more than two hours after the cardinals hadlocked themselves inside the Sistine Chapel following a solemnoath-taking in which they pledged to maintain the conclave'straditional secrecy. Earlier, the putative front-runner to succeedJohn Paul, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, inveighed against ideologicalfashions and urged his fellow cardinals to hold fast to churchdoctrine.PICK UP 4th graf: Wearing crimson robes xxx L.A.

When Pope John Paul II arrived at Opus Dei headquarters oneMarch day 11 years ago, even members of the conservative lay religiousmovement long accustomed to Vatican favor saw the visit as a singularmoment in the group's ascendancy within the Roman Catholic Church.The pope had come to pay his respects to Bishop Alvaro delPortillo, the prelate of Opus Dei, who had died that day.``He came over to pray before the body of Don Alvaro, which is avery unusual thing to have a pope come over to your house to pray,''said the Rev. John Wauck, a professor at the Pontifical University ofthe Holy Cross, an Opus Dei institution in Rome.Now with its papal benefactor gone, Opus Dei's influence under thenext pope -- and its role in choosing the new pontiff -- have becomehot topics in a city awash in speculation as the world's cardinalsmeet behind the closed doors of the Sistine Chapel to elect JohnPaul's successor.Opus Dei, or ``Work of God,'' was founded in Spain in 1928. It isbased on the idea that Catholics, male and female, can live asanctified life without being priests or nuns. Many of its 85,000worldwide members work in legal, medical, financial and mediaprofessions and profess unquestioned fidelity to the church'steachings and loyalty to the pope. But critics have called the groupelitist, and it is depicted as a villainous secret society in DanBrown's best-selling novel, ``The Da Vinci Code.''Officially, Opus Dei has stressed that it is above the fray. Itsprelate, Bishop Javier Echevarria, has called for prayer, notpoliticking. He has pledged the group's loyalty to whomever thecardinals elect.``We already love with our whole soul the successor of John PaulII, whoever he may be,'' Echevarria wrote to the organization'smembers. ``Let us renew our desire to serve the pope, for it was onlyto serve the church that God wanted Opus Dei.''Others note that, for the first time, two of the 115 votingcardinals -- Julian Herranz of Spain and Juan Luis Cipriani Thorne ofLima, Peru, -- are members of Opus Dei, giving the group the abilityto work inside the conclave.``They have a chance to lobby the other cardinals from an insideposition,'' said an official with a lay organization with close tiesto the Vatican. ``Opus Dei has international connections, they knowmany cardinals, are appreciated by some. They are entitled to talk tocardinals, to invite them to dinner, all with authority.''Several European cardinals are known to be sympathetic to Opus Dei,among them Cardinal Camillo Ruini, the Italian prelate who runs theDiocese of Rome on behalf of the pope, and a contender to succeed JohnPaul. It was Ruini who last year opened proceedings to declare OpusDei's del Portillo a saint.But recently, several Italian newspapers breathlessly reported thatthe two Opus Dei cardinals were throwing their support behind thecandidacy of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, a German-born traditionalistwho has served as chief enforcer of church doctrine for two decades.Opus Dei flourished during John Paul's pontificate. In 1982, hetook the unprecedented step of making Opus Dei a personal prelature ofthe church, answerable not to local bishops in the dioceses where itoperated, but to the pope alone through the Sacred Congregation ofBishops at the Holy See.In another sign of the group's influence, the pope placed OpusDei's founder, the Spanish priest Josemaria Escriva de Balaguer on thefast track to sainthood in 1992, leapfrogging over Pope John XXIII. In2002, Escriva was canonized before a crowd of 300,000 in St. Peter'sSquare, becoming Saint Josemaria a mere 27 years after he died.The Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit and associate editor of hisreligious order's magazine, America, said it was undeniable that OpusDei had a stake in the election of the new pope.``They would not have grown so quickly and have gained theinfluence they have were it not for John Paul,'' he said. ``Given thatthey're ... responsible only to the pope, that is a sword that cutsboth ways. If you have a pope who is favorable to you, that'sterrific. If you have a pope who does not see things the way Opus Deidoes, that's more problematic.''Opus Dei officials have greeted the speculation about its role inchoosing a new pope with a mixture of political realism and amusement.``Opus Dei has no candidate,'' Wauck said. He said he thought theinterest was due in no small part to ``The Da Vinci Code,'' whosedepiction of Opus Dei is disputed by the group as inaccurate andmisleading.In an interview before the pope's death, Herranz, one of the OpusDei cardinals, was asked whether an Opus Dei member could become pope,given that its reputation is negative in some quarters. Herranz saidthe organization had been subjected to negative publicity, but thatsuch attacks were attacks on Christianity as a whole, not just OpusDei.``Opus Dei has become a victim of Christian-phobia,'' Herranz said.But, he said, ``more people today love Opus Dei than don't. And wehave a saint now, our founder Escriva, so more people understand thegood works and spiritual doctrine of Opus Dei.''Critics of Opus Dei have said the church's decision to make Escrivaa saint was disturbing in view of his friendship with Spain's latefascist dictator, Francisco Franco. Opus Dei spokesman Brian Finnertysaid that, during those decades, Opus Dei included both backers andopponents of Franco.Escriva hewed to the theologically conservative stances shared byJohn Paul, including strict adherence to the church's teaching onsexual and moral issues. He also spoke out against ``godless''communism.As for the future, Opus Dei officials say they are not worried.Their status in the church as a personal prelature is cast in canonlaw and is not subject to a particular pope's goodwill. To alter OpusDei's status, a new pope would have to change the canon law, and noteven liberals in the church expect that to happen.``From the pope's vantage point, what's not to like?'' Martin, theJesuit priest, asked. ``First, you have all these dedicated layCatholics. Secondly, you have Opus Dei's affluent members donatingmoney to the Vatican. And you have Opus Dei members adhering to themagisterium (official church teachings) as strictly as possible.''
Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church convene in theSistine Chapel this afternoon for a session that could producethe first ballot for a successor to Pope John PaulII, although such swift resolution seems unlikely.The last conclave in 1978 took eight ballots over three daysto choose John Paul. And the cardinals have much toponder after the third-longest papacy in history.This conclave feels the full weight of the church's modern challenges,including the influence of Islam, competition from evangelical Christians, thefallout from priest sex scandals, the roles of women andthe need to reconcile Vatican teachings that ban condom usewith worries about AIDS. The cardinals also must seek aglobal pastor with enough charisma to flourish in an image-drivenage.For the first time, credible papal contenders come from at leastthree distinct regions: Europe, Africa and Latin America.On a cold, rainy Sunday afternoon, the red-robed princes of thechurch made their way into the Vatican compound where theywill stay until they elect a new pope. Some drovethemselves; others were chauffeured.A Mass at 10 a.m. today will be their last officialpublic appearance until they have a new leader.The cardinals drew lots last week for rooms in the $20million ""Domus Sanctae Marthae"" (St. Martha's House), a hotel builtby John Paul II and operated by the Daughters ofCharity of St. Vincent DePaul. From there, they will goto the Sistine Chapel twice daily -- unless the firstballot provides a two-thirds majority for a candidate.For the first time ever, cardinals will be allowed to moveabout Vatican City freely once the voting starts, though theyare forbidden to talk to anyone who hasn't been swornto secrecy. The penalty is severe -- excommunication.According to rules put in place by John Paul II in1996, the 115 cardinals eligible to vote may have oneballot on the first day of the conclave, as thesequestered gatherings are known.Cardinals traditionally have used their first vote to honor mentors andadmired leaders, according to John Allen, author of ""Conclave,"" abook about the process of electing a pope.The elaborately detailed rules for election of a supreme pontiff forthe 1.1- billion member church are based on rituals goingback centuries.""Behind every single word in the constitution for election of apope, you'll find historical reasons we do it that way,""said Charles Burns, retired Vatican archivist.On Saturday, Vatican officials allowed a pool of reporters to enterthe Sistine Chapel, now set up for the election.Cardinals will sit in plain wooden chairs at six long tablesin a room decorated with some of the world's mostfamous artwork including Michelangelo's ceiling. The ""scrutineers,"" three randomly selectedcardinals who will count the votes, face Michelangelo's monumental ""LastJudgment.""For the next few days, the world's attention will be focusedon the chapel roof, watching for the white smoke thatindicates a successful election. This year, bells also will ringwhen a pope is elected.Black smoke from burning ballots with wet straw will appear onceeach morning and afternoon if no one is selected.If no cardinal wins a two-thirds majority, 77 votes, after thethird day, the cardinals will pause for a day forprayer and discussion, as John Paul ordered. Voting resumes forseven ballots, followed by another pause; then seven more andanother pause; then seven more. If there is still nopope, John Paul said, the cardinals may resort to asimple majority, or 58. Such a turn would come aroundMay 1.If the conclaves of the last century are any guide, apope should be elected by the end of the week.The longest conclave took 14 ballots, lasted five days andproduced Pope Pius XI in 1922.The shortest -- a day -- elected Pius XII in 1939(three ballots) and John Paul I in 1978 (three orfour ballots).The idea of a conclave, which literally means ""with key,"" wasstarted by church people as a means of inconveniencing thecardinals to make them speed up the process. Today italso provides a means of preserving secrecy in an ageof new technology.John Paul II's 1996 rules require that two ""trustworthy technicians"" makesure that no audiovisual equipment is installed.Cardinals are prohibited from written correspondence or telephone conversations with anyonebesides one another and workers who have taken an oathof secrecy. They also are forbidden from watching television, listeningto radio or reading newspapers and magazines.The cardinals have been under a self-imposed ban on interviews withthe news media, but Italian newspapers have regularly reported howpossible papal candidates are faring, what factions are forming andeven, from the Turin newspaper ""La Stampa,"" what the cardinalswere packing in their suitcases. (Some packed CDs and earphones,others put in snacks, according to the report.)Speculation continues to focus on German Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger who, asdean of the college of cardinals, will lead today's Mass.But at least a dozen other names are regularly mentioned.Ratzinger, a respected theologian known as a polarizing church figure whilehead of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of theFaith, is 78.Cardinals could select him as a ""caretaker pope"" who would presumablyserve a shorter reign than the 26 years John Paulserved.Other presumed front-runners include a slew of Italian cardinals, including DionigiTettamanzi, Angelo Sodano and Carlo Martini; Latin Americans Jorge MarioBergoglio of Argentina, Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga of Honduras and ClaudioHummes of Brazil; a Nigerian, Francis Arinze; and an Indian,Ivan Dias.Yet papal elections have been famously unpredictable, with unexpected winners andpresumed front-runners often facing surprising fates. Indeed, John Paul IIwas a surprise choice to many when he was electedin 1978.He was the first non-Italian pope in 455 years, and manyanalysts say the Italians are desperate to reclaim the papacy.Italy has the biggest national group, but the bloc of 20cardinals is not big enough for them to pick apope on their own.Latin America has 20 voting cardinals -- and nearly half thechurch's followers. Some analysts believe that to recognize the importanceof its Latin American flock, the church will need toname the first pope from the other side of theAtlantic.Gayle White writes for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

VATICAN CITY - On the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica,where the next pope will be introduced to the world,a red curtain now hangs open, as if waiting fora cardinal to arrive and pronounce the news in Latin:""Habemus Papam.""Tourists and journalists Sunday trained their eyes and their cameras onthe T-shaped chimney above the Sistine Chapel, where, sooner orlater, white smoke will signal the election of a pope.And the 115 cardinal-electors - those under age 80 - Sundayleft apartments and hotels and seminaries around Rome and movedinto the Domus Sanctae Marthae, the $20 million residence wherethey will stay while participating in the conclave that beginsMonday.The cardinals, who stopped granting on-the-record interviews more than a weekago, have offered few indications as to whom they willchoose to replace John Paul II, who died April 2after a 26-year papacy.Representing 52 countries, the most diverse group in history, the cardinalssay they believe the choice will be informed by theHoly Spirit. They plan to gather at 10 a.m. (4a.m. EDT) Monday in St. Peter's Basilica for a ""Massfor the election of the Supreme Pontiff.""Then, at 4:30 p.m. (10:30 a.m. EDT), the cardinals are scheduledto gather in the Vatican palace and process into theSistine Chapel, where they are to swear an oath, pledgingsecrecy, and to hear a meditation delivered by a retiredcardinal, Tomas Spidlik.And then, the election begins. The cardinals will choose whether ornot to cast a first ballot Monday afternoon; after Monday,they are scheduled to vote twice each morning and twiceeach afternoon until they elect a pope.Many Vatican watchers believe there is no cardinal who currently enjoysthe support of 77 cardinals, the two-thirds' majority traditionally requiredfor the election of a pope. But attention in VaticanCity is focused on one cardinal who is sure toinfluence the selection, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger of Germany, as wellas about two dozen others who are considered ""papabile,"" orqualified to become the 265th leader of the Catholic Church,which has 1 billion members.""This is a hard decision and a very heavy decision,"" saidSister Mary Ann Walsh, a spokeswoman for the US Conferenceof Catholic Bishops. ""They have to make the choice basedon the needs of the church and the needs ofthe wider society.""Ratzinger and several Italian cardinals are among the potential kingmakers atthe conclave, viewed by many analysts as able to influencethe selection of the next pope, even if they themselvesare not likely to be elected. Among them are CardinalCarlo Maria Martini, the former archbishop of Milan, who ishighly regarded by moderates but is considered unlikely to becomepope because he is 78 and has Parkinson's disease, andCardinal Camillo Ruini, the vicar general for Rome and thelongtime president of the Italian bishops' conference.Several Italian cardinals are also among the most discussed candidates forthe papacy. Cardinal Dionigi Tettamanzi of Milan has emerged asa favorite of moderates, despite his ties to the conservativegroup Opus Dei, because of his interest in social justice,while Cardinal Angelo Scola of Venice, the son of atruck driver who became an accomplished theologian, is liked byconservatives.But many Vatican watchers are focused on the possibility of aLatin American pope, because about half of the world's Catholicslive in that region. Cardinal Claudio Hummes of Sao Paolodemonstrated his concern for labor by offering shelter to strikingmetalworkers; Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires is a Jesuitpriest who prefers to travel by bus and refused tolive in the local archbishop's mansion; and Cardinal Oscar AndresRodriguez Maradiaga of Tegucigalpa, Honduras, is an advocate for thepoor who drew critical attention when he blasted US newspapers,including The Boston Globe, for their coverage of the clergysexual-abuse crisis. He called the coverage ""a persecution of thechurch"" and said it was characterized by ""a fury whichreminds me of the times of Diocletian and Nero and,more recently, Stalin and Hitler.""Among the long-shot possibilities are Cardinal Ivan Dias of Bombay, alongtime Vatican diplomat; Cardinal Marc Ouellet of Quebec, a crusaderagainst same-sex marriage in Canada; and Cardinal Ennio Antonelli, thearchbishop of Florence, who Sunday said in a homily: ""Thenew pope has already been chosen by the Lord. Wejust have to pray to understand who he is.""Ratzinger, who was the prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrineof the Faith during the John Paul II papacy, isadmired by many for his defense of orthodoxy, but isalso controversial for approving the disciplining of numerous theologians. Ratzingerrecently approved a teaching ban against the Rev. Roger Haight,formerly of the Weston Jesuit School of Theology in Cambridge,because Ratzinger deemed a book Haight wrote as containing ""seriousdoctrinal errors"" about the role of Jesus in the salvationfor non-Christians.Ratzinger has enjoyed a boomlet in support in part because manypeople thought he did a good job delivering the homilyat John Paul II's funeral, and in part because hewas a close adviser to the pontiff.""His performance at the funeral certainly solidified his reputation, and ifhe's not elected himself, I don't think anyone can beelected over his objections,"" said John-Peter Pham, a professor atJames Madison University.But Ratzinger turned 78 Saturday, which Vatican analysts say could bea concern because, even though Ratzinger appears healthy, the cardinalsmight want to avoid the prospect of another frail, ailingpope in the short-term.""I think it's going to be a fairly challenging conclave -there's never been a leading candidate, and the reason isthat there are a whole number of opinions, and somuch depends on what the cardinals find to be themajor issue facing the church,"" said the Rev. Keith Pecklers,professor of theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome.Sunday, crowds of tourists milled about a rainy St. Peter's Square,visiting the basilica, taking pictures of the chimney, and talkingexpectantly about the week ahead.""I would like them to choose someone who will continue wherethe old man has left off - not to favorany continent, but to be a universal person,"" said StanAlfwani, a 34-year-old seminarian from Nairobi. Alfwani said he hopesthe next pope will pay particular attention to ""inculturation,"" makingsure that the church is assimilated into different cultures, includingthose of Africa.Yasuhiko Masuoka, 67, of Tokyo said he, too, is hoping fora pope who will carry on John Paul II's policies.But Masuoka also said he would like the cardinals tomake another bold geographic choice, as they did with JohnPaul II, who, as a Pole, was the first non-Italianpope in 455 years.""This time they should choose a pope from Latin America, becauseit will show a more cosmopolitan image to the world,""Masuoka said.Even non-Catholic visitors said they are paying close attention to thegoings-on.""John Paul II was very good for all religions, and wehope that whoever will replace him will do the same,""said Mohammed Salem, 49, of Mauritania, a Muslim tourist whopraised John Paul II's outreach to Islam.Michael Paulson can be reached at mpaulsonglobe.com.
Black smoke rose from the chimney of the SistineChapel Monday evening as cardinals of the Roman Catholic Churchsignaled that they had voted inconclusively in their first attemptto elect a successor to Pope John Paul II.For a few moments, the first wisps of smoke looked whiteto the many spectators drawn to St. Peter's Square inthe Vatican and hopes rose that a pope had alreadybeen chosen. Soon, however, the smoke turned decisively black asit wafted from a stovepipe chimney, blowing in the windsat dusk.The cardinals are to vote again at their conclave on Tuesday.Earlier Monday, the cardinals retreated behind the heavy wooden doors ofthe Sistine Chapel and began the tradition-laden and secret ceremoniesto elect one of their number the 265th pope.In solemn procession, walking slowly in pairs, they proceeded into thechapel as a choir chanted the Litany of Saints, passingbetween a pair of Swiss guards in full regalia. Aftertaking their seats behind long tables, the cardinals were readan oath of secrecy and obedience by their dean, CardinalJoseph Ratzinger. Their birettas, red hats that symbolize the powerof their offices, sat on the tables in front ofthem.Then they lined up and one by one put their handon the Gospel and swore to obey. The entire pageantwas televised live, a first in conclave history and inkeeping with the tradition of John Paul II, who usedtelevision throughout his papacy to promote the faith. Even indeath, his image was broadcast as he lay in stateinside St. Peter's Basilica.""Extra omnes!"" cried Piero Marini, the master of papal liturgical ceremonies-- or ""Everyone out!"" He and a theologian chosen todeliver an inspirational message remained. The rules called for themto leave after the address. At that point, the cardinalswere to decide whether to hold a first round ofvoting Monday night or not.Earlier in the day, they heard another message. Ratzinger, who willbe a powerful force in the conclave, took the occasionof a morning Mass dedicated to the election to denounceanyone who would stray from traditional Catholic doctrine.The 114 other cardinals sat in quarter-circles in front of him.It was the last public rite before the conclave.""A dictatorship of relativism is being built that recognizes nothing asdefinite,"" Ratzinger said, ""and which leaves as the ultimate measureonly one's ego and desires.""For 25 years, Ratzinger served as John Paul's theological right hand-- and watchdog -- as prefect of the Congregation forthe Doctrine of the Faith.In his writings and public statements, Ratzinger has often sought touphold the primacy of Catholicism, saying no other religion offereda path to salvation. ""Relativism,"" he has said, implies --wrongly -- that other faiths are equally valid. The ideawas strongly expressed in a document the congregation issued in2000, Dominus Iesus, which provoked angry responses from other religiousleaders.In his homily Monday, Ratzinger said that Christians were tossed onthe waves of Marxism, liberalism and even ""libertinism;"" of radicalindividualism, atheism and vague mysticism. He also decried the creationof ""sects"" and how people are seduced into them, usinga term church leaders often employ to refer to Protestantevangelical movements.""Having a clear faith, according to the Credo of the Church,is often labeled as fundamentalism,"" he said. ""Yet relativism, thatis, letting oneself being carried 'here and there by anywind of doctrine,' appears as the sole attitude good enoughfor modern times.""Many of the cardinals, draped in bright-red vestments and wearing whitemitres, watched intently as Ratzinger spoke on a platform belowBernini's bronze baldacchino. Several others among them -- two thirdsof the cardinals voting for pope are septuagenarians -- appearedto doze.Ratzinger, 78, spoke Italian in heavily accented German, his voice creakyat times and interrupted by coughs. Several church officials saidhe had been suffering from a cold.The cardinal has emerged as a front-runner in the election forthe next pope, or at least the reference point fora bloc of support generally oriented toward a more conservativeposition. He has been a major force among the cardinalssince John Paul's death on April 2, celebrating the funeralMass and leading the cardinals' regular daily meetings.Commentators agreed that while the cardinal had been saying similar thingsfor decades, hearing them expressed, and so sharply at that,just before the conclave was unexpected. But there were differentinterpretations of his intent.At the funeral, the cardinal showed his pastoral side, said John-PeterPham, a former Vatican diplomat and author of a bookabout papal succession.At the Mass Monday, ""he's giving evidence that he also has,if you will, the 'vision thing,' that he has definiteideas of where the natural progression of John Paul's theologicallegacy is,"" Pham said. ""Whether that's a campaign statement orrequirement of what the next guy must have -- thatremains to be seen.""The message is that John Paul's goals must be maintained, hesaid. ""Either as a candidate or a grand elector, he'sdefinitely in a very strong position, and he wouldn't havemade this statement if he was standing alone,"" Pham said.Alberto Monticone, a professor of modern history at Lumsa Catholic Universityin Rome, called the comments ""a very clear indication ofwhat in his view the attitude of the next popeshould be -- an attitude of struggle against these evilsof the world.""It was likely that most of the cardinals were well familiarwith Ratzinger's thinking, and his belief that the church's firstpriority should be to shore up the doctrinal walls.""It's very honest,"" said the Rev. Gerald O'Collins, a theologian atthe Gregorian Pontifical University in Rome. ""That's what he thinks.""""Some of the cardinals would not agree with his summation,"" hesaid. ""Other things like war and peace and hunger arehigh on the agenda of other cardinals.""After attending the Mass, the Rev. Raymond J. de Souza, chaplainat Newman House at Queens University in Kingston, Ontario, saidthat Ratzinger's homily was an ""exhortation"" to the cardinals togo into the conclave keeping in mind that the primaryresponsibility of a pope is to preserve the faith passedon from the apostles and not to dilute or experimentwith it.""If the faith is strong, then the church can take onthese other issues,"" said de Souza, who writes a syndicatedcolumn.Professor Hans Kueng, a theologian at the University of Tubingen, whohas tangled with Ratzinger, said he heard similar views manyyears ago from him. ""His ideology is a medieval, anti-Reformation,anti-modern paradigm of the church and the papacy,"" he said.
","The process for electing a pope is governed by centuries-old rules with some modernization introduced in 1996. New rules on voting provided that the required 2/3 majority of cardinals would revert to a single majority if no decision had been reached after several days. On the morning of April 18, 2005, Cardinal Ratzinger, a prominent contender for pope, delivered a homily strongly endorsing orthodoxy. That afternoon, after the first voting session, a signal of white smoke from The Sistine Chapel roof, which would indicate election of a pope, turned to black, showing that no decision had been made. ","On Sunday, April 17, 115 Roman Catholic cardinals representing 52 countries and six continents arrived at the Vatican to select a successor to Pope John Paul II. On Monday, they convened a conclave, a secret and sacred gathering, in the Sistine Chapel. Following the cardinals' oath, the selection process began. A two-thirds majority is required to elect a pope. Outside, attention was focused on the chapel roof, watching for the white smoke of burning ballots that would indicate a successful election. Monday, black smoke rose from the chimney. The cardinals would return twice daily, beginning Tuesday, for additional ballots. ","The conclave was introduced to inconvenience cardinals and thus speed up the process. Today it helps preserve secrecy. The opening pageant is televised, then all news media and audiovisual or communication equipment is banned. Cardinals move into St. Martha's House and are forbidden to talk to anyone not sworn to secrecy. In 1996 John Paul II instituted new rules concerning choosing a pope. Until a two-thirds majority is reached the pattern is seven ballots and a day of rest. If a deadlock remains after 12 days, voting may resort to simple majority. Bells will ring when a pope is elected. ","On April 18, 2005, 115 cardinals, all under 80, were sequestered in the Vatican to elect a new pope. After a televised mass, they took an oath of secrecy, then moved to the Sistine Chapel, which had been swept for bugs and contained electronic jammers. They meet twice a day, voting twice each session, until one man receives a 2/3's majority. After each vote the ballots are burned - black smoke signals no one was elected. When a pope is chosen, white smoke will be accompanied by bells. Pilgrims in St. Peter's Square watched the first ballot's black smoke. "
D0917,D0917-B,"Cardinals were deadlocked Tuesday in their search for a new leader of the Roman Catholic Church, as black smoke emerging from a Vatican chimney signalled they had failed in two new votes to elect a pope.To the disappointment of the thousands of people gathered on Saint Peter's Square, the smoke puffing out of the copper chimney above the Sistine Chapel was emphatically not the white they had been hoping for to signal a new pope.For a brief moment there was heart-stopping confusion as the smoke appeared white, and the crowd surged forward toward the Vatican balcony already decked out in purple curtains for the new pope's first public appearance.Again, as after the first ballot late Monday, the plumes turned black and the crowd subsided.""We really thought we had it,"" said Brother Eldi, a monk from Brazil after rushing forward toward the basilica.But less than 15 minutes later more smoke emerged from the chimney, sowing confusion until it too turned black. Vatican television said it was likely the inconclusive ballots were burned in two batches, one for each unsuccessful round.Tuesday's signals mean that the 115 cardinals sequestered in the splendour of the Sistine have now failed in three votes to agree on a successor to John Paul II as the 265th leader of the world's 1.1 billion Roman Catholics.Under a Vatican timetable, the prelates are to convene twice a day, in the morning and the afternoon, and vote twice in each session.In theory, the white smoke signalling a successful election could occur at any time during those hours.The cardinals had earlier trooped back into the Sistine Chapel from their secluded Santa Marta residence. Once inside, they prayed before resuming their deliberations.After the mourning and public emotion over the death of John Paul II, when millions of pilgrims packed into Rome and hundreds of state leaders attended his funeral, the election of his successor is once again keeping the world in suspense.Vatican watchers, rebuffed by the hi-tech secrecy surrounding the debate, were reduced to speculating Tuesday on the course ahead.""Black smoke, time to negotiate,"" headlined the daily Corriere della Sera, citing the only outward indication so far available.""The conclave is looking for agreement after the Martini-Ratzinger duel,"" the paper said, referring to the leaders of opposing camps apparently led by moderate Italian Carlo Maria Martini and the arch-conservative German Joseph Ratzinger.If they cancel each other out as many expect, other possible popes include Dionigi Tettamanzi, the archbishop of Milan who is seen as less conservative than Ratzinger.Bookies have also listed the likes of Nigeria's Francis Arinze, Jean-Marie Lustiger of France, Claudio Hummes of Brazil and the Honduran, Oscar Andres Rodriguez Maradiaga as possible compromise candidates.Predicting an outcome as early as Tuesday, the Corriere della Sera said the cardinals were likely to have broken out into groups, possibly determined by common languages, with ""delegates"" from the two camps as well as a third Latin American current.Whoever is elected pope will take the Church into a new era at a time when Roman Catholicism faces stern doctrinal and moral dilemmas, with conservatives keen to uphold the late pope's strict stance on abortion, contraception, the celibacy of priests and the ordination of women.But many in the Church are pressing for a relaxation of certain strictures, notably to allow condoms in the fight against AIDS but also on issues such as allowing clerics to marry to encourage more to join the dwindling priesthood.To ensure the utmost secrecy during the voting process, the Sistine Chapel -- normally packed with tourists admiring the magnificent frescoes including Michelangelo's Last Judgment -- has been swept for bugs and a special system installed to scramble any mobile telephone communications.Even the Santa Marta residence has been stripped of televisions, radio and newspapers, and extra precautions have been taken to ensure the cardinals do not cross paths with any Vatican official or member of the public.
It was another false alarm -- but for more than a minute Tuesday, thousands of pilgrims in Saint Peter's Square thought the world had a new pope and ran toward the basilica hoping to be the first to catch a glimpse of him.""We really thought we had it,"" said Brother Eldi, a brown-robed Capuchin monk from Brazil, camera at the ready.The puff of light grey smoke -- later to turn black indicating that the cardinals holding a secret conclave in the Sistine Chapel had again failed to elect a pope -- emerged just as the basilica's bells was striking the noon hour.The tolling bells deepened the confusion, since a successful vote is to be accompanied by bells as well as white smoke.""It was a great emotion,"" said Carlos Francisco Alejo Oramas, a seminary student from Mexico. ""There were the bells as well.""Eldi's fellow monk, Brother Leonel from Nicaragua, was content with the deadlock in the chapel. ""It reflects the fact that God works slowly but surely,"" he said. ""This too is the wisdom of the Church, that it doesn't rush things.""Many of the pilgirms, clergy, ordinary tourists and Romans said they would be back Tuesday afternoon when another smoke signal is expected, the result of burning the cardinals' inconclusive ballots and discarded notes.""I hope they'll elect a pope today, because I have to leave tomorrow,"" said Manuel Delmestro from the northern Italian city of Turin.Mike Briggs from Richmond, Virginia, said he had promised his colleagues back home to return with a picture of the white smoke. ""If I go back without it, I'm history,"" said Briggs.The same excitement swept the crowd of more than 20,000 Monday evening, when many believed the first puffs of grey smoke announced the election of the 264th successor of Saint Peter.Some have traveled from across the world to stand in the square waiting for the 115 cardinals to announce their choice to succeed pope John Paul II, who died April 2 aged 84.Father Robert McCulloch, who works as a missionary in Karachi, Pakistan, said he has always wanted to be at the Vatican during the conclave.""Think of how many people have stood here on this square for hundreds and hundreds of years waiting for a new pope,"" said the Australian priest. ""You can really feel the bells of history ringing.""Nearby, the Ostzisk family from western Germany, also travelled specially for the conclave.""It's a historic moment,"" said Agnes Ostzisk, who plans to stay in a tent with her husband and daughter for the duration of the conclave.Meanwhile vendors have caught on to the new needs of the crowd: rather than rosaries, many were selling binoculars Tuesday.
Cardinals sequestered in the Sistine Chapel to elect a pope use an iron stoveand its narrow metal chimney to announce their decision. Black smoke means theyhave failed; white smoke means they have succeeded.It's unclear when the tradition began, but smoke signals have been usedcontinuously since at least 1878.There is little record of color confusion until the 1958 conclave, when the dampstraw that the cardinals had added to their burning ballots apparently failed tocatch, and the initial smoke was white.There was some confusion Monday when the first wisps of smoke appeared white tosome observers. But it quickly became clear that it was black.The Vatican said after Pope John Paul II's death that special chemicals would beadded to help avoid confusion.Archbishop Piero Marini, master of ceremonies for liturgical celebrations, alsohas said when a new pope is chosen, the Vatican will ring the bells of St.Peter's Basilica, in addition to burning the ballots, ""to make the election ofthe pope clearer.""But when the bells rang Tuesday and black smoke poured from the chimney, peoplein St. Peter's Square were further confused. It soon became clear that the bellswere simply tolling because it was noon.In past centuries, conclaves were often held in the town where the last popedied, leaving the cardinals to come up with a means of communication on thespot. They sometimes rang bells to signal a successful election.Smoke was a logical choice because church tradition calls for the cardinals toburn their ballots after each vote to maintain secrecy about theconclave.

German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Tuesday called the choice of CardinalJoseph Ratzinger as pope an ""honor"" for Germany.Ratzinger's election is ""a great honor for our whole country,"" Schroeder toldreporters.Schroeder said Ratzinger, who will be known as Pope Benedict XVI, was a renownedtheologian across the world, and said he looked forward to him attending WorldYouth Day in Cologne, Germany, in August.German President Horst Koehler added: ""That a fellow countryman has become popefills us with a special joy in Germany _ and also a little pride.""
The conservative Roman Catholic group Opus Dei, which enjoyed firm support fromthe late Pope John Paul II, welcomed Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger's electionTuesday as his successor.Opus Dei's prelate, Bishop Javier Echevarria, issued a statement pledgingsupport for the new pontiff. ""This is a time of great joy,"" Echevarriasaid.Opus Dei has what is called a ""personal prelature"", meaning it does not answerto a local bishop.Echevarria said ""the new pope knows the mission of the prelature and knows hecan rely on the joyful dedication of the priests and lay people who compose itto serve the church.""
Joseph Ratzinger, a renowned theologian andprovocative hard-line enforcer of Catholic Church doctrine for thepast two decades, was chosen Tuesday to succeed his friend and closeally Pope John Paul II. Ratzinger, 78, became Pope Benedict XVI, the265th leader of the world's largest and most powerful Christianinstitution.The swift election of the German-born Ratzinger was a vote forcontinuity of John Paul's policies, signaling an endorsement of thechurch's most conservative teachings.The new pope will lead a church in crisis, strongly divided afterJohn Paul's 26-year reign and in sore need of healing. Despite JohnPaul's personal magnetism, many of the church's 1 billion members aredisaffected. The faith is losing ground in many parts of the world toother religions and is under threat from radical Islam and secularism.Minutes after his name was read out to crowds in St. Peter'sSquare, Ratzinger stepped onto a balcony overlooking the multitude anddescribed himself as ``a simple, humble worker in the vineyard of theLord.''``The fact that the Lord can work and act even with insufficientmeans consoles me,'' said the new pope, dressed in flowing white robesand the scarlet papal cape and golden stole, ``and above all I entrustmyself to your prayers.''Meeting secretly for less than 24 hours, Roman Catholic cardinalslocked inside the Sistine Chapel elected Ratzinger on the fourthballot, then burned the papers on which each had disguised hishandwriting and penned a name.White smoke puffed from a chimney on top of the chapel, signalingto the world that one man had received at least 77 votes, the requiredtwo-thirds majority for victory.Details were emerging on how the cardinals made their decision.While many observers had suggested Ratzinger was too polarizing afigure at this critical juncture in church history, several cardinalsappeared to have fallen into line behind the image of a strong leaderwho represented unambiguous moral authority.On the morning of his election, Ratzinger had breakfast with fourcardinals from Asia and Africa. He knew them all by name and spoke tothem in shared languages, according to Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of LosAngeles, who was present.Ratzinger's tough-minded advocacy of Christian identity and theprimacy of Catholicism might have appealed to cardinals in parts ofthe developing world where holders of the faith are under attack andat war with militant Islam or totalitarian regimes.Over the years, Ratzinger has silenced dissent within the churchand labeled other faiths ``deficient.'' At the same time, Ratzinger,who grew up in Hitler's Germany, often is described by admirers ashumble and kind. Everyone agrees on his acute intellectual prowess.George Weigel, one of John Paul's biographers, praised thedecision.``The cardinals chose the best known and most respected of theirnumber, a man they each know as a great listener and a sympatheticlistener,'' Weigel said. ``This was not only a tremendous affirmationof the past (26 and a half) years; it was a vote of confidence inJoseph Ratzinger as the man best fitted to give an evangelical thrustto this papacy, a new dynamism in the first decade of the 21stcentury.''A subdued Belgian Cardinal Gottfried Danneels, possibly the mostprogressive member of the college, said he hoped Ratzinger's taking ofthe name Benedict signaled a shift in the German prelate's focus.``Cardinal Ratzinger remains and will continue to remain the sameperson,'' he told a group of reporters Tuesday night. ``But for themoment he is universal pastor of the church. He is not anymore thehead of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. ... When youare a pope, you have to be the pastor of everyone and everything whichhappens in the church.''Reaction to the election of the oldest pope in two centuries wasmixed, both in a St. Peter's Square packed with people eager to hearthe news and around the world.``It is obvious that in today's world with its multitude ofopinions, not everyone, even in our own church, could and wanted tofollow him,'' acknowledged Cardinal Karl Lehmann, also of Germany.``But his theological work was always respected, even by people withdiffering opinions.''(Optional add end)Since John Paul died April 2 at age 84, Catholics everywhere hadwaited expectantly to learn who would assume the throne of St. Peter.The announcement of the new pope was dramatic. White smoke,indicating a successful election, puffed from a skinny chimney atopthe Sistine Chapel at 5:50 p.m., and many onlookers started to cheer.But the great bell of St. Peter's, which the Vatican had said wouldring to coincide with the white smoke, remained still.Finally, after about five minutes of suspense, the bell began totoll. Applause and chants of ``Viva il Papa'' rang out. People fromacross Rome converged on St. Peter's Square, running through streetsand bridges over the Tiber River to join the swelling crowd.After about half an hour, Chilean Cardinal Jorge Arturo MedinaEstevez, the senior deacon, emerged from behind crimson velvetdraperies onto the balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square.In five languages, he greeted ``brothers and sisters'' and thenannounced in Latin: ``Habemus papum.'' ``We have a pope.''With a flourish he announced the first name, in Latin, Josephum,followed by a pause for dramatic effect. And then: Sanctae RomanaeEcclesiae Cardinalem Ratzinger.The new pope appeared on the balcony, dressed in the papalvestments.
As white smoke streamed from the slender chimney onthe roof of the Sistine Chapel where the cardinals met to elect a newpope, the crowd of tens of thousands filling St. Peter's Square surgedforward.They shouted with excitement: ``Avemos Papa'' (We have a pope.)Some cheered, some sang. Many whipped out cell phones and typed inthe words ``white smoke.''But when Chilean Cardinal Jorge Arturo Medina Estevez announcedthat the new leader of the world's billion Catholics was JosefRatzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, electricity seemed to give way tomatter-of-factness.``We don't know much about him, except that he's quite closelylinked with John Paul II,'' said Ursula Kelly of Ireland's CountyDerry who was in Rome with her husband for their 15th weddinganniversary. ``But we're just so glad to see it.''Some groups applauded, some cheered, but the overwhelming sentimentwas that a larger figure still loomed over the scene -- Pope John PaulII, who died earlier this month.``It's a hard act to follow. He is the only pope I've known,'' saidPaul Anderson, 25, a resident adviser in Loyola University ofChicago's semester-abroad program in Rome.Ratzinger seemed to sense the shadow as well. When he emerged ontothe marble balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square, the first sentencehe uttered as Benedict XVI was an acknowledgment of his predecessor'spower.``After the great Pope John Paul II, the cardinals elected me, asimple, humble worker in the vineyards of the Lord,'' he said.He raised his arms, turning from side to side, clasped his handstogether and blew a kiss to the crowd, which filled the vast squareand spilled into adjoining streets. The new pope appeared stiff andreserved.Cardinal Justin Francis Rigali of Philadelphia, who was lookingdown at the same crowd from one of the adjacent balconies at theVatican, described a scene of majesty as he looked out over St.Peter's Square. ``I was on the balcony to the right, and what a viewit was! All these tens of thousands of people and the wonderfulwelcome they gave the new pope. You heard them chant `Benedicto,Benedicto.' So it started off well,'' he said.Silvana Dal Mas, an elderly sister of the Little Daughters of theHeart of Jesus, who had come to Rome for the conclave and elbowed herway to the front of the crowd, had said she would prefer a LatinAmerican pope, but when Ratzinger was named she quickly adjusted hersights.``I am happy,'' she said, looking up at the balconies filled withcardinals. ``People think the Germans are hard, but I come from nearthe border with Austria, and when the Germans love, it's sincere. Thispope will...,'' she paused. ``He will work very well.''Mario Marazziti, spokesman and a founding member of the SaintEgidio Community -- a Catholic social movement that works with thepoor and refugees -- raced to St. Peter's Square when he heard news ofthe white smoke. He found himself surprised by the new pope'sdemeanor.The usually stern Ratzinger seemed awestruck, even timid as hestood on the balcony of the basilica, looking out at the crowd thathad assembled to greet him.``I think he was uncertain, he was intimidated tonight,'' Marazittisaid Tuesday. ``He used minimalist words. And all of us today are thechildren of John Paul II who regard this strong and timid man ... Iwas moved, I found it tender.''Most excited about his election were groups of young people who hadbeen devoted to John Paul and were eager to transfer their affectionsto a new spiritual leader.Bree Dail, 23, who attends Christendom College in Front Royal, Va.,snagged a seat in the front row on both Monday and Tuesday along witha handful of her fellow students so that she could watch the new popefrom close up. For much of the day, she had prayed the rosary with herfriends, hoping that the cardinals would make their choice.When she heard Ratzinger's name, she leapt up, shouting andcheering -- although she, like so many others, could not help butconnect him to the previous pope. ``They gave us the best, he(Ratzinger) has the heart of the holy father,'' she said. ``We arehappy, we are ecstatic, it's like we have a father.''The day was overcast and chilly. Dark clouds scudded across thesky, making it hard to tell whether the initial curl of smoke risingat dusk from the Sistine Chapel was gray tending to black or graytending to white.As the crowd called out ``Bianco, bianco'' a priest, his cell phoneglued to one ear, came out on one of the terraces that sit atop themajestic colonnade surrounding St. Peter's Square and gesturedfrantically at the bell tower.John Paul had decreed that in addition to sending up white smoke,the Vatican should ring the bells to announce a papal election.The piazza that had only scattered groups of people earlier in theday appeared suddenly to have filled to bursting. A group of Spanishnuns leapt onto chairs and began to chant ``we have a pope.''An older nun reproved them. ``You don't know for certain yet,'' shesaid.So when the great bell finally began to sound, its ring wasoverwhelmed by the roar of the crowd, relieved and excited that theelection of a new pope was real. Some waved papal flags, others flagsfrom their home countries -- Germany and Honduras, Mexico and theUnited States. As people waited, there were lulls in the cheers andsome began to sing Italian hymns or chant prayers in Latin.Vatican staff -- priests, nuns and lay workers -- came out on theroof of the buildings surrounding St. Peter's to watch the ceremony.News and television photographers staged themselves between thestatues that crown the colonnade.As the cardinals prepared to introduce the new pope, acolytesunfurled a velvet banner with the seal of John Paul and hung it infront of the balcony. Then, the grand glass doors behind the papalbalcony were opened and a long, deep-red curtain let fall, making moredramatic the new pope's entrance as it was pushed aside to make wayfor him.The voting cardinals gathered on adjoining balconies, their scarletcassocks and skullcaps contrasting sharply with the white marble,creating a vivid tableaux, but also a moment of sober ceremony as theywatched one of their own move into the most elite realm inChristendom.After a greeting and a few words, Ratzinger said: ``I entrustmyself to your prayers,'' as the crowd chanted his new papal name.With the dusk deepening and a damp wind rising, he ducked backinside the Vatican.With the new pope's departure, the crowd began to drift off. Agroup known as ``Papa Boys,'' an informal youth group that sprang upduring John Paul's jubilee year, rallied a large circle of youngCatholics to sing. Many said they were hoping the new pope wouldreappear.Many who stood on the periphery of the swaying crowd of teenagersand twentysomethings had more questions than answers. ``We'll see ifhe has enough charisma to face this crisis of faith that we have inthe church with people drifting away,'' said Elena Fonte, 35, alawyer. ``I still think of John Paul II as pope; not of Ratzinger aspope.''Times staff writers Sebastian Rotella and Geraldine Baumcontributed to this report.
Pope Benedict XVI may travel less than hisglobetrotting predecessor, but few expect him to act like a caretakerpope.Rather, the 78-year-old pontiff is expected to pursue an activistagenda, topped by a mission to revitalize the Catholic faith andidentity where it is threatened by secularism, particularly in Europe.But after persuading two-thirds of the College of Cardinals toelect him, the new pontiff must now lead a 1 billion-member flock thatis deeply divided over the church's direction and his own promise tostay the course. How he will persuade Catholics that he is pastor tothem all is uncertain.The mixed reaction to the election of Cardinal Joseph Ratzlingerreflects his familiar role as a lightning rod for the harshestcriticism leveled at John Paul's 26-year reign.It was Ratzinger whose Vatican doctrinal office silenced orreprimanded more than 100 Catholic theologians, according to someestimates. He epitomized a centralization of authority in the Vaticanunder John Paul, at the expense of local bishops, while enforcingchurch doctrine against married priests, women in the priesthood,remarriage for divorced Catholics, and homosexual liaisons.Catholics around the world welcomed Ratzinger's election as an actinspired by God. Many others said they were in shock.``This is a disaster,'' said Rea Howarth, co-director of theQuixote Center, a Catholic lay organization based in Brentwood, Md.,that is involved in human rights work in Latin America. ``The churchhas lost so much credibility. Now I'm afraid that more Catholics willjust turn their backs and walk away.''``Ratzinger is a polarizing figure, who seems to prefercombativeness to compromise and compassion,'' said Mary Grant, aspokeswoman for Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests.But some prominent critics of Ratzinger said they were hoping forsomething different in Pope Benedict.The new pontiff held out what some saw as an olive branch in theway he explained the inspiration for his name: Pope Benedict XV, whoran the church during World War I, had given himself to ``peacemaking,reconciliation and harmony,'' the new pope said.That explanation, said Cardinal Gottfried Danneels of Belgium,``gives me some hope'' that Ratzinger will listen to demands frombishops for more ``collegiality,'' or democracy, in church governance.The Rev. Hans Kung of Germany, who was stripped of his authority byRatzinger to teach at Catholic universities for questioning churchteachings, called Ratzinger's election ``an enormous disappointment''but added: ``The papacy is such a challenge that it can change anyone.... Let us therefore give him a chance.''Kung noted that Pope John XXIII, who reigned from 1958-63, hadstarted as a conservative but turned more progressive.Still, the overriding message of Ratzinger's election, on thesecond day of secret voting in the Sistine Chapel, was continuity withJohn Paul.``Of all the men in that room, Cardinal Ratzinger was certainly thesmartest and the one who most represented John Paul II's theology andview of the world,'' said Father Thomas Reese, editor of the NewYork-based Jesuit magazine America. ``They picked the man who wouldcarry on with that legacy.''In an editorial last week, Reese warned the cardinals that ``achurch that cannot openly discuss issues is a church retreating intoan intellectual ghetto.'' He said the next pope must be open to apriesthood that admits women and married men.After Ratzinger's election, Reese said it was clear that suchissues ``will simply remain off the table.''``He sees his first task as protecting the traditional identity ofCatholics in the world against an infinite sea of threats,'' said JohnAllen, who wrote a biography of Cardinal Ratzinger. Opening thepriesthood, for example, ``might create a slippery slope down whichthe church risks losing its identity,'' the author said.``Obviously, the keystone of the Ratzinger pontificate will be oneof preserving traditional teachings rather than tinkering with them,''Allen added.The new pope is expected to stress ``culture of life'' issues,doing battle against gay marriage, euthanasia and stem cell research.He would ensure that theological speculation is contained withinnarrow limits. His governing metaphor for the church of the future isthe mustard seed; it might have to be smaller to be faithful -- whathe calls a ``creative minority.''His focus on Europe is a reaction, in part, to setbacks the Vaticansuffered last year when the European Union refused to mention thecontinent's Christian roots in its new constitution, a decision bothJohn Paul and Ratzinger publicly criticized.Ratzinger's papacy could differ from John Paul's in some importantways.He is likely to spend more time at the Vatican, whipping the Curia,or Vatican bureaucracy, into line with his goals of a more rigorouslyindoctrinated clergy, an improvement of the liturgy and a renewal ofmissionary work. Like most conservatives, he is averse to biggovernment and might streamline the church's central apparatus.And while the late pope championed outreach to leaders of otherfaiths, Ratzinger has said it is of utmost importance to maintainCatholicism as a superior religion.In the 2000 document ``Dominus Iesus'' (Lord Jesus), Ratzingerasserted Catholic primacy and branded other faiths, includingChristian denominations, as deficient. The document incurred the wrathof Protestants, Anglicans, Jews and others. Ratzinger dismissed theprotests as insignificant, further angering his critics.Last year, Ratzinger said Turkey should not be allowed to join theEuropean Union because, as a predominantly Muslim country, it was ``inpermanent conflict'' with Europe.The debate has washed over the church, with many struggling overwhether fundamental differences between the two religions -- whosebelievers are in conflict in parts of the world -- can be bridged forthe sake of dialogue and on the basis of shared moral values.Many cardinals from Asia and Africa, where Catholicism is aminority religion, admired Ratzinger's assertive promotion of thefaith. Although voting was secret, several Vatican watchers speculatedthat significant numbers of cardinals from those continents joinedwith their conservative peers in Europe to give Ratzinger the majorityhe needed.George Weigel, an American biographer of the late pope, saidRatzinger had won enough support among Third World cardinals toisolate a progressive bloc from Europe and the United States that hadopposed his candidacy.``Popes don't invent Catholicism anew,'' Weigel said, dismissingthe idea liberal American Catholics inspired by church reforms of the1960s could sway the new pontiff. ``The Catholic Church isn't going toalter fundamental points of doctrine and moral teaching. If peoplewant to keep fighting the battles of 40 years ago, that's theirchoice, but the church is moving on.''
Rome -- Cardinals from 52 nations, signaling their first vote witha puff of black smoke, began Monday night the processof selecting the 265th leader of the world's oldest dynasty-- the Roman Catholic Church.The stream of black smoke from the chimney over the SistineChapel meant the 115 voting red-robed ""princes"" of the churchhad not reached any conclusion in their search for asuccessor to Pope John Paul II and would return tothe chapel this morning for more balloting. White smoke wouldhave meant a new pontiff.Tens of thousands of faithful watched from St. Peter's Square --millions more on television -- as smoke poured from thechapel's chimney.""It seems white. ... No, no, it's black!"" reported Vatican Radioas the first pale wisps slipped out from the narrowmetal pipe and then quickly darkened.Few expected a hasty decision. The cardinals have a staggering rangeof issues to juggle, from bioethical and medical issues tothe church's relations with Islam, Judaism and other Christian churches.The conclave began as the cardinals filed into the Sistine Chapel,the magnificent chamber adorned by Michelangelo in the 16th centuryand swept last week for electronic listening devices.It was the first time in more than a quarter ofa century that church leaders have gathered to elect asupreme pontiff. And, for the first time ever, television camerasbroadcast the opening ceremonies and the cardinals' procession into thechapel live into St. Peter's Square, and around the world.After their procession into the chapel, the cardinals walked up toa small wooden table and placed their right hands ona large Bible, swearing to uphold the rules of theconclave and to keep its proceedings secret.There is no clear front-runner among the 115 cardinals as towho will replace John Paul to become the next popeand lead the 1.1 billion-member church in the new millennium.The day of solemn ritual began in the morning in St.Peter's Basilica with a special Mass for the Election ofthe Roman Pontiff, attended by thousands of faithful and allof the 115 cardinals.Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the dean of the College of Cardinals, playeda major role in the pre-conclave Mass--just as he didduring the late pope's funeral Mass 10 days ago.In a stern homily delivered to a packed church, Ratzinger said""being an adult means having a faith which does notfollow the waves of today's fashions or latest novelties.""It was classic Ratzinger. He, along with John Paul, has spentmore than two decades reining in the purported liberal excessesof the Second Vatican Council, the sweeping church reforms inthe 1960s that brought the Roman church into the modernworld.""Having a clear faith, based on the creed of the church,is often labeled today as a fundamentalism,"" Ratzinger said inhis homily.""Whereas relativism, which is letting oneself be tossed and swept alongby every wind of teaching, looks like the only attitudeacceptable to today's standards,"" he said. ""We are moving towarda dictatorship of relativism which does not recognize anything asfor certain and which has as its highest goal one'sown ego and one's own desires.""Ratzinger's sermon was greeted with a spattering of applause, including politeacknowledgment from a dozen of the assembled cardinals.But there was sustained applause at the end of the two-hourMass as the cardinals -- some of them smiling --filed past Michelangelo's Pieta, the famous sculpture of Mary holdingthe body of Jesus Christ. It was the last publicevent before the cardinals were sequestered into the conclave.On the steps of the basilica, John and Bonnie Glossinger ofMill Valley paused to reflect on the morning's historic events.""It was very impressive,"" said John Glossinger, was who on abusiness trip to Munich and just happened to be inRome this week with his wife.""All of us just stood there in awe,"" Bonnie Glossinger added.The smoke from the Sistine Chapel in the last moments oftwilight Monday indicated there was a first-ballot vote that resultedin no one receiving the two-thirds' majority required to becomepope. Voting is conducted under a strict veil of secrecy.The ballots are burned -- with chemical additives -- creatingblack or white smoke.In recent conclaves, the single evening vote on the first dayof the gathering has been a largely ceremonial affair.Ratzinger, 78, a conservative German cardinal and the chief enforcer ofCatholic orthodoxy during John Paul's reign, was thought to bein line for a sizable number of those votes. Vaticaninsiders also predicted that Cardinal Carlo Martini, the archbishop ofMilan and a comparatively liberal church leader, would receive ablock of votes of his own from those opposed toRatzinger.Martini, who turned 78 in February, is not seen as aserious papal contender, partly because of his relatively liberal viewsand partly because he suffers from Parkinson's disease, the sameailment that led to John Paul II's demise.Serious balloting is to start today, with two votes in themorning and two in the afternoon.Monsignor Charles Burns, an Irish priest and archivist for the past35 years at the Vatican Secret Archives, said the traditionof locking up the cardinals dates back to the 13thcentury. The cardinals, he said, were taking months to electthe new pope -- spending more time hunting and feastingthan in serious deliberation.""It wasn't to keep people out,"" he said. ""It was tokeep the cardinals in.""It took the conclave nearly three years to elect Pope GregoryX in 1271. The election came only after a mobtore the roof off the building where the cardinals met,exposing them to the elements, and put them on adiet of bread and water to force a decision.This year's conclave is not expected to last that long, eventhough Pope John Paul built a new hotel, Santa Marta,for the cardinals on Vatican grounds, giving them more comfortableaccommodations.Many ""Vaticanistas,"" those on the permanent papal press corps, predict itwill take two to three days to elect a newpope.
","Although many said there was no clear front-runner among the 115 cardinals, Ratzinger's sermon at the pre-conclave mass put him in the limelight for conservatives. On April 19th white smoke rising from the chapel roof at 5:15 p.m. stayed white. Ratzinger had been chosen after four ballots. His victory was cheered widely as an extension of the legacy of John Paul II, but questioned by more liberal elements concerned by a sharply divided church. There was hope in the new pope's explanation that he would be Benedict XVI after Benedict XV who gave himself to ""peacemaking, reconciliation and harmony."" ","On Tuesday, April 19, white smoke puffed from the Sistine Chapel chimney, signaling the election of a new pope. After four ballots, Roman Catholic cardinals elected German-born Joseph Ratzinger, a renowned theologian and hard-line enforcer of Catholic Church doctrine. Ratzinger took the name Pope Benedict XVI. ","In the 13th century cardinals spent more time hunting and feasting than seriously deliberating, so in 1271 a mob tore the roof off their meeting place, exposing them to the elements, and gave them only bread and water to force a decision. Now cardinals are locked up until they decide. Previously, conclaves were held in the town where the last pope died. Smoke became the logical means of signaling a decision because ballots needed to be burned. After John Paul II's death the Vatican stipulated that special chemicals be added to the smoke and bells be rung to avoid confusion. ","In April 19, the new pope was elected on the fourth ballot, signaled by the white smoke and tolling bells. Following the election, Joseph Ratzinger accepted and announced his papal name, Benedict XVI. He was then taken to a dressing chamber nicknamed the ""Room of Tears"", where he donned the papal vestments. A Chilean cardinal then proclaimed ""We have a pope!"" from the central balcony over St. Peter's Square where thousands of pilgrims were gathering. Pope Benedict then appeared and made a brief speech. The electing cardinals were on surrounding balconies. "
D0918,D0918-A," Betty Friedan, a founder of the modern feminist movement in the United States, died here Saturday of congestive heart failure, feminist leaders announced. She was 85. Friedan achieved prominence in l963 with the publication of her book ""The Feminine Mystique,"" which detailed the lives of American women who were expected to find fulfillment through the achievements of their husbands and children.The book sparked a movement for a re-evaluation of women's role in American society and is credited with laying the foundation of modern feminism.She was a founder of the National Organization for Women and a leading advocate of the Equal Rights Amendment, a proposed amendment to the US constitution banning sex-based discrimination, women's rights activists said.""The movement that Friedan's energy sparked continues to grow, and is bigger today than she could ever have dreamed when she helped launch it in the 1960s,"" Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation and a former president of the National Organization for Women, said in a statement. She said many of the advances for women and girls that Americans celebrate and enjoy today ""would not have been possible without her determination and pioneering spirit to challenge the inequities when others dared not speak.""
I try very, very hard not to think of the conservative movement asa gaggle of thick-skulled fanatics. To help me along in this process,I seek out well-reasoned commentary from conservative intellectualssuch as Tod Lindberg of The Washington Times and Ramesh Ponnuru of theNational Review. But my efforts at ideological toleration inevitablyget spoiled when something comes along like Human Events magazine'slist of the ``Ten Most Harmful Books of the 19th and 20th Centuries.''Human Events is a conservative weekly that Ronald Reagan was knownto favor, and which the Wall Street Journal called a ``bible of theright.'' It compiled its list by polling a panel of conservativeacademics (such as Robert George of Princeton University) andWashington, D.C., think-tank types (such as Fred Smith of theCompetitive Enterprise Institute). As such, it offers a fair windowinto the dementia of contemporary conservative thinking.One amusing thing about the list is its seeming inability todistinguish between seminal works of social science and totalitarianmanifestos. Karl Marx, Adolf Hitler and Chairman Mao Tse-tung sitalongside pragmatist philosopher John Dewey and sex researcher AlfredKinsey. You'll be comforted to know that Mao, with 38 points and a No.3 ranking, edged out Kinsey, with 37 points. ``The FeminineMystique,'' meanwhile, checks in at No. 7, with 30 points, just behind``Das Kapital,'' which totaled 31 points.Harmful books that got honorable mentions but couldn't crack thetop 10 include John Stuart Mill's ``On Liberty,'' Sigmund Freud's``Introduction to Psychoanalysis'' and Charles Darwin's ``The Descentof Man.'' Oh yes, and Lenin's ``What Is to Be Done.'' (If you don'tsee the link among arguing for individual rights, exploring scientificmysteries and constructing a brutally repressive Bolshevik terrorstate, then clearly you're not thinking like a conservative.)Interestingly, ``The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,'' a czaristforgery that incited countless massacres and inspires anti-Semitesaround the world to this day, failed to rate a mention. But ``Unsafeat Any Speed'' and ``Silent Spring,'' which led to such horrors asseat belts and the Clean Water Act, did. (Given that ``Unsafe at AnySpeed'' launched the career of Ralph Nader, who went on to put GeorgeW. Bush in the White House, I wonder if conservatives might one daydeem it one of the most helpful books of the last two centuries.)Possibly even more amusing are the explanations for each book'sinclusion. They read like 10th-grade book reports from someright-wing, bizarro world high school. John Maynard Keynes' seminal``The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money'' argued thatduring recessions governments should cut interest rates, reduce taxesand increase spending, and during expansions do the opposite. It makesthe list because, Human Events explains, ``FDR adopted the idea asU.S. policy, and the U.S. government now has a $2.6-trillion annualbudget and an $8-trillion debt.'' (But didn't Keynesian policies helpwin World War II and then produce 25 years of phenomenal prosperity?And wasn't that debt less than $1 trillion before Reagan took office?)The squib on ``The Feminine Mystique'' begins with a fairly anodynesummary of Betty Freidan's pioneering feminist tract. Rather thanexplain what's so dangerous about allowing women the choice of havinga career, though, Human Events proceeds to quote a review that``Friedan was from her college days, and until her mid-30s, aStalinist Marxist.'' Not just a Stalinist, but a Marxist to boot!Personally, I fail to see how Friedan's communist past -- she was42 when she published ``The Feminine Mystique'' -- would discredit herinsights about the repressive nature of a world in which women werediscriminated against or barred outright from most professions andmuch of public life. Especially because the conservative movement wasitself heavily salted with ex-communists. But then, my mind hasalready been poisoned by Dewey, Mill and other liberal relativists.
Betty Friedan, the visionary, combative feminist who launched asocial revolution with her provocative 1963 book, ``The FeminineMystique,'' died Saturday, which was her 85th birthday. Friedan diedof congestive heart failure at her home in Washington, D.C., accordingto Emily Bazelon, a cousin who was speaking for the family. She saidFriedan had been in failing health for some time.Her best-selling book identified ``the problem that has no name,''the unhappiness of post-World War II American women unfulfilled bytraditional notions of female domesticity.Melding sociology and humanistic psychology, the book became thecornerstone of one of the last century's most profound movements,unleashing the first full flowering of American feminism since the1800s.It gave Friedan, an obscure suburban New York housewife andfreelance writer, the mantle to meet with popes and heads of state andto lead an international movement that would shake up marriage and theworkplace, politics and education.She founded the National Organization for Women in 1966, making itthe first new feminist organization in a half century. She also wasamong the founders of the National Women's Political Caucus and thegroup that became the National Abortion Rights Action League.``I never set out to write a book to change women's lives, tochange history,'' said Friedan, who always kept a sense of wonderabout her place in history as the mother of the contemporary women'smovement.``It's like, `Who, me?' Yes, me. I did it. And I'm not thatdifferent from other women. . . .Maybe my power and glory was that Icould speak my truth as a woman and it was the truth of every woman.''Friedan's affinity with mainstream values was the foundation of herauthority. Her emphatic belief that women should have equal rights --but not at the expense of alienating men -- distinguished her frommany feminist leaders who emerged later.``She found that love between unequals can never succeed,'' GloriaSteinem once said, ``and she has undertaken the immense job ofbringing up the status of women so love can succeed.''Her more moderate brand of feminism, combined with her oftenirascible nature, led to ruptures with other movement leaders, such asSteinem and the late Bella Abzug. Some feminists eventually denouncedher as a reactionary.By the 1980s, feminism had ceased being her primary focus, and shespent her last decades focused on issues of aging, families, work andpublic policy.(Begin optional trim)Friedan did not conform to conventional notions of feminine beautyor decorum.She was loud, fast-talking, impatient and abrasive.She remained formidable in her old age. Even as she was approaching80 and enjoying her role as doting grandmother of nine, she coulddemolish interviewers who asked what she considered inane questions.Friedan, from Peoria, Ill., was born Bettye Goldstein on Feb. 4,1921, the year after American women won the right to vote. She was theoldest of three children of Harry Goldstein, a Russian Jewish jewelrystore owner, and the former Miriam Horwitz.Betty (who later dropped the ``e'' from the end of her first name)was precocious and skipped a year of school. In high school, she wasvaledictorian but her braininess, she said, made her feel ``like afreak.''Anti-Semitism barred her father, a successful businessman, fromjoining the country club and other elite Peoria circles, and it keptBetty and her sister out of high school sororities.Her mother was an unhappy housewife whose disposition and healthdramatically improved when her husband's health faltered and she tookover management of the jewelry business. In a 1976 book, ``It ChangedMy Life,'' Friedan said her mother's discontent gave her an earlyglimpse of the perils of the malaise she would later call the``feminine mystique.''Friedan did not feel at home until she arrived at Smith College inthe late 1930s. She became editor of the campus newspaper and quicklyestablished a reputation for brilliance. She finished summa cum laudein psychology in 1942 and entered graduate studies at the Universityof California, Berkeley.At Berkeley, she won a prestigious science fellowship that hadnever been given to a psychologist, much less a female. But she turnedthe award down when it became apparent that her success threatened aphysicist she had been dating. Although she said she had little, ifany, awareness of it at the time, she was fearful of being ``brighterthan the boys'' and violating the mystique she would dissect later.Against the advice of her professors, who included the eminenttheorist Erik Erikson, she gave up psychology all together.Having discovered Marxism in college, Friedan decided that shewould work for the ``revolution.'' By 1943, she was immersed inpopular-front journalism, first at The Federated Press in New York andlater at UE News, the official newspaper of the United Electrical,Radio and Machine Workers of America, then one of the nation's mostradical unions.In 1947 she married a theatrical producer named Carl Friedman, wholater dropped the ``m'' in his last name to create the moredistinctive ``Friedan.'' In 1948 the Friedans had the first of threechildren, Daniel. Four years later when she became pregnant with hersecond child, Jonathan, and requested maternity leave, she was firedfrom her job at the union paper, an event she later would call a``formative experience'' in her evolution as a feminist. Her thirdchild, Emily, was born in 1956.Although she was determined to be a happy housewife, she sufferedrenewed attacks of her childhood asthma and resumed psychotherapy.Urged by her therapist not to waste her education and training, BettyFriedan began to write for women's magazines.She had wanted to write a profile of a woman who had given up asuccessful career as an advertising executive, married and become aserious sculptor, but editors were doubtful that theirhousewife-readers would be interested in such a woman. They acceptedthe article but only after deleting references to the subject'scareer. Within a few years, Friedan said, ``I began to lose my zest(for writing the formulaic articles of women's magazines).''In 1957, she was asked to conduct a survey of her Smith classmatesfor their 15th reunion. She found that the women who did not conformexactly to traditional notions of womanhood were happier than thosewho did. ``Maybe it wasn't education that was the problem, keepingAmerican women from `adjusting to their role as women,' '' she wrote,``but that narrow definition of `the role of women.' ''She wrote a magazine article based on that argument, but it wasrepeatedly rejected. She decided to bypass that venue and put herideas into a book instead.She interviewed scores of suburban women. Another part of herresearch entailed long days in the New York Public Library, lookingfor shifts in the types of heroines depicted in women's magazinefiction. The results of her study were stark: Friedan found that theavid career woman who dominated the magazines in the 1930s had givenway by the 1950s to a less adventuresome model: the contentedhomemaker.Was the 1950s image reality, or was it a self-fulfilling fantasycooked up by magazine editors and advertisers? Friedan was staggeredby the dissatisfactions aired by wives and mothers, by their vaguelaments about feeling empty, desperate and incomplete. A mother offour who had bypassed college for marriage and family told Friedan:``There's no problem you can even put a name to. But I'm desperate. Ibegin to feel I have no personality. I'm a server of food andputter-on of pants and a bed-maker, somebody who can be called on whenyou want something. But who am I?''`` . . . I came to realize,'' Friedan later wrote, ``that somethingis very wrong with the way American women are trying to live theirlives today. . . .For the startling pattern that began to emerge asone clue led me to another in far-flung fields of modern thought andlife, defied not only the conventional image but basic psychologicalassumptions about women.''She found that books on the psychology of women generally adheredto traditional ideas of women's fulfillment in hearth and home.Seeking a theoretical basis for her views of women's plight, Friedanturned to the work on identity and self realization by psychologistsincluding Abraham Maslow and Erik Erikson. Their ideas informed whatbecame her central tenet: ``that the core of the problem for womentoday is . . . a problem of identity -- a stunting or evasion ofgrowth that is perpetuated by the feminine mystique.''Friedan finally produced a 1,000-page manuscript. It took her fiveyears.Friedan's publisher, W. W. Norton, printed only a few thousandhardcover copies in 1963. Friedan did not experience the full force offame until Dell issued the paperback in 1964. That year, ``TheFeminine Mystique'' became the top-selling nonfiction book in thecountry. Much of the initial reaction was not favorable. Friedan wascursed, told to seek psychiatric help and accused of posing ``more ofa threat to the United States than the Russians.'' She was shunned byneighborhood women, her children were kicked out of car pools, and hermarriage began to crack under the weight of her growing celebrity.To many black women more concerned with survival thanself-fulfillment, Friedan's call to women to find meaningful careers``seemed to come from another planet,'' according to historian PaulaGiddings.The personal narrative that gave ``Feminine Mystique'' much of itspower was misleading in another way: It omitted references toFriedan's earlier career as a left-wing journalist, creating theimpression that the author had never been anything other than asuburban matron.Years later, biographer Daniel Horowitz would accuse Friedan ofobscuring her past to sell books. But Friedan insisted she was onlybeing politically savvy. ``It was the McCarthy era . . . and I didn'tgo around parading my left-wing background because it wouldn't havehelped in organizing the women's movement,'' she told the Los AngelesTimes a few years ago. ``On the other hand, I never kept it secret.''``The Feminine Mystique'' was so astute in its analysis that, asfuturist Alvin Toffler said, it ``pulled the trigger on history.'' Thebook launched a tumultuous decade for American women, with Friedan atthe epicenter.In June 1966, Friedan joined members of state commissions on thestatus of women for a national conference in Washington, D.C. Fourmonths later, they reconvened and Friedan was elected president of thenascent National Organization for Women.Among its signature success was lobbying President Lyndon Johnsonto sign an Executive Order prohibiting sex discrimination by federalcontractors.Today, the group is anchored in Washington, D.C., and has 500,000members and branches in all 50 states. But in its early years, NOW'sheadquarters was Friedan's New York City apartment and Friedan wasindisputably in charge.In 1970, the largest feminist demonstration since the suffragemovement took over Fifth Avenue when Friedan called for a nationalWomen's Strike for Equality. Held on the 50th anniversary of thepassage of the women's suffrage amendment, it drew 500,000 women.But during these heady years, Friedan's marriage was crumbling. Sheclaimed years later to have been a battered wife, a contention thatoutraged Carl Friedan, who vociferously denied the charges. Their22-year marriage ended in divorce in 1969.In 1970, Friedan would step down as NOW president amid growingdissatisfaction with her vision of the movement. But not even hercritics could deny the power of the changes she had unleashed.By this time the mother of the movement was being assaulted by itsmore radical elements. In 1969 she had delivered her first publicattack on lesbianism, labeling it a ``lavender menace'' that wouldtarnish the entire feminist agenda. Enraged, many lesbians quit NOW.By the end of the 1970s, Friedan was relegated to the sidelines ofthe movement she had inspired. She was dismayed not only by itsdirection but what she saw as its mounting toll and the growingpolitical backlash. As she saw it, the movement had burdened ratherthan liberated women, burning out those who were trying to jugglemotherhood and career or penetrate the corporate glass ceiling.Moreover, she observed, women in lower-level jobs were still earningonly 59 cents to every dollar earned by men -- this after almost twodecades of renewed feminist activism.Friedan's response was ``The Second Stage,'' published in 1981. Themovement's senior theorist always had insisted that men were not theenemy. In her new book, startlingly, she suggested that the enemy wasthe victim herself.``I believe we have to break through our own feminist mystique,''Friedan wrote, arguing that, ``The equality we fought for isn'tlivable, isn't workable, isn't comfortable in the terms thatstructured our battle.'' Feminists, she charged, had fallen into a newtrap ``which denied that core of women's personhood that is fulfilledthrough love, nurture, home. . . .Calling the feminist foremother ''hopelessly confused about whoseside she's on,`` theorist Ellen Willis wrote that Friedan ''woulddestroy feminism in order to save it, and beat the Moral Majority byjoining it.`` Journalist Susan Faludi, writing in her 1991 book''Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women,`` said Friedanwas ''yanking out the stitches in her own handiwork.``Friedan began to turn her focus to other issues. She received acall from the head of the National Institute on Aging, asking her tobecome an advocate for older Americans. She at first fought the idea,''locked in denial`` about the encroaching reality of her own aging --she was approaching 60 and hating it. What changed her mind wasremembering conversations she'd had with older women while researching''The Feminine Mystique.`` The healthiest and most vital women sheinterviewed had been older women -- in their 50s and 60s -- who hadcareers.In 1993 she published ''The Fountain of Age,`` a book in which sheagain challenged the prevailing stereotypes and argued that an active,engaged life was the secret to a good old age. The book earned mixedreviews, with some critics faulting her for presenting an overlyoptimistic view of the stage of life Friedan herself was experiencing.(End optional trim)In her last years, Friedan split her time between homes in SagHarbor, N.Y., and Washington, D.C. She spent more time with herchildren -- Daniel, a theoretical physicist at Rutgers University whowon a MacArthur Foundation genius grant; Jonathan, an engineer inPhiladelphia; and Emily, a pediatrician in Buffalo, N.Y. -- and theirfamilies.Friedan wrote six books and had teaching posts at manyinstitutions, including Yale, Harvard, the University of California,Los Angeles and the University of Southern California. Surgery in 1997to replace an infected aortic valve slowed her down only a little. Afew years later, she was a distinguished visiting professor at CornellUniversity, where she used a $1 million Ford Foundation grant toconduct a three-year study on women, men, work, family and publicpolicy.She continued to deplore the lack of progress on issues thataffected the quality of family life, such as flexible scheduling andbetter and more affordable child care.Yet she seemed to look back on her life with immense pleasure,saying that the women's movement had succeeded in the United Statesand other advanced countries beyond her wildest imaginings.''I thought once,`` she said, ''about what should be put on mygravestone: `She helped make women feel better about being women andtherefore better able to freely and fully love men.' ``
Betty Friedan, the writer, thinker and activist who almostsingle-handedly revived feminism with her 1963 book ``The FeminineMystique,'' died of congestive heart failure Saturday, her 85thbirthday, at her home in Washington.Her insights into what she described as the soul-drainingfrustrations felt by educated, stay-at-home women in the 1950s, ``theproblem that has no name,'' startled a society that expected women tobe happy with marriage and children. Her book became an instant andcontroversial bestseller, and Friedan became the leading spokeswomanfor a revitalized women's movement.One of the most recognized names and faces of the late 20thcentury, Friedan pushed for equal pay, sex-neutral help-wanted ads,maternity leave, child-care centers for working parents, legalabortion and many other topics considered radical in the 1960s and1970s.Impatient that the federal government, in implementing the CivilRights Act of 1964, did not appear to be taking equal pay for womenseriously enough, she helped found in 1966 the National Organizationfor Women, the largest and most effective organization in the women'smovement, and served as its first president. She led the500,000-person Women's Strike for Equality in New York in 1970, on the50th anniversary of women winning the right to vote.She was a founder of the National Women's Political Caucus in the1970s and of the abortion rights organization now known as NARAL-ProChoice America. She was an organizer and director of the First Women'sBank and Trust.``Many of us think of her as one of the mothers of the modernwomen's movement,'' said Kim Gandy, NOW president. ``She played a verypivotal, very critical role in launching the second wave of the modernwomen's movement.''``She was a giant in the 20th century for women and mostsignificantly was a catalyst for change in the American culture,''said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation.``She defined the problem, and then she had the courage to dosomething about it.''Friedan's was a voice that was loud, insistent and sometimesdivisive. She split with NOW in the 1970s after she came to believethat the organization focused too many resources on lesbian issues andthat too many feminists hated men. Her 1981 book ``The Second Stage''prompted some feminists to denounce her as reactionary.Her 2000 memoir, ``Life So Far,'' said that her husband, Carl, beather during their marriage. He strenuously objected, and Friedanamended the declaration to say that both of them fought physicallyduring their marriage, which ended in divorce in 1969. He died thisDecember.She turned to other issues, focusing on ageism, family issues andeconomic empowerment. ``It isn't that I have stopped being a feminist,but women as a special separate interest group are not my concernanymore,'' she said in 1993.Friedan's cousin, Emily Bazelon, said: ``Her feminism was an aspectof her humanism, and she really cared about the economic well-being offamilies and of all people,'' Bazelon said Saturday.Bettye Goldstein was born Feb. 4, 1921, in Peoria, Ill., the Jewishdaughter of an immigrant jeweler and a mother who quit her job as aneditor of the local newspaper's women's pages to become a homemaker.She later said she felt like an outsider from childhood. She skippedsecond grade and was a high school valedictorian, then moved 1,000miles east to attend Smith College. She edited the college newspaperand graduated summa cum laude in 1942.She did graduate work at the University of California at Berkeleybut turned down a prestigious fellowship in psychology, afraid ofoutperforming her then boyfriend. After the romance broke up, she gaveup graduate work and moved to New York's Greenwich Village to work fora labor newspaper. She married and had a child, but when she becamepregnant with a second child, she was fired.Struggling as a freelance writer, she found that the editors ofwomen's magazines deleted references to her subjects' interestsoutside the home, telling Friedan that the readers did not want toexplore those topics. She was grinding away on a survey of her SmithCollege classmates upon their 15-year reunion, when she added a fewquestions and said she discovered that the highly educated andtalented housewives in their mid-30s were dissatisfied and distraught,drugged by tranquilizers, misled by psychoanalysis and ignored bysociety.No magazine would publish her article. Five years later, aftersignificantly more work, she published ``The Feminine Mystique'' as abook and ``pulled the trigger on history,'' as futurist Alvin Tofflersaid. She pitched it on ``The Jack Paar Show,'' she didquestion-and-answer interviews in magazines and she took everyopportunity to alert the world to the crisis she perceived. The bookeventually sold more than 2 million copies in paperback and remains astaple of college history courses.Daniel Horowitz, a Smith College professor who wrote ``BettyFriedan and the Making of the Feminist Mystique,'' said that althoughFriedan presented herself at the time as a housewife who had an``aha!'' moment, her ideas were partly rooted in the humanisticpsychology that she studied at Smith.She shared a Feb. 4 birthday with Rosa Parks, and both Friedan andCoretta Scott King were at the convention of the Progressive Party inPhiladelphia in 1948, he said.``All three of them have their political roots in the struggles forsocial justice, for African Americans, for women and for workingpeople in the 1940s. Friedan was deeply embedded in and engaged withissues raised on the left in the labor union movement,'' Horowitz saidSaturday. ``In 1943, she wrote, 'Men, there's a revolution brewing inthe American kitchen.' ''During the next several decades, the highly recognizable Friedanwas often seen in demonstrations, protest marches and newsconferences. She suffered insults, not just for her ideas, but for herappearance, which she readily admitted was ``not pretty.''``That great head, the hooded eyes, the broad features of a womanthe French might describe as une jolie-laide@, which refers to amagnificent kind of ugliness that can be attractive, even beautiful,''wrote Washington Post reporter Megan Rosenfeld in 1995. ``The head,looking sometimes like a snapping turtle and at others like a lionwith a white mane, sits atop a surprisingly short body, out of whichcomes the voice of a foghorn in heat. She is always carefully dressedin a New Yorky, nouveau-Bohemian style, with lots of interestingjewelry and spunky little shoes. (She loves to shop, say herfriends.)''Never an organization person, she alienated many who worked withher by insisting on holding the floor, claiming credit and runningroughshod over her assistants. She insisted that the women's movementremain in the mainstream of American life, objecting to the``bra-burning, anti-man, politics-of-orgasm school.'' Younger leaderstook over NOW, and after the publication of ``The Second Stage,''authors as different as Susan Brownmiller and Susan Faludi accused herof reversing the revolution.Friedan declared herself past feminism and went to work on ageism,publishing ``The Fountain of Age'' in 1993. But she never entirelyleft the feminist field, showing up at the 1977 National Women'sConference in Houston to second a resolution on lesbian rights,teaching at numerous colleges, including the University of SouthernCalifornia, and serving on the White House Conference on the Family.She lived in New York City and Washington and had a summer home inSag Harbor, N.Y. Bazelon said services will be held Monday atRiverside Memorial Chapel in New York.Survivors include three children, Daniel Friedan of Princeton,N.J., Jonathan Friedan of Philadelphia and Emily Friedan of Buffalo,N.Y.; a brother and sister; and nine grandchildren.``She's leaving a legacy that's living beyond even her wildestdreams in the '60s,'' Smeal said. ``She wanted to change the world,and she did.''
Last month, Adelphia Communications became the first American cable company tooffer its subscribers triple-X-rated pornography. Adelphia's role as porn pioneerstruck some as a bit unlikely: Five years ago thecompany had dropped Spice, a popular softcore pornography channel, becausethe company's since-disgraced founder and CEO, John Rigas, found itoffensive. Asked about the reversal, a company spokeswoman replied succinctly,""People want it, so we are trying to provide it.The more Xs, the more popular.""Indeed, revenues from pay-per-view and video-on-demand adult movies have quadrupled sincethe late 1990s as cable operators have started airing moreexplicit erotic material. And it's not just cable television that'sembraced the truly lewd. Movies like ""Boogie Nights"" and therecent documentary ""Inside Deep Throat"" have portrayed the adult industryas an enclave for good-hearted, rough-edged misfits and cultural freedomfighters. Last fall the memoir of porn superstar Jenna Jamesonspent a month and a half on the New YorkTimes bestseller list. And the industry itself continues to growat a torrid pace: Hard numbers are difficult to find,but estimates put it at anywhere from a $3 billionto $14 billion a year industry.In response, a predictable political debate has emerged, with cultural conservativesstanding athwart the tide yelling ""Stop!"" while left-leaning civil libertariansbrandish the First Amendment. But there's a voice that's beenconspicuously absent in the current debate: anti-pornography feminists.In ""Inside Deep Throat,"" it is prominent feminists like Gloria Steinemand Susan Brownmiller, as much as decency crusaders like CharlesKeating, who get credit for shutting down the nationwide pornparty that ""Deep Throat"" kicked off in 1972. ""The worstcensors in the country,"" Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz saysin an onscreen interview, ""were the feminists."" The characterization isof a piece with the documentary's cartoony glibness. Still, today,as social conservatives lead the campaign to rid the airwavesof the taint of sex, it's easy to forget thatthe most powerful anti-pornography legislation ever passed in this countrywas written not by cultural conservatives but radical feminists ledby legal scholar Catharine A. MacKinnon and author Andrea Dworkin.MacKinnon and Dworkin's efforts depended on support from notorious bluenoses likePhyllis Schlafly and former attorney general Edwin Meese. But thetwo women's brief against pornography went beyond simply attacking itslasciviousness. They argued that its aestheticized visions of female degradationactually incited men to violence. In 1974 the writer andactivist Robin Morgan had put it most starkly: ""Pornography isthe theory, rape is the practice.""MacKinnon and Dworkin's antipornography statutes-which passed in Indianapolis and Bellingham, Wash.,and were defeated in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and Cambridge-made littleuse of obscenity standards and instead reframed the issue asone of sex discrimination. While their bills didn't ban pornoutright, they allowed women to sue pornographers for damages.And those damages, the anti-porn feminists argued, weren't merely abstract. Duringthe debates over the local ordinances, and in testimony beforeEdwin Meese's Commission on Pornography in 1985, MacKinnon and othersarranged for often horrifying testimony by women on the physicaland mental abuse they had suffered either in the makingof pornography or at the hands of men they claimedhad been inspired by it. Some of the most dramatictestimony was from Linda Lovelace, star of ""Deep Throat.""So what happened to those voices? Now a law professor atthe University of Michigan, MacKinnon has a new book outthis month, ""Women's Lives, Men's Laws"" (Belknap), which includes essaysand speeches on pornography, but in recent years she andDworkin seem to have lost not just the legal battlebut the cultural war. These days, ""sex-positive"" feminists like LauraKipnis or Camille Paglia tend to get the airtime. Andin the universities, women's studies scholars are more likely todo close readings of the aesthetics and politics of pornographythan to march in favor of banning it.Even at the time, MacKinnon and Dworkin's campaign sharply split thefeminist movement. While supported by leading figures like Steinem andBrownmiller, the Indianapolis law in particular galvanized others in opposition.They formed the Feminist Anti-Censorship Taskforce, or FACT. When thelaw's constitutionality was being decided by a federal appeals court,FACT submitted an amicus brief-signed by Betty Friedan, Rita MaeBrown, Kate Millet, Adrienne Rich and others-opposing it.Torn between the conflicting arguments, the National Organization of Women wasunable to take a position. MacKinnon's description of her opponents,in a 1987 speech, was typical of the heated rhetoric:""The Black movement has Uncle Toms and Oreo cookies. Thelabor movement had scabs. The women's movement has FACT.""Starting in the late 1980s some feminist scholars also began tosee porn as a tool that women could appropriate toliberate themselves from patriarchal norms of behavior and beauty. Pornsexuality, they argued, wasn't simply about subjugation. Instead, ""what pornographyis trying to do is create, using real bodies, afantasy of a kind of idealized and perfectly abundant pleasure,""says Linda Williams, a film studies professor at the Universityof California, Berkeley, and a leading porn theorist. What othersmight see as basically a masturbatory aid was cast insteadas a genre of utopian social criticism. As for theanti-porn crusaders, Williams adds: ""Really, who are they to tellus where our sexual imaginations should go?""So it was a deeply divided feminist movement that faced thefailure of MacKinnon and Dworkin's laws, not only in placeslike Los Angeles and Cambridge, but when they were eventuallystruck down by federal courts in both Indiana and Washington.As Joshua Cohen, an MIT political science professor who hasstudied the First Amendment ramifications of the laws, puts it,""A lot of the energy that went into the issueduring the 1980s was focused on these legal strategies."" Whenthey failed, he says, ""It became pretty clear that legalregulations directed to stop pornography were not going to beaccepted by the courts, and that probably sapped some ofthe energy from the anti-pornography movement.""Even where they did survive, the laws had unintended and oftencrudely ironic consequences. In Canada, which in 1992 adopted MacKinnonand Dworkin's definition of pornography, it was used largely toprosecute gay and lesbian bookstores and even to seize copiesof two of Dworkin's books because they ""illegally eroticized painand bondage.""Today, Mackinnon bristles at the old charge that anti-porn feminists were,in effect, in bed with the political right. ""I actuallyknow who I'm in bed with,"" she said in arecent interview. ""This was just something created by the pornographersto scare liberals off, which doesn't take much.""But her language has been adopted by some on the right.Now, according to Janet LaRue of Concerned Women for America,""It may be that we're not hearing as much fromthe traditional hardline feminist organizations, but when I write andspeak on the topic of pornography, one of the aspectsthat I point out is that it certainly subjugates anddegrades women and reduces us to the sum or ourbody parts.""But perhaps it's porn's very ubiquity that has most weakened theanti-pornography case, feminist and conservative. Thanks to the growth ofhome-video pornography in the 1980s and the more recent shiftto the Internet, far more people have access to X-ratedmaterial than ever before. As Williams puts it, ""In away I think MacKinnon and Dworkin were able to invokethe kind of horror that they did at pornography ata time when not as many people had seen it.For better or for worse, now it has become partof the vernacular of our way of talking about picturingsex to ourselves.""MacKinnon agrees, though she sees the shift as more insidious: ""Thedata just show that pornography sets community standards, so themore pornography there is, the less will be seen tobe wrong with it. It's just its own intrinsic dynamic.""Despite the recent backlash against television indecency, pornography prosecutions remain rare.The Bush administration has picked up the pace from theClinton administration, creating a special anti-porn unit in the Departmentof Justice and hiring Bruce Taylor, the prosecutor who wentafter Larry Flynt in 1981, as its porn czar. Lastmonth, the Justice Department announced that it would appeal arecent decision by a federal judge that declared federal obscenitylaws unconstitutional. And speaking earlier this week, the new attorneygeneral, Alberto Gonzales, listed ""the aggressive prosecution of purveyors ofobscene materials"" among his top priorities.Still, Frederick Schauer, a First Amendment scholar at Harvard's Kennedy Schoolof Government, points out that ""criminal obscenity prosecutions have comeclose to disappearing, they're constitutionally permissible but almost nonexistent.... Thelegal definition of obscenity remains very, very, very narrow.""As for MacKinnon, since the early 1990s she has focused oninternational issues like prostitution, human trafficking, and war crimes. (In2000, she won a war crimes conviction against the BosnianSerb leader Radovan Karadzic for the rape of Muslim andCroat women during the Bosnian War.) But she says pornographyis still a central issue for her.""Until a problem is solved, it's always a good time tosolve it,"" she says. ""Whether people want to solve itis another question.""Drake Bennett is the staff writer for Ideas. Email drbennett globe.com
Hillary '08. The inevitability campaign now underway demonstrates everything bad aboutmodern American politics.Two months into George W. Bush's second term as president, acadre of Hillary Clinton supporters is trying to lock upthe Democratic presidential nomination for New York's junior senator. Onesupporter is her husband, former president Bill Clinton, who declaresthat his wife would make an excellent president. Senator JosephBiden of Delaware also predicts ""she is likely to bethe nominee.""So, case closed? No other Democrats need apply? That is ridiculous.For once, some political insiders are trying to put the fixin for a woman for president. But a smoke-filled roomof political power brokers handpicking a female presidential nominee isno more appealing than one that selects one of theboys. And it is likely to be just as inefficientwhen it comes to choosing a winner.Democratic loyalists exerted all their influence to derail former Vermont governorHoward Dean and make Massachusetts Senator John Kerry the partynominee in 2004. With help from Dean and voters inIowa and New Hampshire, they succeeded. Then Kerry lost inNovember.Hillary Clinton has a strong case to make to Democrats andindependents. She is a celebrity politician who can raise money.Early polls put her ahead of Kerry and other Democraticpresidential hopefuls. Results from one recent poll showed that sixin 10 voters believe that the United States is readyfor a female president, and 53 percent thought Hillary Clintonshould try for the job.She has the next three years to build her case {ndash}and so should other Democrats with different ideas about partydirection and agenda.As a couple, the Clintons are skilled at political repositioning. Rightnow it's all about grabbing the middle, as defined bythe 2004 presidential election.Hillary Clinton went public with the view that avoiding abortion isthe correct goal for prochoice advocates. She reached out toreligious conservatives with an endorsement of faith-based initiatives. With her2006 reelection campaign approaching, she is wooing New York Republicans.She backs the Bush doctrine in Iraq.As for Bill Clinton, at the request of President George W.Bush, he is leading the US tsunami relief effort withformer President George H.W. Bush. On their tour of tsunamidamage in Southeast Asia, Clinton allowed the elder Bush tosleep on the plane's only bed while he stretched outon the floor, according to Newsweek. In this instance, Clinton'sdedication to the cause could be viewed as a politicaltwo-fer: tsunami relief and Hillary '08. It projects a beautifulphoto-op to red state America. But is it beautiful enoughto make Clinton-haters forget why they hate the Clintons?To believe that is naive. It also fails to acknowledge theGOP's well-established path to victory. Republican campaign strategists create theirown image of the Democratic challenger; they do not acceptthe image promoted by the opposition. The GOP-inspired image isseared into voters' minds through relentless advertising, talking points, andconservative talking heads. So far, Democrats have not come upwith a successful antidote.In 2004, Republicans {ndash} with help from the Democratic candidate {ndash}made sure the Democratic nominee was John Kerry, flip-flopper andVietnam War protester, not John Kerry, political centrist and VietnamWar hero.If Hillary Clinton is the Democratic presidential nominee in 2008, theGOP will run against Hillary Clinton as defined by theGOP, not as defined by the Democratic Party.In the end, the Clintons may be resilient and resourceful enoughto beat back Republican spin doctors. They certainly have experiencedoing so. But no one should be fooled into believingthat electing a woman generally and Hillary Clinton specifically willhappen easily. It will take hundreds of millions of dollars,tremendous will, and ugly political warfare.In remarks following a recent speech at Wellesley College, Hillary Clinton'salma mater, feminist Betty Friedan scoffed at the notion ofa presidential face-off between two women, Clinton and Secretary ofState Condoleezza Rice. ""It will never happen,"" she said.It might; in politics, anything can happen. But it's too earlyto pick a presidential candidate and way too early totry to dictate who should be a party's presidential nominee.Joan Vennochi's e-mail address is vennochiglobe.com.
When Judith Warner was researching her book ""Perfect Madness,""a sharply observed study of motherhood in today's culture, theTV series ""Desperate Housewives"" was not yet part of thezeitgeist.But the book and the TV soap sing an almost perfectduet of disharmony together, each from a distinct point ofview. The TV character most stay-at-home moms identify with isLynette Scavo (Felicity Huffman), the frazzled mother who gave upher career to raise an unmanageable brood, and who feelsshe can never quite catch up to her life.And that feeling is one of the threads that run through""Madness,"" which has ridden a surge of media attention (aNewsweek cover story, two big pops on the ""Today"" showwith Katie Couric) to debut at No. 9 on TheNew York Times Bestseller List.""There's a widespread feeling in the culture now that things havegone too far, that there's this insanity, and I thinkLynette and my book both tap that feeling,"" Warner says.But where the jolts of recognition in ""Housewives"" are embedded insilliness, ""Perfect Madness"" is perfectly serious, a book that strivesto be an updated take on Betty Friedan's groundbreaking ""TheFeminine Mystique."" Friedan wrote about ""The Problem That Has NoName"" (but which had much to do with being desperateand a housewife), and Warner is concerned about ""The NewProblem That Has No Name,"" which bundles together many things,including motherhood, perfectionism and guilt.""That caught-by-the-throat feeling so many mothers have today of always doingsomething wrong,"" she calls it.Warner has received a lot of response from mothers about ""Madness.""""I hear the positive feedback, 'cause that's what they'll tell meto my face,"" she says. But she also has readsome of the Web log responses, which cover a widerange.One blogger accused her of being a sniper in the ""MommyWars"" -- mothers criticizing other mothers for staying home, forworking in an office, for using or not using daycare, for being too involved or not involved enough.Warner disagrees.""This is not mommy bashing,"" Warner says of the book.Warner, the mother of daughters ages 4 and 7, was aNewsweek correspondent based in Paris, where she saw much moresupport for young mothers. When she moved back to Washington,she was appalled by the parents who camped out inline to get their children into the right preschool, whomedicated their children for the tiniest reason and who obsessivelybought every Baby Einstein and Baby Mozart product that cameout.""A generation of control freaks"" she calls them in the book.She is both one of them herself, she acknowledges, andan observer, apart.An example, she says, is occupational therapy for preschoolers. ""I don'tknow about the rest of the country,"" she said, ""butin New York and Washington, D.C., tons and tons ofkids are in OT to work on their fine motorskills. You have schools where practically every 4-year-old boy isin OT to improve his handwriting and scissor skills. Anyonewith a grain of common sense knows this is excessive.""The overall tone of ""Madness"" is sympathetic to moms.But Warner can be critical of ""hyperparenting,"" and she finds plentyof other groups to criticize for the mom madness, including:The media. Especially magazines that seem obsessed with chronicling what somecall ""the work-life balance"" -- articles that Warner says canmake mothers feel inadequate. ""Nearly every story comes with amessage: You can take control,"" she writes.Husbands, for obvious reasons. She recounts excerpts from the interviews sheconducted with several hundred women. The anger and frustration overhow little men help with child-rearing comes pouring out. ""Ihave learned that I am basically going it alone,"" onewoman tells her -- sounding exactly like Lynette.Advocates of all stripes. ""The culture wars between social conservatives andfeminists, which take place far from the concerns of mostAmericans,"" she writes, ""are a huge and terrible waste ofresources. They have left women holding the bag, with virtuallynothing to show for themselves, after three decades of women's'liberation' and of New Right 'family values' activism.""Society. ""It's really your country -- and not your child, notyour family, not yourself -- that is entirely out ofcontrol,"" she writes. She argues for a nonpartisan agenda ofsocial changes that would include affordable and high-quality day care,health care for part-time workers and their families, and incentivesfor businesses with pro-family policies, saying most of that couldbe accomplished with changes in the tax laws.""I kept the political part of it really short, to abouta chapter,"" she says, ""but I've been shocked by theextent people are interested in the policy implications.""""We need to start looking critically at family dynamics -- thestress, the perpetual motion, the anxiety.

The Feminine Mystique"" jump-started the women's movement more than 40 yearsago with its exposé on the discontent among American womenover the tyranny of domesticity.These days, many Gen-X and Gen-Y mothers are experiencing that samediscontent.""You become so absorbed in 'attachment parenting,' you put so mucheffort into it that you're lucky to get a shower,""says Anne-Marie Nichols, 40, of Firestone, who writes the newsletterfor the national organization MOTHERS (Mothers Ought to Have EqualRights.)A former marketing copywriter, she's now full-time mom to two toddlersand president of the board of directors of a charterschool. She believes that her generation, unlike the one thatcame of age in the 1960s and '70s, has failedto create social change for women through political action.""After a certain point you think, 'Who cares how people voted?'Your husband is yelling at you, there's no clean underwear,you didn't get to the store, and there are pilesof laundry all over.""But in the past few years, a handful of organizations havebegun to forge what's called ""The 21st Century Mothers Movement.""Forget getting husbands to do more housework. They want sweeping socialchange, a pro-mother political agenda that would eliminate policies andpractices that unfairly affect women as caregivers.They advocate for affordable day care, tax breaks for corporations thatallow mothers to work part time, and laws that providehealth-care benefits.""Motherhood remains the crucial unfinished business of the women's movement,"" saysSusan Douglas, author of ""The Mommy Myth: The Idealization ofMotherhood and How It Has Undermined Women.""But there's significant disagreement over the need for changing the systemto help mothers.""We emphasize the importance of motherhood,"" says Janice Crouse, senior fellowof the think tank Concerned Women of America in Washington,D.C., which works to bring biblical principles into public policy.She agrees that motherhood is extremely stressful, with a litany ofdemands ranging from high-pressured kids' activities to impossible standards ofperfection.""But it seems to me that, once again, they are lookingfor a governmental solution -- for someone else to solvetheir problems,"" says Crouse.As a mother of grown children, she says, ""There were daysthat I wondered if I would survive. I very definitelyidentify with what they call 'mommy madness.' But there's asense of unrealistic expectations.""We can't as women speak out both sides of our mouth.On one hand, ask to be taken seriously and consideredrational, intellectual beings. And on the other hand, say 'Ohmy goodness, I can't cope, this is too hard, someone'sgot to help me.'""I feel like saying, 'You're a grown woman. Take control ofyour schedule.' If you can't manage that, you can't managea company or a very demanding career.""In her new book ""Perfect Madness: Motherhood in the Age ofAnxiety,"" Judith Warner also criticizes the emerging mother's movement. Hercomplaint is that it's unfocused and ineffective.But pioneers of the movement refuse to quit. They target whatthey consider inflexible workplace practices and outdated policies, which theybelieve increase the odds that mothers will experience financial insecurityand diminished well-being over a lifetime.""A 'perfect storm' of unfavorable economic and social conditions harms allwomen who mother, but the consequences are most severe forlow-income mothers, single-parent mothers and mothers of color,"" said JudithStadtman Tucker, at a recent conference on motherhood in Toronto.To reach the tipping point will require an ""open discourse aboutthe new future of motherhood,"" said Tucker, who is editorand founder of The Mothers Movement Online.Evidence of this dialogue percolating in pop culture includes blogger moms,mama-zines, Web sites, e-newsletters, and a deluge of trendy ""momoirs""-- memoirs written by mothers.This Mother's Day, activist campaigns will range from the ""Mamas RisingUp! Festival"" in Brooklyn, N.Y., to blogger moms railing onthe Web site of the national advocacy organization Mothers &More.""Cultural politics is often a necessary prelude to political politics,"" saysDouglas. ""We are in a consciousness-raising mode right now.""In February, Newsweek ran a cover story on the myth ofthe perfect mother, based on Warner's book. She described a""nationwide epidemic"" of ""craziness"" in which 70 percent of Americanmoms find motherhood ""incredibly stressful.""This brings to mind, she wrote, ""Betty Friedan's 1963 classic, 'TheFeminine Mystique.' The diffuse dissatisfaction. The angst, hidden behind allthe obsession with trivia, and the push to be perfect... And the tendency, every bit as pronounced among mypeers as it had been for the women Friedan interviewed-- to blame themselves for their problems.""The story triggered more than 600 letters from grateful readers.""This generation of women isn't like (that of) the '60s, whichprotested and tried to change things,"" says Laura Nevitt, presidentof the Denver chapter of Mothers & More.""I read that piece and thought, 'This is so me!' Ilook at myself, and focus on what I am notdoing instead of trying to get other people to helpme. I'm trying to be so self-sufficient.""Modern mothers aren't just isolated, Warner argued. They also are bredto rely on their own initiative, and to privatize theirproblems.A few months earlier, an episode of ""Desperate Housewives"" targeted theproblem. Lynette, the stay-at-home mother of four hellacious children, hasa meltdown and runs away. After two friends track herdown, she explains that she feels like a failed mother.They confide they feel the same way -- but justdon't admit it.In communities across America, ""mothers were talking about that episode,"" saysDouglas. ""It was like a shock wave, because it wasone of the most honest moments on TV about motherhood.It hit a nerve, making fun of the myth ofthe perfect mother and the myth of domestic bliss --that you become a housewife and it's just heaven.""Joan Williams, author of ""Unbending Gender: Why Family and Work Conflictand What to Do About It,""argues that domesticity is the root of the problem. This gender-basedeconomic system arose about 1780, and still drives the U.S.workplace, which is comprised of two types of workers: theideal, who works full time and has no time toraise children, and the family caregiver, who is marginalized, cutoff from professional and social advancement.""Once the focus shifts away from women's choices to the gendersystem that sets the frame within which those choices occur,we can see that domesticity's peculiar structuring of market workand family work hurts not only women but also men,children, politics and our emotional life,"" she wrote.Williams, an American University law professor, is director of the Programon WorkLife Law, which seeks to eliminate employment discrimination againstcaregivers.She's optimistic about motherhood and social action.""Since the 1970s women have accomplished something stunning,"" she says. ""TheU.S. is probably the best country in the world forwomen who are willing to live the biographies of amale. But it's probably one of the worst countries inthe world for mothers.""So the next frontier is to change the family hostile atmospherefor men as well as women. That will jump-start thestalled revolution.""
Throughout its lifetime, feminism has spawned its share of catchphrases andepithets. Simone de Beauvoir gave us ""the second sex."" BettyFriedan invented ""the feminine mystique."" Arlie Hochschild labeled the dailyhousework that followed office work ""the second shift,"" while RushLimbaugh contributed ""feminazis"" to the discourse.Now another phrase -- choice feminism -- is suddenly gaining currency,while managing to annoy people on the left, right andjust about everywhere in between.This seemingly innocuous term, coined by a lawyer and scholar, LindaR. Hirshman, in the December issue of The American Prospect,refers to the popular feminist philosophy that in her wordsdeclares ""a woman could work, stay home, have 10 childrenor one, marry or stay single."" ""It all counted as'feminist' as long as she chose it,"" Hirshman wrote.The concepts behind choice feminism took over the mainstream in the1980s, replacing more militant agendas that derided or neglected familylife. The idea was that women should decide for themselveshow to combine children, career, romance and vacuuming. What itdidn't tell them was how to make the right decision.Figuring out the balance between home and work turned outto be a lot trickier than anyone thought.Hirshman would like to help -- though not in a waymany women would welcome. In her article she denounced choicefeminism as a con. It promised liberation, she said, butactually betrayed women by leaving traditional sex roles intact. Inshort, women were still stuck with the housework and child-rearing.The public sphere, outside the home, she argued, is theonly place where women can fully flourish. And that, sheproclaimed, is where they should be.She issued a few simple rules: Marry someone poorer or sociallyinferior; increase your tolerance of dust. And, as she putsit: ""Have a baby. Just don't have two.""On the Web and elsewhere, responses were quick, numerous and fierce.There were a few supporters, but many more critics. Conservativessaw her argument as another example of how feminists areintent on destroying the family. Liberals criticized her for beingauthoritarian and defining success only by money and status. Mothersdenounced her for just about everything.What is perhaps most surprising, though, is not that feminists likeHirshman believe homemaking is second-class drudgery, but that so manypeople still get worked up over the issue. After all,feminist thinkers have been proclaiming the need to free womenfrom the bondage of housework for a long time. Itis, as Hirshman freely acknowledges, precisely what Friedan argued in""The Feminine Mystique,"" first published more than 40 years ago.""The only kind of work which permits an able woman torealize her abilities fully,"" Friedan wrote, ""is the kind thatwas forbidden by the feminine mystique, the lifelong commitment toan art or science, to politics or profession."" Not homemaking,not motherhood.In an interview, Hirshman said that in the course of researchinga book, she began to wonder when feminism switched fromoffering a clear blueprint for liberation to choosing from ColumnA and Column B.""I was curious to see when we got to the placewhen they decided to sidestep the definition of the goodlife by Friedan,"" she said, ""to whatever floats your boats.""She traced the change to the late '80s, when the women'smovement decided to frame the debate over legalized abortion asa question of a woman's choice. The language, she says,""spilled over.""That Hirshman's views on family life now sound so radical isa testament to how roundly the mainstream has rejected them.While rigid doctrines may have made sense in the earlydays, they don't now, when major goals have been wonand a more diverse group of women are in thepicture. Indeed, the common critique of the women's movement inthe '60s and '70s was that it was too elitistand dogmatic, that it didn't respect women who wanted tostay home.Choice feminism was an adjustment to reality. But reality, of course,is messy and confusing. It's not clear what should givewhen women are still responsible for a disproportionate share ofthe housework, they miss their children while they're at workall day, good child care is expensive, and time offor part-time work hampers a career.In the continuing Web discussion about Hirshman's article, many women angrywith her conclusions still agreed with her complaints about theunequal burden between men and women for home and family.A Web site called the Half Changed World, for example, writtenby a self-described mom and policy wonk, said: ""I honestlydon't know what's going to break through the domestic glassceiling. I used to think that it just was goingto take time, that of course the younger generation wouldadopt a more equitable distribution of labor. I don't seethat happening.""Choice feminism doesn't provide any formula or model for happily balancingfamily, work, love, chores, play, sleep and more. Nothing doesanymore.""We've been living through this massive transformation where those predictable pathwayshave really eroded,"" said Kathleen Gerson, a New York Universitysociologist.That is why edicts that order women either to get outof the house or to stay there inevitably resurface. Issuingmarching orders is simple. ""Viva la revolucion!"" is a lotcatchier than ""Muddle Through!"" It's just not helpful.
Betty Friedan, the feminist crusader and author whose searing first book,""The Feminine Mystique,"" ignited the contemporary women's movement in 1963and in so doing permanently transformed the social fabric ofthe United States and countries around the world, died Saturday,her 85th birthday, at her home in Washington.The cause was congestive heart failure, said Emily Bazelon, a familyspokeswoman.With its impassioned yet clear-eyed analysis of the issues that affectedwomen's lives in the decades after World War II --including enforced domesticity, limited career prospects and, as chronicled inlater editions, the campaign for legalized abortion -- ""The FeminineMystique"" is widely regarded as one of the most influentialnonfiction books of the 20th century. Published by W.W. Norton& Co., the book had sold more than 3 millioncopies by the year 2000 and has been translated intomany foreign languages.For decades a familiar presence on television and the lecture circuit,Friedan, with her short stature, round figure, protuberant nose anddeeply hooded eyes, looked for much of her adult lifelike a ""combination of Hermione Gingold and Bette Davis,"" asJudy Klemesrud wrote in The New York Times Magazine in1970.""The Feminine Mystique"" made Friedan world famous. It also made herone of the chief architects of the women's liberation movementof the late 1960s and afterward, a sweeping social upheavalthat harked back to the suffrage campaigns of the turnof the century and would be called feminism's second wave.In 1966, Friedan helped found the National Organization for Women, servingas its first president. In 1969, she was a founderof the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws,now known as Naral Pro-Choice America. With Gloria Steinem andBella Abzug, she founded the Women's Political Caucus in 1971.Though in later years, some feminists dismissed Friedan's work as outmoded,a great many aspects of modern life that seem routinetoday -- from unisex Help Wanted ads to women inpolitics, medicine, the clergy and the military -- are thedirect result of the hard-won advances she helped women attain.A brilliant student who had graduated summa cum laude from SmithCollege in 1942, Friedan had trained as a psychologist buthad never pursued a career in the field. When shewrote ""The Feminine Mystique,"" she was a suburban housewife andmother who supplemented her husband's income by writing freelance articlesfor women's magazines.Though Friedan was not generally considered a lyrical stylist, ""The FeminineMystique,"" read today, is as mesmerizing as it was morethan four decades ago:""Gradually, without seeing it clearly for quite a while, I cameto realize that something is very wrong with the wayAmerican women are trying to lives their lives today,"" Friedanwrote in the opening line of the preface. ""I sensedit first as a question mark in my own life,as a wife and mother of three small children, half-guiltily,and therefore half-heartedly, almost in spite of myself, using myabilities and education in work that took me away fromhome.""The words have the hypnotic pull of a fairy tale, andfor the next 400 pages, Friedan identifies, dissects and damninglyindicts one of the most pervasive folk beliefs of postwarAmerican life: the myth of suburban women's domestic fulfillment shecame to call the feminine mystique.Drawing on history, psychology, sociology and economics, as well as oninterviews she conducted with women across the country, Friedan chartedthe gradual metamorphosis of the American woman from the independent,career-minded New Woman of the 1920s and '30s into thevacant, aproned housewife of the postwar years.(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)The portrait she painted was chilling. For a typical woman ofthe 1950s, even a college-educated one, life centered almost exclusivelyon chores and children. She cooked and baked and bandagedand chauffeured and laundered and sewed. She did the moppingand the marketing and took her husband's gray flannel suitto the cleaners. She was happy to keep his dinnerwarm till he came wearily home from downtown.The life she led, if educators, psychologists and the media wereto be believed, was the fulfillment of every women's mostardent dream. Yet she was unaccountably tired, impatient with thechildren, craving something that neither marital sex nor extramarital affairscould satisfy. Her thoughts sometimes turned to suicide. She consulteda spate doctors and psychiatrists, who prescribed charity work, bowlingand bridge. If those failed, there were always tranquilizers toget her through her day.A Nebraska housewife with a Ph.D. in anthropology whom Friedan interviewedtold her:""A film made of any typical morning in my house wouldlook like an old Marx Brothers comedy. I wash thedishes, rush the older children off to school, dash outin the yard to cultivate the chrysanthemums, run back into make a phone call about a committee meeting, helpthe youngest child build a blockhouse, spend fifteen minutes skimmingthe newspapers so I can be well-informed, then scamper downto the washing machines where my thrice-weekly laundry includes enoughclothes to keep a primitive village going for an entireyear. By noon I'm ready for a padded cell. Verylittle of what I've done has been really necessary orimportant. Outside pressures lash me though the day. Yet Ilook upon myself as one of the more relaxed housewivesin the neighborhood.""(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)""The Feminine Mystique"" began as a survey Friedan conducted in 1957for the 15th reunion of her graduating class at Smith.It was intended to refute a prevailing postwar myth: thathigher education kept women from adapting to their roles aswives and mothers. Judging from her own capable life, Friedanexpected her classmates to describe theirs as similarly well adjusted.But what she discovered in the women's responses was somethingfar more complex, and more troubling -- a ""nameless, achingdissatisfaction"" that she would famously call ""the problem that hasno name.""When Friedan sent the same questionnaire to graduates of Radcliff andother colleges, and later interviewed scores of women personally, theresults were the same. The women's answers gave her theseeds of her book. They also forced her to confrontthe painful limitations of her own suburban idyll.Bettye Naomi Goldstein was born on Feb. 4, 1921, in Peoria,Ill. Her father, Harry, was an immigrant from Russia whoparlayed a street-corner collar-button business into a prosperous downtown jewelrystore. Her gifted, imperious mother, Miriam, had been the editorof the women's page of the local newspaper before givingup her job for marriage and children. Only years later,when she was writing ""The Feminine Mystique,"" did Friedan cometo see her mother's cold, critical demeanor as masking adeep bitterness at giving up the work she loved.Growing up brainy, Jewish, outspoken and, by the standards of thetime, unlovely, Bettye was ostracized. She was barred from thefashionable sororities at her Peoria high school and rarely askedon dates. It was an experience, she would later say,that made her identify with people on the margins ofsociety.At Smith, she blossomed. For the first time, she could beas smart as she wanted, as impassioned as she wantedand as loud as she wanted, and for four happyyears she was all those things. Betty received her bachelor'sdegree in 1942 -- by that time she had droppedthe final ""e,"" which she considered an affectation of hermother's -- and accepted a fellowship to the University ofCalifornia, Berkeley, for graduate work in psychology.At Berkeley, she studied with the renowned psychologist Erik Erikson, amongothers. She won a second fellowship, even more prestigious thanthe first, that would allow her to continue for doctorate.But she was dating a young physicist who felt threatenedby her success. He pressured her to turn down thefellowship, and she did, an experience she would later recountfrequently in interviews. She also turned down the physicist, returninghome to Peoria before moving to Greenwich Village in NewYork.There, Friedan worked as an editor at The Federated Press, asmall news service that provided stories to labor newspapers nationwide.In 1946, she took a job as a reporter withU.E. News, the weekly publication of the United Electrical, Radioand Machine Workers of America. In 1947, she married CarlFriedan, a theater director who later became an advertising executive.They started a family and moved to a rambling Victorianhouse in suburban Rockland County, N.Y.Betty Friedan, whose marriage would end in divorce in 1969, issurvived by their three children, Daniel Friedan of Princeton, N.J.;Emily Friedan of Buffalo, N.Y.; and Jonathan Friedan of Philadelphia;a brother, Harry Goldstein, of Palm Springs, Calif., and Purchase,N.Y.; a sister, Amy Adams, of New York City; andnine grandchildren.""The Feminine Mystique"" had the misfortune to appear during a newspaperprinters' strike. The reviews that appeared afterward ran the gamutfrom bewildered to outraged to cautiously laudatory. Some critics alsofelt that Friedan had insufficiently acknowledged her debt to Simonede Beauvoir, whose 1949 book, ""The Second Sex,"" dealt withmany of the same issues.Writing in The New York Times Book Review in April 1963,Lucy Freeman called ""The Feminine Mystique"" a ""highly readable, provocativebook,"" but went on to question its basic premise, writing,of Friedan:""Sweeping generalities, in which this book necessarily abounds, may hold acertain amount of truth but often obscure the deeper issues.It is superficial to blame the 'culture' and its handmaidens,the women's magazines, as she does. What is to stopa woman who is interested in national and international affairsfrom reading magazines that deal with those subjects? To paraphrasea famous line, 'The fault, dear Mrs. Friedan, is notin our culture, but in ourselves.""'Among readers, however, the response to the book was so overwhelmingthat Friedan realized she needed more than words to addressthe condition of women's lives. After moving back to Manhattanwith her family, she was determined to start a progressiveorganization that would be the equivalent, as she often said,of an NAACP for women.In 1966, Friedan and a group of colleagues founded the NationalOrganization for Women. She was its president until 1970.(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)One of NOW's most visible public actions was the Women's StrikeFor Equality, held on Aug. 26, 1970, in New Yorkand in cities around the country. In New York, tensof thousands of woman marched down Fifth Avenue, with Friedanin the lead. (Before the march, she made a pointof lunching at Whyte's, a downtown restaurant formerly open tomen only.)Carrying signs and banners (""Don't Cook Dinner -- Starve a RatTonight!"" ""Don't Iron while the Strike Is Hot""), women ofall ages, along with a number of sympathetic men, marchedjoyfully down the street to cheering crowds. The march endedwith a rally in Bryant Park, behind the New YorkPublic Library, with passionate speeches by Friedan, Steinem, Abzug andKate Millett.Not all of Friedan's ventures were as successful. The First Women'sBank and Trust Co., which she helped found in 1973,is no longer in business. Nor were even her indomitablepresence and relentless energy enough to secure passage of theEqual Rights Amendment.Though widely respected as a modern-day heroine, Friedan was by nomeans universally beloved, even -- or perhaps especially -- bymembers of the women's movement. She was famously abrasive. Shecould be thin-skinned and imperious, subject to screaming fits oftemperament.In the 1970s and afterward, some feminists criticized Friedan for focusingalmost exclusively on the concerns of middle-class married white womenand ignoring those of women of color, lesbians and thepoor. Some called her retrograde for insisting that women could,and should, live in collaborative partnership with men.Friedan's private life was also famously stormy. In her recent memoir,""Life So Far"" (Simon & Schuster, 2000), she accused herhusband of being physically abusive during their marriage, writing thathe sometimes gave her black eyes, which she concealed withmake-up at public events and on television.Carl Friedan has repeatedly denied the accusations. In an interview withTime magazine in 2000, shortly after the memoir's publication, hecalled Friedan's account a ""complete fabrication."" He added: ""I amthe innocent victim of a drive-by shooting by a recklessdriver savagely aiming at the whole male gender.""(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)Betty Friedan's other books include ""It Changed My Life: Writings onthe Women's Movement"" (Random House, 1976); ""The Second Stage"" (Summit,1981); and ""The Fountain of Age"" (Simon & Schuster, 1993).The recipient of many awards and honorary degrees, she was avisiting professor at universities around the country, among them Columbia,Temple and the University of Southern California. In recent years,Friedan was associated with the Institute for Women and Workat Cornell University.Despite all of her later achievements, Friedan would be forever knownas the suburban housewife who started a revolution with ""TheFeminine Mystique."" Rarely has a single book been responsible forsuch sweeping, tumultuous and continuing social transformation.The new society Friedan proposed, founded on the notion that menand women were created equal, represented such a drastic upendingof the prevailing social norms that over the years tocome, she would be forced to explain her position againand again.""Some people think I'm saying, 'Women of the world unite --you have nothing to lose but your men,""' she toldLife magazine in 1963. ""It's not true. You have nothingto lose but your vacuum cleaners.""
","Betty Friedan was a brilliant, visionary woman who came to prominence in 1963 with publication of her book, The Feminine Mystique. The wildly popular book brought about a re-examination of women's role in society. Friedan found that many women were not content with lives of domesticity, and she campaigned for greater access to work outside the home. She was the first president of the National Organization for Women and a leader in the drive to pass the Equal Rights Amendment. She was abrasive, and some feminists criticized her for ignoring concerns of women of color, lesbians and the poor. ","In 1963 Betty Friedan wrote a provocative book, The Feminine Mystique, that ignited the feminist movement. The book exposed American women's discontent with domesticity and workplace discrimination. Friedan started an international movement. She founded and was elected president of NOW. She helped found the National Women's Political Caucus and a group that later became NARAL. For two decades she led demonstrations, protest marches, and news conferences. Her moderate belief that women should have equal rights but not at the expense of alienating men caused a split with other feminist leaders and her relegation to the sidelines in the late 1970's. ","Betty Friedan's 1963 controversial bestseller ""The Feminine Mystique"" made her the leading spokeswoman for a revitalized women's movement. Her pioneering book identified the unhappiness of post-WWII American women unfulfilled by traditional domesticity. She was an advocate of the Equal Rights Amendment and pushed for legal abortion. She helped found the National Organization for Women in 1966 and was its first president, splitting with them over their emphasis on lesbian issues and alienating men. She led the 1970 500,000-person Women's Strike for Equality. She was a founder of the Women's Political Caucus and NARAL. She wrote ""The Second Stage"" in 1981.

Frieden helped found the National Organization for Women in 1966 and was one of the founders of the National Women's Political Caucus. In 1970, she led a 500,000-person Women's Strike for Equality down Fifth Avenue. Friedan pushed for equal pay, sex-neutral help-wanted ads, maternity leave, child-care centers for working parents, and other topics considered radical at the time. "
D0918,D0918-B,"Betty Friedan, who championed the once-radical assertion that women needed morethan husbands and children to find fulfillment, was eulogized Monday as afeminist pioneer and loving mother _ if not always an easy one to livewith.""I truly believe that Betty Friedan was the most influential woman, not only ofthe 20th century but of the second millennium,"" said Muriel Fox, one of theco-founders with Friedan of the National Organization for Women.Colleagues from the American women's movement as well as her three children andtheir families were among more than 300 mourners at the funeral for Friedan, whodied of congestive heart failure Saturday on her 85th birthday.Friedan's son Jonathan remembered his mother hard at work writing ""The FeminineMystique"" _ the 1963 manifesto that shattered the cozy family ideal of theprosperous postwar era _ while her three children bounced around their New YorkCity apartment.""Betty was not the perfect mother,"" he said. ""Emily, Daniel and I ate TV dinnersgrowing up way beyond the recommended limit."" But when tens of thousands ofpeople cheered his mother at a rally when he was 17, ""my heart, despite itsadolescent shell, burst with pride.""Friedan's daughter, Dr. Emily Friedan, called her mother ""a mass ofcontradictions.""""She made so many connections and yet was exquisitely lonely,"" she said. ""Maybethe ultimate contradiction was that Betty just didn't fit into this world. Thatwas her curse, and yet she started a revolution.""Former Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman said she struggled to keep up withFriedan at women's rights marches because Friedan ""had enough energy for all ofus.""""Betty liberated our minds, and the gift of freedom is one of the most importantthings that we can have,"" Holtzman said.Several speakers remembered Friedan as a loving person who could also be feistyand difficult.""She was always very sweet and loving to me but when it came to other people shejust didn't take any (expletive) from anyone,"" said her 23-year-old grandson,Raphael Friedan. ""She was definitely the coolest grandmother that a young guylike me could ask for.""He recalled how his grandmother took him to Cuba and let him throw big partiesat her summer house in Sag Harbor on Long Island, near New YorkCity.Six of Friedan's nine grandchildren accompanied her plain wooden coffin out ofRiverside Memorial Chapel in Manhattan after the service. She was to be buriedin Sag Harbor.
It is still difficult for Taiwanese women tostrike a balance between their family lives and careers, the leadersof various Taiwanese women's groups said Tuesday.Paying tribute to the late pioneer of the modern U.S. feministmovement Betty Friedan, who died Feb. 4, the leaders said Friedan'sideals have had substantial impact on the women's movement in Taiwan,but it is still difficult to implement Friedan's later aspiration tohave women succeed with both family lives and careers.""Betty Friedan's most important heritage is her facilitation ofwomen's employment. However, the percentage of Taiwanese women inemployment is still low, even though the present 48 percent is arecord high, "" PWR Foundation Chairwoman Liu Yu-hsiu said. The PWRFoundation is Taiwan's leading women's group for promoting theemployment of women.""But U.S. liberal feminists like Friedan completely ignored thechildcare issue, assuming childcare to be the responsibility of theprivate individual. Taiwan also follows this model, and that makes itdifficult for mothers to seek employment,"" Liu added.Liu said that to encourage mothers to remain in employment, it isimportant that the government should provide comprehensive public andaffordable daycare service.DPP Legislator-at-large Huang Sue-ying, also a leading women'srights advocate, supported Liu's claim.""One major hurdle for mothers seeking jobs is the childcareissue. Whether the government provides a daycare support mechanismfor mothers at work is a decisive factor,"" Huang said.""Another major hurdle is certain groups' attempts to make mothersfeel guilty about leaving their babies. They have created themystique that babies have to be cared for by their mothers, "" sheclaimed.Huang pointed out that according to the latest Council of LaborAffairs figures, 67 percent of children under the age of three arecared for personally by their mothers, while over 20 percent areraised by relatives and only about 10 percent are put into daycareservices. She said this shows the inadequacy of daycare services inTaiwan and claimed that consequently, mothers are not confidentenough in these centers to leave their babies there.Garden of Hope Foundation CEO Chi Hui-jung said that even in herown organization, some female employees still choose to quit theirjobs and devote themselves completely to their children.The foundation is Taiwan's leading women's group focusing on theproblems of adolescent girls.""They would rather choose to spend all their time with theirchildren. Even if they want to work, they want something that ispart-time and close to their homes,"" Chi said.""It is probably because Taiwanese couples are giving birth tofewer children that mothers are willing to invest as much resourcesand time as possible in their little ones,"" she added.Chi said some other female employees may decide to take leave ofabsence to look after their babies for a year or two. Although thefoundation grants the leave, it offers no guarantee that their jobswill still be there when the employees want to return.There are also incidences of female employees refusing promotionsfor fear of work consuming too much of their family time, Chi said.""Although women can have day jobs now, they are still notrelieved of their family duties. Wives still spend more time doinghousework than their husbands. What I see is that women often pay ahigher price than their husbands to keep their jobs, "" Chi said.

History is a terrible thing to waste. The obituaries for BettyFriedan, whose 1963 book, ``The Feminine Mystique,'' revived anAmerican feminism then thought to be extinct and unnecessary, werestriking in their recognition of how much explanation is now requiredabout the world before the women's movement.Newspapers had to remind their readers that equal pay for equalwork, sex-blind help-wanted ads, the right of pregnant women to keeptheir jobs, nondiscriminatory admission standards for professionalschools and many other matters of simple justice were considered notonly controversial but radical proposals in the 1960s.Younger readers were doubtless as incredulous at this news as my23-year-old and 15-year-old nieces were when I recently told themabout the essay I was required to write by The Washington Post'spersonnel department as part of my application for a reporting job in1965. The topic, singularly inappropriate for a childless 19-year-old,was, ``How I Plan to Combine Motherhood With a Career.''On one level, the ignorance of the young and the not-so-young --many people in their 40s also know little about what life was likewhen most forms of discrimination against women were perfectly legal-- is a measure of how much has been accomplished. But on a deeperlevel, this ignorance endangers many feminist gains because it raisesthe real possibility that future generations will have to reinvent thewheel.It has happened before. The first wave of American feminism, whichbegan in 1848 with the Seneca Falls convention under the leadership ofLucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, was concerned with much morethan obtaining the vote for women. Economic equality, educationalequality and -- most controversial of all -- equality in religiousinstitutions that had long preached the divinely ordained inferiorityof women were part of the first feminist platform. As the century woreon, though, the more radical voices were stilled and the movementconcentrated solely on suffrage.Stanton, whose ``The Woman's Bible'' created as much of a sensationand a scandal in 1892 as Friedan's book did 71 years later, waswritten out (literally) of the women's movement because of herunorthodox views on religion. Her name did not return to history untilthe 1980s, with the research of a new generation of feminist scholars.Friedan was the first 20th century feminist to restore thehistorical and cultural context lost for most of the century and tomake the essential point that, if an entire group has a problem, thesolution can never be purely personal.I have always been grateful that I read ``The Feminine Mystique''shortly before I went to Washington to interview with the Post. Beforereading Friedan, I truly believed that barriers to women in journalismwould not apply to me because all of those other women must have donesomething wrong to be stuck in what used to be called the ``societysection.'' Without the perspective provided by Friedan, I might havebeen surprised by the personnel director's insulting demand, lost mytemper and lost the chance at a job. As it was, I bit my tongue, wrotethe essay and told myself that I would become one of the women whowould challenge the prejudices that denigrated all women.Friedan's message about the cultural nature of women'ssubordination was not well received initially. In the New York TimesBook Review in 1963, Lucy Freeman scolded Friedan for criticizingwomen's magazines and asked, ``What is to stop a woman who isinterested in national and international affairs from readingmagazines that deal with those subjects? To paraphrase a famous line,`The fault, dear Mrs. Friedan, is not in our culture, but inourselves.' ''At Freidan's funeral in New York on Monday, her longtime friend,sociologist Amitai Etzioni, noted that his department at ColumbiaUniversity did not have a single female professor in 1962. The fewBarnard female students admitted to Columbia classes, Etzioniacknowledged honestly, knew that they were there on sufferance and``knew that they should not be heard too often.''This entire history is in urgent need of retelling today, at a timewhen other legacies of the movement -- most notably legal abortion --are under assault. Historical amnesia, not the fundamentalistChristian right, is the true villain. Millions of young women and mentoday simply cannot imagine what life was like before Roe vs. Wade anymore than they can imagine what it was like to be told ``No Women NeedApply'' at the door to graduate-school classrooms.The obligation to retell the truth belongs to my generation, youngenough to have reaped the benefits of the revolution begun by womennow in their 70s and 80s. It is our moral duty to ensure that thehistory of our women's movement, unlike the history of 19th centuryfeminism, does not perish from the consciousness of the nextgeneration.
Betty Friedan had a thing about floor care. Moppingthe linoleum, scrubbing the bathroom tile, vacuuming a mere twiceweekly -- this humdrum trope runs through ``The Feminine Mystique''with the insistent drone of a ``new electric waxer over the spotlesskitchen floor.'' The relentless but unsatisfying demands of thecrumb-free floor encapsulated Friedan's famous ``problem that has noname,'' the unspoken sense of dissatisfaction churning in the kitchensof America and the minds of American women in the mid-20th century. AsFriedan summed it up, ``What kind of woman was she if she did not feelthis mysterious fulfillment waxing the kitchen floor?''To which, on picking up ``The Feminine Mystique'' four decadeslater, my initial response was: You're supposed to wax the floor?I write this not to belittle Friedan's metaphor but rather to revelin its obsolescence. For to reread the ``The Feminine Mystique,'' as Idid after Friedan's death last weekend, is to be reminded of thetransformation of American women -- indeed, American society -- in the43 years since the publication of her then-shocking manifesto. Therehave been remarkable advances, and not just in the technology ofno-wax floors.This change -- the long way that women have, in fact, come -- is easyto forget, in part because we are still picking our way unsteadilyalong the path that Friedan helped cut, still enmeshed inwork-vs.-family debates that are at once stale and impassioned.Women -- at least those with the luxury of choice -- agonizeendlessly over part-time vs. full-time vs. staying at home; whateveroption we select, we tend to second-guess the decision. We search forthe elusive holy grail of work-life balance -- off-ramps and on-rampsand flextime and job-sharing. We alternate between acceptance anddespair at the still-inequitable allocation of family tasks. We have aseat, more often, at the table, but are surprised, too often, to lookup and find no other women there. We choose the mommy track but lamentthe glass ceiling.All of which is to say: The role of women in the America of 2006 iscomplicated and messy and not apt to be resolved anytime soon, if atall. The more pertinent question, though, is: Compared to what? I canargue that the glass now is half-empty or half-full, and I've doneboth, depending mostly on how smoothly things are running in ourchaotic, grimy-floored household. But reentering the world of ``TheFeminine Mystique'' is an oddly comforting exercise in time travel.In the long-gone world depicted by Friedan, the life of theAmerican woman is a cruelly binary one: The women she describes feelforced to choose between work and home; their failure to be fullycontented with the latter is taken as evidence of neurosis, or worse.``Each suburban wife struggled with it alone,'' Friedan writes inher opening paragraph. ``As she made the beds, shopped for groceries,matched slipcover material, ate peanut butter sandwiches with herchildren, chauffeured Cub Scouts and Brownies, lay beside her husbandat night -- she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question --'Is this all?' '' And there is no contrary role model. ``I never knewa woman, when I was growing up,'' Friedan writes, ``who used her mind,played her own part in the world, and also loved, and had children.''Friedan's diagnosis is characteristically, even offensively,overblown: She compares housewives resigned to their suburbanimprisonment to inmates in ``their comfortable concentration camps.''The feminine mystique, she says, ``has succeeded in burying millionsof American women alive.''Yet her prescription for these women is remarkably un-strident,even balanced. ``Marriage and motherhood are an essential part oflife, but not the whole of it,'' she writes. Women ``need to create anew life plan, fitting in the love and children and home that havedefined femininity in the past with the work toward a greater purposethat shapes the future.'' Friedan understood, as many of her moreradical successors did not, that work without family could feel asempty as the converse.I remember, not so long after ``The Feminine Mystique'' waspublished -- and before, probably, I had even a bra to burn --announcing definitively to my mother that I would not be havingchildren. My intention, I'm sure, was mostly to shock her; I suspectedeven then that my preteen certitude might not last. But my declarationderived in part from the prevailing mind-set that family was merely anannoying impediment to anyone who wanted to do Serious Work.Now that I am, thankfully, the mother I vowed I would never be, Iwatch my children -- two daughters -- and wonder how they will managethese tensions. And I find myself these days feeling oddly hopeful. Atdinner the other day, my fifth-grader eagerly described the bottlerocket she was making in science class. As it happened, her group ofthree was all girls; one's mother a research scientist, the other's apartner in a major law firm. They had decorated their rocket, mydaughter said, with neon pink duct tape and named it ``Feminism.''Somehow, I think, Betty Friedan would have been pleased.
Those of us who came of age with the feminist movement wanted to bea Gloria Steinem kind of feminist. Not a Betty Friedan kind offeminist.We were not the restless suburban housewives for whom the frumpy,doughy Friedan spoke. We were not the woman who suffered ``a nameless,aching dissatisfaction'' with her life of chores and children.Instead, we were young careerists like the sleek and husky-voicedSteinem, who had the physical qualifications to make her journalisticmark in a Playboy bunny costume.We believed Steinem when she said, ``A woman needs a man like afish needs a bicycle.'' Friedan was trying to make peace with thatbicycle for the sake of the kids. We didn't think we'd ever have any.It was that generational split -- between our mothers, for whomFriedan spoke, and ourselves, who wanted to emulate Steinem'sandrogynous independence -- that cost Friedan her rightful place atthe head of the table of the feminist movement.Only now, at her death Saturday at 85, do we acknowledge what shemeant to all of us.Friedan was that housewife, bored near to madness after giving upher career -- some accounts say she was fired when she got pregnant asecond time -- to stay at home and take care of the household whileher husband worked.But she didn't have words for the frustration she felt until shesurveyed her fellow Smith College graduates in advance of a reunionand found that the ones at home with the kids were feeling the sameennui. Steinem might have called that networking.``The Feminine Mystique,'' the book that resulted from that surveyand many more confirming interviews with wives and mothers, was notthe shot heard 'round the world that legend would have us believe.Published in 1963 in only modest numbers, it did not hit the heart ofthe American home until it came out as a Dell paperback a year later.I have this vision of stay-at-home mothers passing this dog-earedpaperback around the playground, the pool and the schoolyard until arevolution quietly bubbled up from a million ``a-ha'' moments.Friedan described the vague dissatisfaction of these women whilethe feminists that followed radicalized the remedy. Friedan's firstcause was the unification of the help-wanted ads, which had beenseparated by gender. By the time we college women got hold of thefeminist movement, we assumed we would work at any job we wanted. Menand children, optional.``Some people think I'm saying `Women of the world unite -- youhave nothing to lose but your men,' '' Friedan told Life magazine in1963. ``It's not true. You have nothing to lose but your vacuumcleaners.''The irony, of course, is that 30 years later many of Steinem'sacolytes are the reincarnation of Friedan's mad housewife. Somewherealong the line, we got married and we had kids and we patched togethersome compromise between work and home that our husbands never had tomake. We are half-nuts, too. But this time our problem has a name. Itis called ``having it all.''It seems like only a moment ago that we sat inconsciousness-raising groups, drafting the script for a new worldorder that would have no gender boundaries. But it was a scriptwithout a back story. We never called home to ask how our mothers hadmanaged. We didn't think they had anything to teach us. We justrepudiated their choices with our own.The feminist movement would split over the issues in the kind ofdegrading internecine war that diminishes all movements, and Friedanwas kicked to the curb. She resigned as the first president of theNational Organization for Women just a few years after founding it ona cocktail napkin. Younger feminists thought she had paid too muchattention to the concerns of white, middle-class married women insteadof to those of minorities, poor women and lesbians.It is Friedan's mixed legacy that the issues that mattered most toher are still on the table today: paid maternity leave, affordablechild care, job training for women with children, reproductiveself-determination.The issues that the college feminists dismissed as bourgeois arethe issues that continue to matter most to women today.It took us all these years to realize that Friedan was more thanthe mother of the movement. She was the mother of us all.
Betty Friedan, rest in peace. You helped spark a revolution ofthought that galvanized a nation of women to reject the1950s cookie-cutter lifestyle that revolved around being wife, mother, housekeeperand cook.It's hard to imagine women living a prefabricated life, tucked amidcul-de-sacs in mass-produced homes in leafy suburbs -- the kindof lifestyle you railed against.The woman who headed my family then never knew such aworld.While middle- and upper-middle-class women, most of them white, related to""The Feminine Mystique"" -- Friedan's 1963 critique of domesticity --my mom was struggling to save her marriage while workingas a seamstress and raising two children.No. 3 (me) came along later. Six years after I wasborn, Mom and Dad divorced, meaning she was not onlymom, cook, housekeeper and breadwinner, she'd also take up theslack as dad.This was the reality of single mothers in my 'hood, whodidn't have the luxury of time to fret about alife interrupted. They gladly would have traded places with educatedwomen of privilege who felt trapped in their suburban world.Women of my generation only know what we've read about thosechanging times and what our moms have told us.Back then, my mom was encouraged to go to ""secretarial school""while women like Friedan graduated from elite colleges only tobe ushered to a life serving her husband and children.Which is worse: having little hope, or having hopes raised, thencrushed?Even though poor women of my mother's generation could not relateto women like Friedan, they would benefit from the trickle-downeffect the women's movement had.Taking college courses at night, my mom earned a bachelor's degreein the early '80s. Professors encouraged her to pursue amaster's degree.Friedan, who died Saturday at age 85, helped empower women tofight for parity with men: equal jobs, equal pay andequal respect.Those heading the movement did not clamor for poor women tohave access to college grants, job training and day care.Though most single mothers living in poverty didn't directly benefitfrom the women's movement, many of their daughters have. Thatis, if they had a combination of strong mentors, luckand will.The gains for women overall have been tremendous, and it happenedbecause women like Friedan were stoking the flames of action,getting women organized and demanding change.Still, we have a long way to go, baby.There are eight female CEOs heading up Fortune 500 companies. Womenown fewer than 30 percent of nonfarm businesses in theU.S., according to a January report by the U.S. CensusBureau. Yet, women-owned businesses are growing at twice the rateof the national average.Women account for 20 percent of college presidents. Yet, at 56percent of the college undergraduate population, women outnumber men incollege.Our societal views have changed too. Most men don't expect tomarry a woman who will stay home and play therole of housekeeper, mother and cook -- not that there'sanything wrong with it if it's the woman's choice.Over lunch last week, an acquaintance told me she and herhusband didn't plan to have children. Just like that. Nowhispering. No guilt.That's the gift Friedan gave women. Our worth isn't determined byour marital status. Divorced women are no longer viewed asused goods. Single women who have passed age 35 areno longer spinsters. It's freeing.But there are some things that are hard to liberate ourselvesof: Middle-class single women may be independent and career-minded, butthey still have to do their own laundry.(Contact Denver Post columnist Cindy Rodríguez at crodriguezdenverpost.com.)
Today should not pass without recalling the impact of Betty Friedanand the profound changes triggered by her incisive appeal forwomen to reject the ""contented"" homemaker role of the 1950sand insist on fuller participation in American life.Anyone younger than 45 will find it hard to believe thatscarcely a generation ago middle-class women did not aspire tocareers outside of teacher, nurse or secretary; that girls didnot play school sports; that raising kids and pleasing menwere considered to be a respectable woman's highest and onlycallings.The second wave of American feminism surely would have happened withoutFriedan, who died over the weekend on her 85th birthday.But her book ""The Feminine Mystique"" hit with explosive forcein 1963 and quickened the women's movement. Drawing from herown unhappy Midwestern childhood, Friedan gave voice to ""a strangestirring, a sense of dissatisfaction, a yearning that ... eachsuburban wife struggled with ... alone. As she made thebeds, shopped for groceries, matched slipcover material, ate peanut buttersandwiches with her children, chauffeured Cub Scouts and Brownies, laybeside her husband at night -- she was afraid toask even of herself the silent question -- 'Is thisall?' ""Within two decades, the American culture and economy had been transformed.The entry of women into the workforce affected nearly everything-- from fast food to freeway traffic, from marriage tohome design, from education to the deepening divides in politicsand religion over topics like abortion and ""family values.""Although Friedan founded prominent women's rights organizations, led marches and wasfamously cantankerous, she was a moderate in the movement, oncejoking that it wasn't men that woman should reject, butvacuum cleaners. Indeed, the mainstream values of nurture, home andfamilial love were the foundation of her authority: She believedthat women should have equal rights, but not at theexpense of alienating men. Real love, she thought, could nothappen among unequals. For that she was dismissed as ""bourgeois""and pushed to the margins. In 1991 Susan Faludi accusedher of ""yanking out the stitches in her own handiwork.""But perhaps because Friedan did not overreach, her appeals to justiceand common sense were more effective in transforming the livesand prospects of American women. If you have a daughter,you should today whisper a silent thanks for Betty Friedan'slife and work.Minneapolis Star Tribune editorial
Cox News Service DAYTON, Ohio -- In 1962, when she wassix months' pregnant with her first child, Judy Mott waslaid off from her job with Sears. ""It's against storepolicy,"" her bosses told her curtly.customers.With her husband in college, Mott was the family's primary breadwinner.But she knew it wouldn't do any good to protest.She couldn't have known she was only a year away froman event that would change everything: The publication of BettyFriedan's ""The Feminine Mystique.""Mott wondered if today's young women even know of Friedan's existence,let alone what a difference she made in their lives.Last year, her granddaughter, Jennifer Mott, a junior at CentervilleHigh School, wrote an insightful essay about Friedan's importance tothe feminist movement. ""It blew me away,"" said Mott, communitydevelopment manager for Montgomery County.Adds Jennifer: ""I wouldn't have the choices that I have todayif it weren't for the courage of women like BettyFriedan.""The New York Times concurred in its front-page article Monday aboutFriedan's death at 85, noting that her ""searing first book,""The Feminine Mystique,"" ignited the contemporary women's movement in 1963and as a result permanently transformed the social fabric ofthe United States and countries around the world.""For a woman who created such a dramatic change in oursociety, Friedan's death caused remarkably little stir. I winced atthe news reports that misspelled her last name as ""Freidan.""Jennifer Mott acknowledges that few of her peers have heard ofFriedan. ""When I was doing my paper it really stuckout to me that she's one of the reasons Ican have goals, go to college, and major in somethingmeaningful to me,"" she said. ""She grew up at atime when it was considered the natural goal for womento be a wife and drive the kids to BoyScouts and Girl Scouts and not to have any underlyingdesires. She respected motherhood, but wanted women to know itwas OK to want something more.""Why was her death accorded little of the reverence shown thisweek at the passing of another giant, Coretta Scott King?A partial explanation is that feminism remains a movement that getslittle respect. It's more likely the butt of a jokeor a Rush Limbaugh rant about ""feminazis."" Sometimes people willtell you they believe in equal rights for women buthasten to add, ""I'm not a feminist,"" as if there'sno correlation between the two concepts.But part of the reason for Friedan's relative obscurity is thevery success of her movement. ""In later years,"" The Timesarticle noted, ""some feminists dismissed Ms. Friedan's work as outmoded.""It's hard to imagine, today, a world in which companies routinelyfired women for being pregnant. Jennifer Mott had never heardthe story about how her grandmother lost her job atSears when she was pregnant with Jennifer's father, Norb Mott.But she'll never forget her grandmother's constant words of encouragement: ""Youcan do anything you want to do.""It's a lesson she learned from Betty Friedan.Mary McCarty writes for the Dayton Daily News.

ON FRIEDAN, A FEMINIST CRITIQUE(BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In The Guardian, Germaine Greer took critical measureof a fellow feminist, Betty Friedan, the author of ""TheFeminine Mystique,"" who died on Feb. 4 at 85. (ENDITALICS HERE)In its time, ""The Feminine Mystique"" was a book that spoketo American women loud and clear. It was based ona questionnaire Betty sent out to the women who wereat college with her in the 1950s, all ""happily"" marriedand bringing up kids in the suburbs. Betty, who wasin the same boat, was feeling restless and dissatisfied. Toher immense relief and considerable surprise, she found that justabout all the women in the same situation who repliedto her questionnaire were feeling the same. Betty was notone to realize that she was being lifted on anexisting wave; she thought she was the wave, that shehad actually created the Zeitgeist that was ready and hungryfor her book.PANNING FOR TERRORISTS(BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In ""Of Wiretaps, Google Searches and Handguns,"" onABCNews.com, the mathematician John Allen Paulos took a statistical lookat government electronic surveillance, arguing that widespread wiretapping programs produceso much information that it is essentially impossible to followup on the leads generated. (END ITALICS HERE)Even if an accurate profile of potential terrorists is drawn, thefact that such a vanishingly small percentage of us areterrorists means that the vast majority of the people investigatedwill be innocent. Even if the probability that the purportedterrorist profile is accurate were an astonishing 99 percent (ifsomeone has terrorist ties, the profile will pick him orher out 99 percent of the time, and, for easeof computation, if someone does not have such ties, theprofile will pick him or her out only 1 percentof the time), most of the hits would be falsepositives.For illustration, let's further assume that one out of a millionAmerican residents has terrorist ties -- that's approximately 300 people-- and the profile will pick out 99 percent, or297 of them. Great. But what of the approximately 300million innocent Americans? The profile will also pick out 1percent of them, ""only"" 3 million.YOUR BRAIN ON SUPER BOWL ADS(BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Edge.com has an article titled ""Who Really Wonthe Super Bowl?"" by Dr. Marco Iacoboni, a neuroscientist atthe UCLA Ahmanson-Lovelace Brain Mapping Center. Iacoboni and his colleaguesused fast magnetic resonance imaging technology to observe brain responsesto commercials shown during the Super Bowl. (END ITALICS HERE)The overwhelming winner among the Super Bowl ads is the Disney-NFL""I am going to Disney"" ad. The Disney ad elicitedstrong responses in orbito-frontal cortex and ventral striatum, two brainregions associated with processing of rewards. Also, the Disney adinduced robust responses in mirror neuron areas, indicating identification andempathy. Further, the circuit for cognitive control, encompassing anterior cingulatecortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, was highly active while watchingthe Disney ad.The three biggest flops seem to be the Burger King ad,the FedEx ad and the GoDaddy ad. Three quite interestingfeatures that come out of this instant study are thefollowing: first, people -- when interviewed -- tend to saywhat they are expected to say, but their brain seemsto say the opposite. For instance, female subjects may giveverbally very low ""grades"" to ads using actresses in sexyroles, but their mirror neuron areas seem to fire upquite a bit, suggesting some form of identification and empathy.Second, we saw strong habituation effects, such that the secondtime around the commercial induces much weaker responses. Third --and this is probably interesting to neuroscientists -- among brainregions associated with complex social behavior, we observed a mixof activation and de-activation.
","The feminist movement split, and Betty Friedan, who helped to start it, was sidelined. She resigned as the first president of the National Organization for Women after only a few years, as other women radicalized the movement. When she died at age 85 in 2006, newspapers had to remind readers that before Betty Friedan and the work of the movement she helped to start, equal pay for equal work, sex-blind help-wanted ads, the right of pregnant women to keep their jobs, non-discriminatory admissions standards for professional schools and many other matters were considered not only controversial, but radical proposals. ","Betty Friedan helped to empower women to fight for parity with men in the workplace, equal jobs, pay and respect. She encouraged them to reject the ""contented homemaker"" role and demand fuller participation in life. Some considered her the most influential woman of the second millennium. She raised issues such as paid maternity leave, affordable childcare, job training for women and reproductive self determination, which were radical in the 1960's but are still important today. Some feminists felt she focused too much on the concerns of white middle class married women instead of all women. ","Friedan's first cause was unification of help-wanted ads separated by gender. She empowered women to fight for parity with men. She started a revolution, getting women organized and demanding change. Drawing on her own unhappy Midwestern childhood, she voiced the dissatisfaction suburban wives struggled with alone. Friedan made the point that if an entire group has a problem, the solution can't be purely personal. She compared housewives resigned to their situation to inmates in comfortable concentration camps. Friedan was a moderate in the women's rights movement, believing women should have equal rights but not at the expense of alienating men. ","Betty Friedan's ""The Feminine Mystique"" triggered profound changes in American life, changes so basic that most people today find it hard to believe that when the book was published a woman's role was to get married, raise children, keep a clean house, and please her husband; the only careers ""acceptable"" for women were nursing and teaching; and girls did not compete in sports. The entry of women into the workforce permanently changed the culture and economy, not only in America, but around the world. "
D0919,D0919-A,"Prince Charles is to marry his partner Camilla Parker Bowles, the prince'soffice said Thursday.Clarence House didn't immediately announce further details, but Sky News TVreported that the heir to the throne would marry on April 6.Charles was previously married to Princess Diana, who died in a car crash inParis in 1997. She was divorced from Charles when she died.Charles dated Camilla many years before he married Diana in 1981. They remainedfriends but Diana blamed Charles' relationship with Parker Bowles, who was alsomarried, for the failure of their union.""There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded,"" Diana saidin a 1995 TV interview.In 1994, Prince Charles admitted in a TV documentary that he had strayed fromhis marriage vows, but insisted the infidelity happened only after the marriagewas ""irretrievably broken down, us both having tried.""The pair divorced in 1996.The marriage is a sensitive issue because Parker Bowles is divorced and herformer husband is still alive. Charles would be the supreme governor of theChurch of England if he took the throne, and some Anglicans remain opposed toremarriage of divorcees.The church is officially neutral on the issue, but former Archbishop ofCanterbury George Carey recently urged the couple to marry.Last year, a poll indicated that more Britons support Prince Charles marryingCamilla Parker Bowles than oppose it. Thirty-two percent of respondents to thePopulus poll said they would support Charles if he remarried, while 29 percentwere opposed. Thirty-eight percent said they didn't care and 2 percent had noopinion.

Many Britons welcomed Prince Charles' surprise announcement that he would marryhis lover Camilla Parker Bowles, but some said she never will win their heartsthe way Princess Diana did.Within minutes of Charles' announcement that the couple will marry at WindsorCastle on April 8, it was hard to find anyone on the streets of central Londonwho hadn't heard the news.""We've all been expecting that sooner or later, said Dina Pine, 73, a retiredrestaurant owner. ""But I don't think she should be queen.""""I'm fine with him marrying her.

""Charles seemsto have his head screwed on,"" she said.Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, and other well-known British publicfigures, said it's time for the public to forget about royal tragedies of thepast and welcome Camilla into the fold.Ferguson, who is divorced from Prince Andrew, Charles' brother, said through aspokeswoman in the United States that she ""is very happy for"" for the engagedcouple.Winston Churchill, the grandson of Britain's wartime prime minister of the samename, said the couple are entitled to be happy together.""They are clearly very much in love.

They are entitled to have their own happiness the same as everyoneelse,"" Churchill told Sky News.Asked how he thought the British public would react, veteran broadcaster SirDavid Frost said: ""I think there will be quite a bit of controversy for 24hours, but then I think everyone will be happy and feel that Prince Charlesdeserves his happiness.""Charles and Camilla _ divorcees and longtime lovers _ will marry in a civilceremony, not in the Church of England, and that Parker Bowles will be calledHer Royal Highness the Duchess of Cornwall after the marriage, and called theprincess consort, not the queen, when Charles becomes king.Grocer Phillip Way, 37, said he believes royals such as Prince Charles oftenearn too much money from their many estates. But Way said he doesn't care whoCharles marries.""We could have Queen Camilla or the Queen of Sheba, and it would make nodifference to me,"" he said with a laugh. ""Who do you think the best man is goingto be?""Chris Morris, 54, a building engineer, said that he thought Charles was smart tomarry Camilla before becoming king. But whatever happens, Morris said, she willnever be as popular as Princess Diana was.""Diana is still in so many people's hearts,"" he said. ""Queen Camilla wouldn't beso popular.""Charles divorced Diana in 1996, a year before she was killed in a Paris carcrash, and some Britons believe the long-standing Charles-Camilla affair was themain reason the Charles-Diana marriage fell apart.Joe Stolerman, 17, a student, said that if Camilla ever becomes queen ""I'm sureshe won't be well received.""Paul Curley, an IT manager, 33, said he doesn't care about the royal family,adding that ""they are more for tourists than for us.""

He didn't really want tomarry her because he already had this relationship with Camilla. That is how Isee it,"" said Rogers, 60.
She may not become queen, but Camilla Parker Bowles will be bona fide royaltybecause of three key letters: HRH.That designation stands for Her Royal Highness and is highly prized because itmeans the bearer is officially a member of the inner sanctum of the royalfamily.When she weds Charles, Parker Bowles will acquire a slew of titles _ the mainone being HRH Duchess of Cornwall. In Scotland, she will be the Duchess ofRothesay.However, she will not be known as the Princess of Wales, a title which for manypeople worldwide still conjures up memories of the prince's popular first wife,the late Diana.If Charles eventually becomes king, Parker Bowles will be known as HRH PrincessConsort _ but not Queen Camilla.That decision was made by the couple themselves, Charles's Clarence House officesaid, and was not imposed on them because of Parker Bowles' divorceestatus.Princess Diana lost her HRH status when she was divorced _ a point that rankledgreatly with her and was criticized both by the public and thepress.In 1936, when King Edward VIII abdicated to marry the American divorcee WallisSimpson and they became the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, he is said to have beendeeply angry and hurt that the HRH was withheld from his wife.As the royal family modernizes, there are likely to be fewerHRHs.Charles' younger brother, Prince Edward, announced in 2003 that his newborndaughter would not receive the HRH, nor would any more children he and his wife,Sophie, might have.Every wife of a reigning king has been known as Queen Consort except Queen MaryII who was joint sovereign with King William III. She was Queen in her own rightand together they reigned from 1689 to 1694.
So ends years of tabloid and taxicab speculation.In a surprise announcement, Britain's heir to the throne, PrinceCharles, declared on Thursday that he will marry his lover, CamillaParker Bowles, in a spring ceremony at Windsor Castle.Parker Bowles will never become Queen Camilla, nor will she takeover the title of princess of Wales that was bestowed on herpredecessor, Diana, whose marriage to Charles ended in divorce, partlyover her. Diana died a year later, along with her boyfriend, in aParis car accident.Instead, in a sort of constitutional compromise, Parker Bowles, 57,will receive the title her royal highness the duchess of Cornwall. IfCharles becomes king, she will be called her royal highness theprincess consort. ``Those are the only royal titles that have beenconfirmed so far,'' said a spokesperson for the prince of Wales.Britain, which in 1936 forced Charles' great-uncle to abdicate thethrone in order to marry an American divorcee, barely batted aneyelash at the consequence of the impending nuptials.Prime Minister Tony Blair wished the couple ``every happiness'' onbehalf of himself and his Cabinet. Archbishop of Canterbury RowanWilliams, who serves as spiritual leader of the Anglican Church, said,``I am pleased that Prince Charles and Mrs. Camilla Parker Bowles havedecided to take this important step.''The announcement came in the form of a brief, formal statement fromthe prince's household, which read, ``It is with great pleasure thatthe marriage of HRH the prince of Wales and Mrs. Camilla Parker Bowlesis announced. It will take place on Friday 8th April, 2005, at WindsorCastle.''Later, Charles issued a statement that said, ``Mrs. Parker Bowlesand I are absolutely delighted. It will be a very special day for usand our families.''Queen Elizabeth gave the union her royal blessing. ``The duke ofEdinburgh and I are very happy that the prince of Wales and Mrs.Parker Bowles are to marry. We have given them our warmest good wishesfor their future together.''The 56-year-old prince's two sons, Prince Edward and Prince Harry,announced that they too were delighted at the news of their father'smarriage.Although the marriage will cause little politicalrepercussion around Britain, the news dominated the airwaves Thursday.Discussions and surveys showed general acceptance of the marriage butstrong reservations about Charles' new wife becoming ``QueenCamilla.''The memory of Diana, mother of his two sons, is still strong amongthe British public, for whom Parker Bowles is the spoiler of whatbegan as a fairy-tale marriage.Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, a onetime nursery school teacher,were wed in 1981. Their marriage was made in tabloid heaven, theirevery move scrutinized and documented in pictures by eager paparazzi.But it was also marked by widespread speculation about unhappiness andby questions of infidelity.In 1993, the tabloid press published a transcript of a taped callbetween Charles and Parker Bowles, then the wife of a Britishbrigadier general. Among the lovers' words was a wish by the princethat he become a tampon in order to remain close to Camilla.Charles' relationship with Camilla began about 35 years ago whenthey met at a polo match on the grounds of Windsor Castle. Theycontinued seeing each other throughout Charles' tumultuous marriage toDiana, and the relationship was said by Diana to be the cause of hereventual breakup with the prince. ``There were three of us in thismarriage -- so it was a bit crowded,'' she said in a famous TVinterview.(Begin optional trim)From the beginning, it was clear Parker Bowles shared Charles'sporting life more than Diana.Since the early days of his marriage to Diana, Charles was clearlymore at home on the back of a horse or shooting grouse and fishing forsalmon than on a dance floor, listening to pop music or watchingballet, which were among the favorite pastimes of his young bride.Charles and Parker Bowles were often seen fox hunting together oron the polo field, where Charles was a regular player. Many of theirpublic outings have been on horseback.Charles and Diana divorced in 1996. Diana, as princess of Wales,found her calling as a patron of myriad charities, particularly thosesupporting sick and disadvantaged children and old people. Shechampioned AIDS victims and traveled to war-torn and poverty strickencountries, visiting orphanages and hospitals.Her death in a car accident in Paris in August 1997, along withboyfriend Dodi Fayed, provoked an outpouring of grief in Britain andabroad, forcing Charles and Parker Bowles to keep their relationshipin the background for some time.Gradually the couple began appearing together in public incarefully choreographed events.  (End optional trim)The decision to marry comes as what many see as a logicalconclusion to a difficult situation.``I don't think the public is hostile to the remarriage,'' saysSarah Richardson , a constitutional historian at Warwick University.``What does surprise me is the recognition of her role as princessconsort, which will put her in a spotlight where she will have todeliver and be an active supporter of Charles almost on a par withDiana.''Relief rather than pleasure was expressed by many Britonsinterviewed Thursday by TV networks.``I guess it was better that they got married rather than not,''said Marianne McElwee, 24, a Web site manager.``I'm not keen on her,'' McElwee added. ``After all, Charles wasalways in a relationship with her before he met Diana and he went onseeing her after that, which didn't make Diana very happy.''Although the acceptance of a king-to-be, himself divorced, with adivorcee wife, is indicative of the changing face of Britain, theannouncement also forces official recognition of the flawed and humanside of royalty.Royal marriages must be approved on several levels, so Blair'sstatement of approval was essential. Charles' marriage will also needan Act of Parliament before the wedding day -- virtually a foregoneconclusion in this case.(Optional add end)The spring wedding will be a civil service followed by a service ofprayer and dedication in the chapel of St. George at Windsor Castle.No details were disclosed Thursday other than that the archbishop hadagreed to celebrate the religious ceremony.The couple will spend their honeymoon in Scotland on the royalestate of Birkhall, where Charles is said often to have taken refugefrom the public and media glare.On Thursday evening, the couple attended a gala dinner at WindsorCastle to support one of Prince Charles's charities.Attention was focused on the prince's bride-to-be wearing herengagement ring for the first time -- a diamond and platinum heirloomreportedly from the prince's grandmother, the queen mother, who was101 years old when she died in 2002.The smiling Camilla, dressed in a glittering red floor-length dressand a double string of pearls, told waiting crowds that the prince hadproposed to her on bended knee. ``I'm just coming down to earth,'' shesaid, flashing the ring for photographers.Charles, garbed in a tuxedo with a red collar and cuffs, told theassembled reporters, ``I am very happy.''The couple were applauded by their guests and posed, grinningbroadly, in front of the press before joining the party.
They have been friends for 30 years and loversfor most of that time. They have survived marriages toand divorces from other people; the icy disapproval of relatives;the resentment of the public; and, perhaps most excruciating ofall, the publication of intimate details of their risque pillowtalk.But now Charles, the Prince of Wales, and Camilla Parker Bowles,whose love affair is said to have begun when shecheekily declared, ""My great-grandmother was your great-great-grandfather's mistress, so howabout it?,"" are to take the most radical and surprisingstep of their long, star-crossed romance. They are getting married.The wedding is to take place on April 8 in acivil ceremony at Windsor Castle, Charles announced Thursday, but the57-year-old bride will not become the Princess of Wales --that position having already been more than filled by theprince's late and much-remembered ex-wife, Diana. Instead, Parker Bowles willbe known as Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cornwall.Nor will she be crowned queen. In a move that addressesone of the thorniest issues surrounding the marriage, Parker Bowleswill become the Princess Consort if Charles, 56, succeeds hismother on the throne. It will be the first timein the history of the English monarchy that such atitle has been used, according to Vernon Bogdanor, professor ofpolitics at Oxford University, and the first time an Englishking's wife has not been queen. (Queen Victoria did haveAlbert as Prince Consort.)The announcement gives official status for the first time to ParkerBowles, who has been living in an uneasy purgatory --part of the prince's life, but bound by royal customand social protocol to be an unequal partner. Although inrecent years the two have appeared more often together inpublic, their murky status has put her in a difficultand oddly anachronistic position.In earlier eras, of course, royals were not allowed to marrydivorced people (never mind, unless they were Henry VIII, beingdivorced themselves). In 1936, Edward VIII renounced the throne ratherthan give up Wallis Simpson, an American divorcee. In 1955,Prince Charles' Aunt, Princess Margaret, broke off a relationship witha divorced man rather than relinquish her royal status andall its perks.But in a sign of how much things have changed, thistime Queen Elizabeth gave her permission for, and blessing to,the engagement of her divorced son to his divorced lover.Saying that she and her husband, Charles' father, were ""veryhappy,"" she ordered that the Round Tower at Windsor Castlebe lit in celebration.The queen has not always appeared to be Parker Bowles' biggestfan. Although Charles has for some time been openly livingwith Camilla, his mother has very rarely entertained the twoof them as a couple and indeed seemed intent ondistancing herself from the relationship. But the two met in2000, and on Thursday the Queen said that ""we havegiven them our warmest good wishes for their future together.""In their own statement, the prince's two sons, Prince Harry andPrince William, said: ""We are both very happy for ourfather and Camilla and we wish them all the luckin the future.""While the majority of respondents in several snap public opinion pollsin Britain on Thursday said they disapproved of the engagement,crowds of well-wishers cheered Prince Charles during a public appearancein London, and politicians rushed to congratulate the couple.Even officials of the Church of England, which until 2002 didnot even allow divorcees to marry in church, have comearound to the idea that Charles and Camilla would bebetter off married than not. The question has been complicatedby the fact that when he becomes king, Charles willalso become supreme governor of the church.The Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, said he was pleased atCharles and Camilla's decision ""to take this important step."" Afterthe civil wedding ceremony, he has agreed to lead aservice ""of prayer and dedication"" at St. George's Chapel inWindsor.In a world of expendable relationships, where middle-aged men trade inmiddle-aged women for younger, firmer models as easily as theymight dispose of a creaky toaster or last year's car,the enduring relationship of Charles and Camilla, as the newspaperscall them, carries a sweet poignancy for many.Although in recent years she has had something of an imagemakeover, appearing more in couture dresses and less in frumpycountrywoman garb, Parker Bowles can hardly be called glamorous anddoes not appear to care. She once called herself ""yourdevoted old bag"" in a love letter to Prince Charles.Even those unable to forgive Charles for cheating on the latePrincess of Wales can take a certain comfort in knowingthat if he had to do it, at least hetook the counter-intuitive route, choosing someone older, wrinklier and lesssvelte than his wife, rather than the other way around.It has always been clear that, unlike many couples who areactually married, Charles and Camilla truly like each other. Theyshare a passion for hunting, fishing and other outdoor sports.They have bawdy senses of humor. More than that, itseems, the fun-loving Camilla is relatively uncomplicated (at least comparedwith Diana) and has been stolidly supportive of Prince Charlesover the years, despite all the angst the relationship hasput her through. The Prince of Wales and Camilla Shand,as she was then, hit it off from the firsttime they met, at a polo match in 1970. ButCharles was something of a playboy, and when he ditheredand went abroad to join the Navy, Camilla married alongtime suitor, Andrew Parker Bowles. The two remained friends withthe prince. Andrew Parker Bowles even took on the ludicrouslynamed ceremonial post of Silver Stick in Waiting to theprince, while his wife took another traditional role -- thatof the prince's mistress.Meanwhile, Charles married Lady Diana Spencer, a coltish 19-year-old who captivatedthe world -- but not her husband -- with herdemure good looks and blue-eyed charisma. The two were spectacularlyill-suited for each other and, sunk by rancor and poorbehavior on both sides, the marriage fell part.Although Charles later said he took up again with Camilla onlywhen his marriage broke down, Diana claimed that ""there werethree people in the marriage, so it was quite crowded.""She reportedly called Camilla ""the Rottweiler,"" while Camilla reportedly referredto her as ""that ridiculous creature.""It was Camilla Charles loved, and when he and Diana divorcedin 1996, it seemed that finally the couple could stopsneaking around. But in the national convulsion of grief followingDiana's horrific death from a car accident in Paris in1997, public opinion turned viciously against Parker Bowles. At onepoint, irate shoppers pelted her with bread rolls in herlocal grocery store.It was not until 1999, at a party in Piccadilly, thatthe two even appeared publicly together -- an orchestrated eventin which Parker Bowles walked well behind the prince.The two were together on Thursday night at a formal dinnerin Windsor Palace. In contrast to his first post-engagement appearancewith Diana all those years ago, in which he answereda question about whether he loved her by smirking andsaying ""whatever love means,"" Charles seemed positively ebullient this timearound.Dressed in fuschia and flashing her enormous diamond engagement ring, aroyal heirloom, Parker Bowles had the glow of a teenagerat the prom. ""I'm just coming down to earth,"" shesaid.
","Prince Charles announced unexpectedly that he would marry Camilla Parker Bowles in April at Windsor Castle. The British Prime minister, Archbishop of Canterbury, Queen Elizabeth, and Prince Charles' sons were pleased over the engagement. Brits reacted more with relief than happiness, viewing it as a logical conclusion to a difficult situation. Camilla will receive the title HRH the duchess of Cornwall.

D0919,D0919-B,"Prince Charles may have been unlucky in love in the past, but if Hong Kong's famed fortune tellers are anything to go by, his marriage to Camilla Parker Bowles will be a great success.Chinese soothsayers Friday predicted a happy and long marriage for the heir to the British throne, who announced he would wed his long-time lover Parker Bowles on April 8.""April 8 will be auspicious for people born in the Year of the Rat,"" feng shui Master Edwin Ma told AFP, referring to Charles' Chinese zodiac sign. ""It is a good day to get married.""Chinese fortune tellers divine the future by consulting ancient Chinese almanacs based on astrological observations.They also take into consideration the relative weights of forces that Chinese folklore believes emanate from all things, especially specific ""elements"" that are said to dominate different years.In the present Year of the Rooster, the element of metal predominates. However, Charles -- a keen believer in mysticism -- was born in 1948 under the influence of the element of water. Parker Bowles was born in 1947, the Year of the Pig, also a water sign.""That is good, because the metal element will burn the water,"" Ma explained. ""It will bring good fortune in the marriage.""Fellow feng shui Master Leung Tin-ming warned however that the marriage would not be without its challenges.""As this is their second marriage they will be better at keeping it stable ... but in many ways it will not be a normal marriage,"" Yeung told AFP. ""They will be apart for lots of the time and that will put stress on the relationship -- and also on Prince Charles' ability to carry out his duties.""
The heir to the British throne's engagement to his controversial love Camilla Parker Bowles elicited Friday a modicum of support both at home and abroad that one pundit predicted will increase with time.The British news media, which often runs no-holds barred stories on the private life of Prince Charles and his royal relatives, held fire for once by praising his plans to remarry on April 8 and saying Charles deserved happiness.It is ""the right time"" for Charles to wed his live-in girlfriend, whom he has known for more than 30 years, The Times said, praising the ""dignity and due care"" with which they have acted in recent years.The coupch, saying that although he jilted their beloved Diana, the prince still deserved ""sympathy and understanding"".Snap polls have shown most Britons were cool or even hostile to the marriage plans.However, David Frost, a prominent British broadcaster and interviewer, said he shared in the delight friends of Charles had for the wedding plans and predicted the public would eventually warm to them.""I think there will be quite a bit of controversy for 24 hours but then I think everyone will be happy and feel that Prince Charles deserves his happiness,"" Sir David said.The mass-circulation Daily Mirror struck the same note.""Admittedly the Prince of Wales behaved badly to Diana... But in that he is no different from thousands upon thousands of men. It doesn't make it right or acceptable, but it is not a reason for him to spend his life in misery.""""Our love for Diana is still strong and will continue. But it is time to move on,"" it added. ""Charles has the right to happiness.""The Sun, Britain's best-selling daily paper, celebrated that ""at last, Prince Charles makes an honest woman of Camilla Parker Bowles.""And it recalled, ""it must be remembered that nobody criticized Diana when she formed new friendships after her marriage had fallen apart"" -- a reference to the princess's own romantic affairs.The Daily Telegraph also told Britons to ""respond with maturity"" to the announcement and recalled that his sons ""Princes William and Harry are said to want the couple to be happy.""The Daily Express regretted that Parker Bowles and the prince had not wed when their romance was kindled in the 1970s, after a meeting at a polo match.""If only Charles had been brave enough to go against palace wishes 35 years ago and wed the young, single Camilla Shand, whom he adored, then Diana may have been spared heartbreak good day to get married.""In Australia, people were divided over Prince Charles' plans to re-marry, with republicans renewing calls for links to the British crown to be severed and loyalists congratulating the heir to the throne.
Britain's Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles embarked Friday on a two-month engagement ahead of their wedding at Windsor Castle where eager merchants were expecting a boost for business.The wedding of the heir to the British throne will make official a longtime relationship notorious for its role in ending his marriage to the late Princess Diana.Though the planned union has met with a sometimes cool, even hostile public response, it was welcomed by the often unsentimental and tough tabloid press, and pundits predict Britons will eventually warm to the relationship.In a first public appearance following the announcement on Thursday, the couple appeared at Windsor Castle, the royal family's residence just west of London and the venue for their civil wedding on April 8.A beaming Parker Bowles sported a full-length fuschia evening gown and a platinum diamond engagement ring -- a royal heirloom -- and said Charles had proposed to her on bended knee.The engagement, which gained public approval from Charles' mother Queen Elizabeth II and his sons, princes William and Harry, was feted at Windsor with a gala dinner for 250 guests.The event will likely make shopkeepers happy. An assistant at a sovenir shop, Deep Basra, said: ""We think it's going to be good for business. That's why we opened early today.""In an apparent bid to counter public criticism of their match, the couple have opted for a modest, private ceremony, and announced that Parker Bowles will not be queen once Charles takes the throne.Clarence House, the prince's London residence, said the wedding would be ""a largely private occasion for family and friends"", in marked contrast to Charles's sumptuous public wedding to Diana at St. Paul's Cathedral in 1981.The British public remains deeply loyal to Diana eight years after her death, in a car crash in Paris, and have shown mixed feelings about Charles' wedding to the woman whom she blamed for the breakup of her marriage.Parker Bowles will not take on Diana's former title, the Princess of Wales, but will be known after the marriage as the Duchess of Cornwall instead. Once Charles becomes king she will be known as the Princess Consort, instead of queen.The fact the wedding ceremony itself will be a civil affair is a nod to the Church of England, which does not recognize marriage between divorcees. Both the 56-year-old prince, who as king will be titular head of the Church of England, and Parker Bowles, 57, are divorced.The Anglican head, Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, voiced approval of the union, saying it was ""consistent with Church of England guidelines concerning remarriage"".Although marrying a long-term mistress is highly unorthodox for a British prince, there are no constitutional barriers.Far more troublesome for the couple will be winning over the British public.arriage had fallen apart"" -- a reference to the princess's own romantic affairs.A poll published Friday in the Daily Telegraph showed 65 percent felt Charles and Parker Bowles should be married, compared with 24 percent who were against it.
In opting for the future title of Princess Consort, Britain's royal bride-to-be Camilla Parker Bowles will be taking on a flexible public role which can be adapted according to both circumstances and public opinion, experts said Friday.Following her marriage to heir to the throne Prince Charles on April 8, the 57-year-old divorcee will officially become Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cornwall.Assuming Charles takes over as monarch from his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, Parker Bowles will then assume the specially-coined role of Princess Consort, royal officials said in announcing the nuptials on Thursday.While the British public now largely tolerates the couple's long relationship, opinion polls show Parker Bowles remains notably less popular than Princess Diana, Charles's ex-wife who died in a Paris car crash in 1997.Thus, many pundits have pointed out, making Parker Bowles Princess of Wales -- Diana's old title -- or queen would risk massive public ire.The title of Princess Consort is deliberately vague, experts say, allowing Parker Bowles to shape her public role over time, something greatly helped by the extreme vagueness of Britain's unwritten constitution on such issues.Apart from the monarch and the heir to the throne, ""no other member of the royal family has any constitutional obligations"", said Professor Adam Tomkins, a constitutional law expert from Glasgow University in Scotland.""Think about the current Duke of Edinburgh, the queen's husband. His role is not constitutionally defined, his role is not constitutionally required or legally mandated in any way,"" he said.""These days it looks like one of the considerations that is borne in mind when senior members of the royal family have shaped their role is public opinion.""Public opinion is certainly against a Queen Camilla -- an opinion poll in Friday's Daily Telegraph newspaper showed that while 40 percent of those asked backed the Princess Consort notion, just seven percent thought she should be queen, with 47 percent wanting no title at all.Royal pundits believe Parker Bowles will initially keep a low profile, and gradually build up her place in public life through carefully-chosen charitable works and the like.In the Daily Telegraph poll, 57 percent of respondents thought Parker Bowles should carry out the normal duties of a monarch's wife, whatever her title.Her closest role model is seen as Prince Albert, the husband of 19th century monarch Queen Victoria, who was made Prince Consort and overcame initial public suspicion to become a well-loved figure.Camilla's role was purely a matter for the royal family and government, as there were no constitional issues at stake, Tomkins said.""Parliament has had the unambiguously clear power since the late 17th century to legislate on any matter of the crown,"" he said, pointing out that the 1701 Act of Settlement even changed the royal succession.""So if parliament can change the identity of the monarch... then parliament can certainly decide that we can call her Queen Camilla, or parliament can certainly decide that we can call her Mrs Parker Bowles,"" he said.The one sticking point could be opinion in more conservative countries from the Commonwealth, the association of former British colonies, who might not welcome a twice-married adulterer as their de facto queen, Tomkins added.""I think it's extremely unlikely that any constitutional problem will arise in Britain as a result of this marriage, but if any constitutional problem is going to arise as a result of this marriage it is more likely to be a problem for the Commonwealth.""
Britain's Prince Charles and bride-to-be Camilla Parker Bowles kept a low profile Friday as they began their two-month engagement ahead oftic, very exciting and good fun,"" White told AFP.Both restaurants and souvenir shops were likely to profit from the surge in interest, she added.In an apparent bid to counter public criticism of their match, the couple have opted for a modest, private ceremony, and announced that Parker Bowles will not be queen once Charles takes the throne.The British public remains deeply loyal to Diana eight years after her death in a car crash in Paris, and have shown mixed feelings about Charles' wedding to the woman whom Diana blamed for the breakup of her marriage.Parker Bowles will not take on Diana's former title, the Princess of Wales, but will be known after the marriage as the Duchess of Cornwall instead. Once Charles becomes king she will be known as the Princess Consort.The fact the wedding ceremony itself will be a civil affair is a nod to the Church of England, which does not permit divorcees to marry again in church. Both the prince, who as king will be titular head of the Church of England, and Parker Bowles are divorced.Although marrying a long-term mistress is unorthodox for a British prince, there are no constitutional barriers.Far more troublesome for the couple will be winning over the public. Diana, describing her breakup with Charles and divorce in 1996, famously quipped that ""there were three of us in this marriage so it was a bit crowded"".The announcement marks the culmination of a slow but steady transition for the couple, from avoiding being seen together for years to appearing at public events as a couple, and now marriage.Charles first met Parker Bowles in 1970, but their relationship ended when he entered the navy and she married another suitor, army officer Andrew Parker Bowles.Although this first marriage lasted until 1995, Parker Bowles continued to see the prince during his stormy marriage to Diana.
Thirty years after their first romance, Prince Charles and Camilla ParkerBowles, both now graying divorcees, will finally wed in a civil ceremony and putthe official seal on a relationship Princess Diana blamed for the breakdown ofher marriage to the man who would be king.In a nod to those who have not warmed to Camilla, the royal family said Thursdayshe will never hold the title of Queen. But after the tribulations of arelationship that has played out over three decades, Charles seemed overjoyed tobe able to take her as his wife.""I'm very excited,"" the usually reserved prince said as he entered London'sstoried Goldsmith's Hall, home of the gold and silversmiths' guild, and lookedat wedding rings.In their first public appearance together since the announcement, Charles andCamilla smiled broadly as they walked into a reception at Windsor Castle onThursday night, and the guests applauded.A radiant Parker Bowles, wearing a fuchsia gown, showed off her engagement ringagainst a black clutch bag. She told the crowd the prince had gone down on oneknee to propose.""I'm just coming down to Earth,"" she said.The April 8 wedding between the two divorcees will be a civil ceremony atWindsor Castle, in contrast to the pageantry of Charles' 1981 wedding to Dianaat St. Paul's Cathedral. The divorce issue is a delicate matter for the man whowould be head of the Church of England.The engagement ring Charles, 56, has given his fiancee is a royal familyheirloom, according to the prince's office, Clarence House. The platinum bandhas a square-cut central diamond with three diamond baguettes on each side.Parker Bowles, 57, was to wear it Thursday evening to a dinner at WindsorCastle.The news of the nuptials was received with warmth in Britain, where publicopinion was once so hostile to Camilla that shoppers pelted her with rolls in asupermarket.The House of Commons burst into cheers at the news, and ordinary Britons offeredtheir congratulations. Charles and Diana's sons welcomed theannouncement.""We are both very happy for our father and Camilla, and we wish them all theluck in the future,"" Prince William, 22, and Prince Harry, 20, said in astatement.One Very Important Person also gave her blessing: Queen Elizabeth II granted thenecessary formal permission for the union. And as mother of the bridegroom saidshe and Prince Philip ""are very happy that the Prince of Wales and Mrs. ParkerBowles are to marry.""To mark the royal engagement, the queen decided that the Round Tower at WindsorCastle should be illuminated Thursday night.The civil marriage will take place at the castle and will be followed by aservice of prayer and dedication at St. George's Chapel within the castle walls.Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, spiritual head of the church ofEngland, will preside, the prince's office at Clarence Housesaid.Williams said Thursday that the wedding service plans ""have my strong supportand are consistent with Church of England guidelines concerningremarriage.""The archbishop's approval and participation could well help allay concerns ofthose with questions about the fitness of the divorced Charles to be supremegovernor of church when he becomes king. In general, the Church of England, theestablished faith of the nation, disapproves of remarriage of divorced people inchurch.There is no Act of Parliament saying the wife of a king should be queen, but itis a historical convention. Clarence House said there was no legal reasonCharles' second wife could not be queen, and that the decision was made by thecouple.When Charles accedes to the throne, his wife will be known as the HRH _ HerRoyal Highness _ Princess Consort.Prince Charles, in addition to being Prince of Wales, is Duke of Cornwall andRothesay. After her marriage, Parker Bowles will not use the title Princess ofWales, but would like people to call her the Duchess of Cornwall, Clarence Housesaid.Prime Minister Tony Blair said he was delighted at the impending marriage. Athis regular meeting with the queen Wednesday night, the two discussed thewedding plans, and Blair gave her legal advice before she went on to grant thewedding her royal consent, officials said. They refused to discuss theadvice.Perhaps the most important vote of approval is still pending.The British public who took Princess Diana to their hearts have been dividedabout the Camilla-Charles romance. The nation's tabloid press dubbed ParkerBowles ""the other woman"" as details of their relationship became public in1992.But in the years since Diana's 1997 death in a Paris car crash, much of the illwill against Charles has eased. The warmth of his relationship with his sons hasbeen seen positively and suggests a warmer character than he is often creditedwith.Parker Bowles, who stays well out of the limelight, has won a degree of respectfor her discretion. Many people simply wish them well as a couple whose love haswithstood the test of years of anguish and vilification""They are clearly very much in love. It must be the end of a series of nightmareyears for Camilla. ... They are entitled to have their own happiness the same aseveryone else,"" Winston Churchill, the grandson of Britain's wartime primeminister, told Sky News.On the streets of central London, many Britons welcomed the announcement butsaid they may never love Camilla as they had Diana.""Diana is still in so many people's hearts,"" said Chris Morris, 54, a buildingengineer. ""Queen Camilla wouldn't be so popular.""Charles, the queen's eldest son first met Camilla in the early 1970s and theyhad a brief romance which ended in late 1972 when the prince was called away onnaval duties. Camilla married Andrew Parker Bowles, a long-standing admirer, in1973.Throughout the late 1970s Charles and Camilla kept in touch, and they becameclose friends again toward the end of the decade. They remained so afterCharles' 1981 marriage to Diana.Diana blamed the friendship for the failure of her marriage to the Prince ofWales. ""There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded,"" Dianasaid in a 1995 TV interview.While the saga of the disintegrating royal marriage played out publicly, ParkerBowles was often cast as the villain, the object both of invective for being a""marriage breaker"" and of ridicule over tapes of intimate conversations betweenher and the prince that emerged in 1992.In 1994, Prince Charles admitted in a TV documentary that he had strayed fromhis marriage vows, but insisted the infidelity happened only after the marriagewas ""irretrievably broken down, us both having tried."" It was widely assumed,but never confirmed, that Parker Bowles was the other woman.Charles and Diana divorced in 1996, a year before she was killed. Parker Bowlesobtained her divorce from army officer Andrew Parker Bowles in1995.In April 1997, Parker Bowles took a tentative step into public life when shebecame patron of the National Osteoporosis Society. An official photograph wasreleased to mark the occasion. In July that year, Charles hosted a party forCamilla to celebrate her 50th birthday.The couple appeared less frequently in public after Diana's death in August1997, but in 1999 Camilla met Charles' sons Prince William and Prince Harry forthe first time.In recent years, she has regularly accompanied Charles to galas and becomeaccustomed to appearing in front of the media.Last year, a poll indicated that more Britons support Prince Charles marryingParker Bowles than oppose it. Thirty-two percent of respondents to the Populuspoll said they would support Charles if he remarried, while 29 percent wereopposed. Thirty-eight percent said they didn't care and 2 percent had noopinion.
Camilla Parker Bowles could not be more different from PrincessDiana.Where Prince Charles' first wife had glamour and magnetism that made her one ofthe great icons of our age, Parker Bowles seems more at ease tending to acountry garden than the luminaries of the social circuit.It's one of the things that binds her to husband-to-be Prince Charles _ bothhave a passion for the peace of rural life, riding after the hounds and takinglong walks.Despite her discreet manner, Parker Bowles was once widely vilified inBritain.Diana called her a ""Rottweiler."" The tabloid press dubbed her ""the other woman.""As details of her relationship with Charles emerged in 1992, irate shoppers at asupermarket pelted her with bread rolls.But since Diana's death in a 1997 Paris car crash, the public has gradually cometo accept her as Charles consort _ no doubt a major factor in clearing the wayfor their marriage.She was born Camilla Shand in London on July 17, 1947, and grew up on a countryestate in southern England, a granddaughter of the 3rd Baron of Ashcombe. It wasan upbringing that made her very much at home in the upper class circles of therural rich.After attending Queen's Gate School in London's exclusive South Kensingtondistrict and finishing schools in Switzerland, she ""came out"" socially as adebutante in 1965.Her great-grandmother Alice Keppel had a love affair with King Edward VII,Prince Charles's great-great-grandfather. The young Camilla is said to havebrought that up after meeting the prince at a polo match in the early1970s.""My great-grandmother was your great-great-grandfather's mistress, so how aboutit?"" she is reported to have told the prince.Romance blossomed, but the relationship cooled after Prince Charles went to seaas a naval officer. Shand married cavalry officer Maj. Andrew Parker-Bowles andhad a son and daughter, Tom and Laura, in the 1970s.But Charles and his former love remained close friends, even after his marriageto Lady Diana Spencer.After Charles and Diana divorced in 1996, Parker Bowles made a few tentativesteps out of the shadows and into the prince's life. The attempt to find publicacceptance was suspended in the national trauma over Diana's death, but resumedand slowly succeeded.Newspapers began to note that Parker Bowles, so unlike Diana and even Charles,was very discreet and never could be lured into commenting on the royal marriagebreakup.This and the fact that she clearly had no interest in fame and celebrity, wentsome way to winning a degree of public acceptance.The announcement that she will not become queen when Charles becomes king, isprobably an indication that both accept divisions in public feeling over theacceptability of a divorced woman as queen.And in the future bride's wish to be referred to as the Duchess of Cornwall, notthe Princess of Wales, there may be a tacit understanding that the memory ofDiana, Princess of Wales, will remain respected.
A group that wants Australia to sever its ties with the British monarchyreported a surge in new members Friday after Prince Charles said he will marrylongtime companion Camilla Parker Bowles.The Australian Republican Movement (ARM) said its Web site has been overwhelmedwith hundreds of membership applications since news of the April 8 wedding brokeThursday night Australian time.ARM chairman John Warhurst said the ""surge in interest"" could not be describedas anti-Parker Bowles, demonized as the mistress whom Princess Diana blamed forbreaking up her marriage with the prince, which ended in divorce in1996.""There's no anti-Camilla feeling by any means; Charles is the issue forrepublicans but she'll come along with the package as the wife of our head ofstate,"" Warhurst said. But it's ""Charles, who hasn't been here in 11 years _that ignites people's republican passions.""Prime Minister John Howard, however, rejected as ""silly"" the argument that themarriage will renew calls to change Australia into a republic from aconstitutional monarchy with the British king or queen as its head of state.Australians voted to retain the monarchy in a 1999 referendum.""I don't think it's got anything to do with the debate about the constitutionalmonarchy,"" Howard told Nine Network television. ""It's about the lives of twopeople.""""I congratulate them, I wish them well, I think it's sensible and a good thingthat they've decided to marry,"" he added.A Newspoll survey last month found that 46 percent of Australian adults want arepublic compared to 35 percent who favor maintaining the constitutionalmonarchy.Australia became an independent state in 1901. But, like many former outposts ofthe British Empire such as Canada, it still recognizes Britain's monarch as headof state.The queen's representative in Australia is the governor general, a largelyceremonial role, but one with potentially sweeping powers, including the abilityto dismiss a government and the prime minister _ something that has happenedonly once, in 1975.Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy (ACM) accused the ARM of intruding""into this happy occasion"" to revive interest in their cause.New Zealand's Anglican Church welcomed the announcement.""As a church leader, I think it's far better that he should marry and have aclear married relationship if he is actually living with this person,"" Bishop ofChristchurch, David Coles, said.Parker Bowles will not accompany the Prince Charles when he departs this monthon a tour of Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand and Fiji, officialssaid.

So ends years of tabloid and taxicab speculation.In a surprise announcement, Britain's future king, Prince Charles,declared Thursday that he would marry his live-in lover, CamillaParker Bowles, in a spring ceremony at Windsor Castle.The divorcee will never become Queen Camilla, nor will she take thetitle princess of Wales that was bestowed on Diana, her predecessor.Diana's marriage to Charles ended in divorce, partly because of ParkerBowles, and she died a year later, along with her boyfriend, in aParis car accident.In a sort of constitutional compromise, Parker Bowles, 57, willreceive the title her royal highness the duchess of Cornwall. IfCharles becomes king, she will be called her royal highness theprincess consort. ``Those are the only royal titles that have beenconfirmed so far,'' said a representative of the prince of Wales.Charles' great-uncle, King Edward VIII, abdicated in 1936 so hecould marry an American divorcee. However, Britain barely batted aneyelash at the consequence of the prince's impending nuptials.But the newspapers were having a field day. Even the stuffy Timesof London couldn't resist. Its headline read: ``After 30 Years,Charles Puts His Affair in Order.''Prime Minister Tony Blair wished the couple ``every happiness'' onbehalf of himself and his Cabinet. Archbishop of Canterbury RowanWilliams, who serves as spiritual leader of the worldwide AnglicanChurch, said, ``I am pleased that Prince Charles and Mrs. CamillaParker Bowles have decided to take this important step.''The announcement came in the form of a brief, formal statement fromthe prince's household, which read, ``It is with great pleasure thatthe marriage of HRH the prince of Wales and Mrs. Camilla Parker Bowlesis announced. It will take place on Friday 8th April, 2005, at WindsorCastle.''Later, Charles issued a statement that said, ``Mrs. Parker Bowlesand I are absolutely delighted. It will be a very special day for usand our families.''Queen Elizabeth gave the union her royal blessing. ``The duke ofEdinburgh and I are very happy that the prince of Wales and Mrs.Parker Bowles are to marry. We have given them our warmest good wishesfor their future together.''The 56-year-old prince's two sons by Diana, Prince William andPrince Harry, announced that they too were delighted at the news oftheir father's marriage.Although the marriage will cause little political repercussionaround Britain, the news dominated the airwaves Thursday. Discussionsand surveys showed general acceptance of the marriage but strongreservations about Charles' new wife becoming ``Queen Camilla.''The memory of Diana is still strong among the British public, whichsaw Parker Bowles as the spoiler of what began as a fairy-talemarriage.Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, a onetime nursery school teacher,were wed in a lavish, glamorous ceremony in 1981 in London's classiclandmark St. Paul's Cathedral.Their marriage was made in tabloid heaven, their every movescrutinized and documented by eager paparazzi. But it was also markedby widespread speculation about their apparent unhappiness and byquestions of infidelity.In 1993, the tabloid press published a transcript of a tapedexplicit phone conversation between Charles and Parker Bowles, thenwife of a British brigadier general.Charles' relationship with Parker Bowles began in 1971 when theymet at a polo match on the grounds of Windsor Castle. They continuedto see each other throughout Charles' tumultuous marriage to Diana,who said the relationship was the cause of her eventual breakup withthe prince. ``There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bitcrowded,'' she said in a TV interview.From the beginning, it was clear that Parker Bowles, who married in1973 and divorced in 1995, shared Charles' sporting life more thanDiana, his junior by 13 years.Since the early days of his marriage, Charles was clearly more athome on a horse or shooting grouse and fishing for salmon than on adance floor, listening to pop music or watching ballet, which wereamong Diana's favorite pastimes.Charles and Parker Bowles were often seen fox hunting together oron the polo field where Charles was a regular player.Charles and Diana divorced in 1996. Diana, as princess of Wales,found her calling as an active patron of myriad charities,particularly those supporting sick and disadvantaged children and oldpeople. She championed AIDS victims and traveled to war-torn andpoverty-stricken countries, visiting orphanages and hospitals.Her sudden death in a car accident in August 1997 in Paris, alongwith boyfriend Dodi Fayed, provoked an outpouring of grief in Britainand abroad, forcing Charles and Parker Bowles to keep theirrelationship in the background for some time.Gradually the couple began appearing together in public incarefully choreographed occasions. Many see their decision to marry asthe logical conclusion to a difficult situation.``I don't think the public is hostile to the remarriage,'' saidSarah Richardson, a constitutional historian at Warwick University.``What does surprise me is the recognition of her role as princessconsort, which will put her in a spotlight where she will have todeliver and be an active supporter of Charles almost on a par withDiana.''Relief rather than pleasure was expressed by many Britonsinterviewed Thursday by TV networks.``I guess it was better that they got married rather than not,''said Marianne McElwee, 24, a Web site manager.``I'm not keen on her,'' McElwee added. ``After all, Charles wasalways in a relationship with her before he met Diana and he went onseeing her after that, which didn't make Diana very happy.''``I think it was inevitable, but I feel saddened,'' marketingconsultant David Pickering, 44, told the British Broadcasting Corp.Although the acceptance of a king-to-be, himself divorced, with adivorcee wife, is indicative of the changing face of Britain, theannouncement also forces official recognition of the flawed and humanside of royalty.Archbishop Williams said Thursday on TV broadcasts, ``Thesearrangements have my strong support and are consistent with Church ofEngland guidelines concerning remarriage, which the Prince of Walesfully accepts as a committed Anglican and as prospective SupremeGovernor of the Church of England.''The monarch of Britain is also the recognized head of the Church ofEngland; Defender of the Faith is one of the many royal titles. It hadbeen considered unsuitable for kings and queens to marry divorcedpartners.Over the years, however, a slow change has come over the royalfamily as one by one, Queen Elizabeth's daughter and two of her sonswent through divorce.``This wedding is a pragmatic response and reflection of the factthat Charles is in this long-term relationship and it would be moredifficult and embarrassing for him to carry on with it than to getmarried,'' said historian Richardson.Royal marriages must be approved on several levels, so Blair'sstatement of approval was essential. Charles also will require an Actof Parliament before his wedding day, a foregone conclusion in thiscase.
","News of Prince Charles' and Camilla Parker Bowles' engagement dominated the airways. People generally accepted the marriage but had strong reservations about Camilla becoming ""Queen Camilla."" Prince Charles' senior advisors said he must choose between marrying or banishing his long-term partner. Camilla agreed to the marriage, but only to present the Brits with the conventional lifestyle required before he could become King. Chinese soothsayers predicted a long and happy marriage for Prince Charles and Camilla. They determined that the wedding date would be auspicious based on Charles' Chinese zodiac sign. ",Charles was advised he needed to choose between marrying or banishing Camilla before he could become King. Tony Blair gave the queen legal advice before she approved the wedding. The House of Commons burst into cheers at the news of the engagement. The couple itself decided Camilla would not be queen. There was no legal impediment to the title. The Archbishop's approval and participation could help allay concerns about a divorced Charles being supreme governor of the Church of England. Camilla divorced Andrew Parker Bowles in 1995. The Australian Republican Movement saw a surge of new memberships after the announcement. ,"Praise for the marriage of Prince Charles and Mrs. Bowles continues. The House of Commons reportedly cheered. The British media praised the plans. The London Times reported that the Prince had been advised to marry or discontinue his affair. A Friday poll in the Daily Telegraph had 65% for the marriage and 24% against. Reactions in Australia were mixed, with the republican movement gaining more support. The New Zealand Anglican Church welcomed the announcement. Hong Kong fortune tellers declared that the marriage will be a great success. ","According to The Times, senior advisors told Prince Charles that he must either marry Parker Bowles or banish her from his life to avoid a constitutional crisis should he become king. If he became king, she would have the title of Princess Consort, a vague title that would let her develop her role over time. In Australia a group that wants to sever ties with the British monarchy reported a surge of new members in reaction to the news. The Prime Minister announced that the marriage would not cause Australia to abandon the British monarch as head of state. "

The International Committee of the Red Cross insisted Friday thatBritain does not hold any women prisoners in Iraq, although thedemand of militants holding a British man hostage is that femaleprisoners be freed.The ICRC added that it was ready to act as a mediator to help freeKenneth Bigley.The British government said more than 100,000 leaflets had beendistributed in Baghdad containing a personal plea from Bigley'sfamily and an appeal to his captors to release him.Bigley, an engineer, was kidnapped two weeks ago in Baghdad alongwith two American colleagues who have since been beheaded. TheIslamic militants claiming responsibility for Bigley's abduction havedemanded the release of female Iraqi prisoners. The Britishgovernment has repeatedly stressed that it does not hold any.The U.S. military says it has two Iraqi women in custody _ RihabRashid Taha, a scientist who became known as ""Dr. Germ"" for helpingIraq make weapons with anthrax, and Huda Salih Mahdi Ammash, abiotech researcher dubbed ""Mrs. Anthrax.""The ICRC, which visits prisons around the world to monitor thecondition and treatment of prisoners, told The Associated Press thatit had repeatedly visited Britain's sole detention facility in Iraq,near the southern city of Basra.""We have repeatedly visited Shaiba, the only British detention placein Iraq. There are no women detained there,"" said Rana Sidani at theICRC in Geneva, Switzerland.Sidani said the ICRC did not have any contacts with the militantgroup, controlled by Jordanian terror mastermind Abu Musabal-Zarqawi, believed to be holding Bigley.""We stand ready if we are contacted to mediate,"" she added.Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said Thursday that Britain would not paya ransom or meet any political demands to secure Bigley's release.""If we did not have this position there would be many, many morepeople who would be kidnapped, and the world would be less safe,""Straw told British Broadcasting Corp. television.The Foreign Office said Friday that leaflets had been distributed inthe streets around 28 mosques in Baghdad.

Puzzled and angry at being barred from the United States, YusufIslam, the singer formerly known as Cat Stevens, returned to Londonvowing to find out why.Surrounded by a throng of reporters at Heathrow Airport on Thursday,Islam said it was ludicrous that he's on Washington's no-fly list,suspected of ties to terrorists, and said he would challenge thedecision to block him from entering the country.""Half of me wants to smile, and half of me wants to growl. The wholething is totally ridiculous,"" said Islam, who had a string of hits inthe 1960s and '70s, but abandoned his music career after convertingto Islam.""Everybody knows who I am. I am no secret figure. Everybody knows mycampaigning for charity, for peace. There's got to be a whole lot ofexplanation.""Islam's United Airlines flight to Dulles International Airport wasdiverted to Maine's Bangor International Airport when U.S. officialsreviewing the passenger list discovered he was aboard.According to his Web site, the singer was last in the United Statestwo months ago with his record company. During a visit in May he metwith officials of the White House Office of Faith-Based and CommunityInitiatives ""to talk about philanthropic work,"" according to WhiteHouse spokeswoman Claire Buchan.U.S. authorities provided few details about Islam's allegedconnection to terrorism or when he was added to the watch list.Homeland Security spokesman Brian Doyle would only say that theintelligence community has recently obtained information that""further heightens concern"" about Islam.""Yusuf Islam has been placed on the watch lists because of activitiesthat could potentially be related to terrorism,"" Doyle said. ""It's aserious matter.""A second government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,said U.S. authorities think donations from Islam may have ended uphelping to fund blind sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, convicted for a plotto bomb New York City landmarks, and Hamas, a Palestinian militantgroup considered a terrorist organization by the United States.British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw complained Wednesday to U.S.officials about their treatment of Islam, telling U.S. Secretary ofState Colin Powell ""that this action should not have been taken,"" theForeign Office said. It was not clear whether Straw meant Islam'sdetention, or his inclusion on the watch list.Islam, who was traveling with his 21-year-old daughter, Maymanah,told reporters in London he was treated well by FBI agents. He saidhe was bound for Nashville to ""initiate some recordings.""Islam said he had been well treated by U.S. officials. ""The onepositive thing I can say is that a lot of security officers arepleased because they got my autograph,"" he said.""People make mistakes. I just hope they made a big mistake. We'llsee,"" he said.A statement on Islam's Web site said he was seeking furtherinformation from U.S. authorities ""so that we can challenge thedecision to refuse him entry.""___On the Net, http://www.yusufislam.org.uk
The singer once known as Cat Stevens, now a peace activist whose namewas on a U.S. list of people suspected of having terrorist links,will receive a peace prize from a foundation headed by former Sovietleader Mikhail Gorbachev, organizers said Monday.The singer, now named Yusuf Islam, is expected to attend the ceremonyon Rome's Capitoline Hill on Wednesday, said Enzo Cursio, a spokesmanfor the Gorbachev Foundation. Islam will receive the award from RomeMayor Walter Veltroni and Gorbachev, the spokesman said.In September, the British musician was expelled from the UnitedStates after authorities diverted his London-to-Washington flight toMaine to remove him, saying he was suspected of ties to terrorism.He says he was a victim of an ""unjust and arbitrary system,"" and thathe has denounced terrorism.The ""Man for Peace"" award was being given to Islam ""for hisdedication to promote peace, the reconciliation of people and tocondemn terrorism,"" said a press release by the Gorbachev Foundationand Rome's City Hall.The ceremony Wednesday will mark the opening of the fifth reunion ofNobel Peace Prize laureates, a meeting organized every year in Romeby the Gorbachev Foundation. The reunion ends Friday.Other recipients of the ""Man for Peace"" award include Italianactor-director Roberto Benigni, who won in 2002. Benigni is thedirector of the Oscar-winning ""Life is Beautiful.""
The government ordered U.S. airlines Friday to turn over personalinformation about passengers so it can test a system for identifyingpotential terrorists. The move was expected but nonetheless broughtprotests from civil libertarians worried about invasions of privacy.Under the system, called ""Secure Flight,"" the Transportation SecurityAdministration will compare passenger data with names on twogovernment watch lists: a ""no-fly"" list comprises known or suspectedterrorists, and a ""watch"" list names people who should face tighterscrutiny before boarding planes.""Secure Flight represents a significant step in securing domestic airtravel and safeguarding national security information, namely, thewatchlists,"" the TSA said in a notice announcing the order.The TSA order gives 72 airlines until Nov. 23 to turn overcomputerized data for passengers who traveled on domestic flightsduring June.The data _ known as passenger name records, or PNR _ can includecredit card numbers, travel itineraries, addresses, telephone numbersand meal requests. The latter can indicate a passenger's religion orethnicity.Barry Steinhardt, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer, said amajor problem is the lists include the names of many people who arenot security risks.Among those subjected to extra scrutiny in recent months was Sen.Edward M. Kennedy. The singer formerly known as Cat Stevens, nowYusuf Islam, is trying to get off the no-fly list after he wasremoved from a London-to-Washington flight because the list said hehad links to terrorists.The lists are ""a hodgepodge of information, accurate and inaccurate,""Steinhardt said. ""They're the basement of the program, and the flooris rotten.""The government has sought to improve its process for checkingpassengers since the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackers exposed holes. Thegovernment's first attempt was scuttled because of fears thegovernment would have access to too much personal information.The TSA says Secure Flight differs from the previous plan because itdoes not compare personal data with commercial databases. The agencysaid, however, it will test the passenger information ""on a verylimited basis"" against commercial data.Under the current system, the government shares parts of thewatchlists with airlines, which are responsible for making suresuspected terrorists don't get on planes. But the airlines don't haveaccess to everyone who's considered a threat to aviation because someof the names of known or suspected terrorists are classified.People within the commercial aviation industry say there are morethan 100,000 names on the lists.Under Secure Flight, the government would take responsibility forchecking passengers. That was among recommendations of the commissionthat investigated the Sept. 11 attacks.An airline industry representative said the carriers support thegovernment's goals but remain wary of privacy concerns.""U.S. airlines have long-standing concerns that center on privacy andoperational issues,"" said James May, president of the Air TransportAssociation, which represents major airlines. ""We hope many of theissues will be successfully addressed during the test phase of SecureFlight.""In issuing the order, the TSA didn't resolve another key concern forprivacy advocates: redress. There still is no formal way for peoplemistakenly identified as terrorists, or who have the same name as asuspected terrorist, to get off the lists.Justin Oberman, who heads the TSA office that's developing SecureFlight, said the agency will set up a passenger advocate's office tohandle complaint from passengers. He said a process of redress wasn'tneeded until Secure Flight begins.Oberman said the TSA will present the final plan for Secure Flightearly next year.___On the Net:Transportation Security Administration: http://www.tsa.gov
Midway through live analysis of the presidential debate on ""The DailyShow"" on Thursday night, the host, Jon Stewart, called on his""correspondents"" in the field for some in-depth analysis.""Ed, how are the Kerry people feeling?""""Ecstatic, Jon,"" came the response. ""Kerry's people couldn't behappier. Their candidate went up against a sitting war presidentwho's never lost a debate and held his own.""""OK,"" Stewart said. ""And Rob, what's the mood at the Bush camp?""""Triumph, Jon,"" the correspondent said. ""Orgasmic triumph. Their manfaced off against John Kerry, a golden-tongued virtuoso of words andcaptain of the Yale debate team. He's been honing his oratoricalskills since the age of 3, and the way they see it, by not allowinghimself to be reduced to tears, the president was the big winnertonight.""The exchange -- which ended with the Bush campaign ""correspondent""pleading ""You gotta re-elect him!"" -- was a clever evisceration bothof the shallowness of campaign spin and of the news media's capacityfor buying that spin, and ran on Comedy Central the same evening whenthe campaign spin doctors were earnestly toiling away on othernetworks. Just to make sure there was no misunderstanding, during acommercial break, Stewart offered a reminder to the guffawingaudience in his studio on West 54th Street. ""Remember,"" he saidgravely. ""We are not actual newspeople.""Fake news is certainly the comic trope of the moment. Besides ""TheDaily Show,"" Ali G uses the news talk show format to absurd ends,mocking politicians, celebrities and panels of self-proclaimedexperts. The humorist Andy Borowitz files daily stories in perfectnews-service deadpan on his Web site, www.BorowitzReport.com. Thephony newspaper The Onion is expanding its print operation to newcities.And in a strange turnabout, mainstream news outlets have beenclamoring to introduce news satire to their programming, never mindthat mainstream news is often what is being mocked. The ABC newsmagazine ""Prime Time Live"" recently began closing the program with atwo-minute musical rendition of satirical headlines. Mo Rocca,formerly of ""The Daily Show,"" played the role of wisecracking on-aircorrespondent for ""Larry King Live"" during the political conventions.And Borowitz is a regular on CNN and appears alongside straight-facedlegal experts on Court TV.""Today I spent an hour on Court TV talking about the Peterson case,and I don't know anything about the Peterson case,"" Borowitz said onWednesday. ""It's perfectly appropriate on mainstream news shows nowto have a satirist in the mix.""Satirists, perhaps not surprisingly, are loath to talk earnestlyabout what they do; Stewart is particularly averse to speakingseriously about humor. But when pressed, most say their opening hascome because of a polarized electorate that suspects the media ofdoing the other side's bidding, coupled with high-profilejournalistic scandals.Let down, perhaps, by the mainstream media, 21 percent of peopleunder 30 say they are learning about the campaign from satiricalsources like ""The Daily Show"" and the late-night televisionmonologues, up from 9 percent in 2000, according to a Pew ResearchCenter study released in January. Comedy Central mocked CNN's motto-- ""The most trusted name in news"" -- and Walter Cronkite's onetimereputation (as America's most trusted man) on a billboard during theRepublican National Convention, which proclaimed ""The Daily Show"" as""the most trusted name in fake news.""""This is big because there is this gigantic imbalance and somethinghas got to fill it,"" said the cultural critic Neal Gabler, who isobsessed with ""The Daily Show."" ""Young people get the attitude, thedeflationary truth-telling attitude of these shows because they can'tfind it elsewhere,"" he said.Rocca agreed. ""The premise of any joke delivered by oddballnewscasters is that they're making fun of the media's treatment ofnews as much as they are the subjects of the news,"" he said. ""And ifthere's one thing that everyone can agree on, it's that, right orwrong, they hate the press.""Once they have the audience's sympathies, fake news purveyors have asimple task: be funny.""A well-told joke that has a Republican target, if it's cleverenough, gets Republicans to laugh too,"" Rocca said.News satire of course is a time-tested gag. Mark Twain wrote fakenews stories, and they were a staple of The National Lampoon in the1970s. The television era has produced a steady supply of news spoofslike ""Not Necessarily the News,"" ""That Was the Week That Was"" and""Weekend Update"" on ""Saturday Night Live."" But even the satiriststhemselves confess to being surprised by the sudden market for theircraft.""When I got out of school everyone wanted to write for sitcoms,""Borowitz said. ""The idea that you could have a career as a prosesatirist. It's hard to imagine that even five years ago."" The latestevidence of the shift: ""America (The Book)"" by Stewart and ""DailyShow"" colleagues, a spoof of a civics textbook, will appear as No. 1on the New York Times nonfiction best-seller list of Oct. 10.Of course no self-respecting satirist would take credit for anythingso profound as affecting the political discourse, or even to having apolitical point of view. Asked about the politics of writers for ""TheDaily Show,"" Ben Karlin, the executive producer, insisted, ""We haveno agenda other than holding on to our cushy, high-paying, basiccable jobs.""As for the Pew study crediting shows like his for teaching a fifth ofyoung Americans about politics, Karlin said he was dubious. For onething, he said, the audience could not possibly get the jokes if itdid not already know the news stories that were being spoofed.""People are getting their news from the tops of taxi cabs, fromsluglines on Yahoo and from accidentally stopping on CNN,"" he said.The hyped-up news cycle has been a boon to the fake news racket. Forone thing, there is a steady flow of new material. And for another, amore informed public means a bigger potential audience. When CatStevens was barred from entering the country late last month aftershowing up on a terrorist watch list, Borowitz said he sat down towrite a fake news story about it. ""You don't have to start by sayingto the audience, 'See, there was this singer-songwriter from the '70snamed Cat Stevens,""' he said. ""In comedy parlance that was called theset-up. Now you can go straight to the punch line."" (Borowitz came upwith ""Angry Cat Stevens Vows to Resume Singing: Broadcasts Threat onAl-Jazeera."")On its most basic level, news satire derives its humor from thejuxtaposition of earnest newspeak and the absurd. ""Nothing is moreserious and pompous than a network news anchor or the earnest prosestyle of a newspaper,"" Borowitz said. ""The parody of the stylebecomes a joke in and of itself.""The form of news satire on ""The Daily Show"" is more sophisticated,mocking not just the style of the news but the conventions ofjournalism; for example, the mainstream news media's fixation withfairness.""There's some weird handcuffs on the mainstream news so that theyfeel that no matter what, they have to present both sides of theargument, even if one side of an argument is wrong,"" Karlin said.""The idea that we give the guilty an equal opportunity to defendthemselves -- we have no idea why.""On one fake newscast, Stewart asked a correspondent in the field forhis opinion on the Swift Boat veterans claims against Sen. JohnKerry. ""My opinion?"" the reporter responded. ""I don't have opinions.I'm a reporter, Jon. My job is to spend half the time repeating whatone side says, and half the time repeating the other. Little thingcalled objectivity; might want to look it up.""(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)Although he is coy about his politics, Stewart seems to relishmocking conservatives more than liberals, and at his studio onThursday night, the crowd of people in their 20s, divided almostevenly between men and women, made no secret of their distaste forPresident Bush while watching the debate on monitors before the showbegan.On Friday, Michael Hoyt, the executive editor of the ColumbiaJournalism Review, said that in some ways Stewart was providing acounterbalance to the conservatism of the Fox News Channel.""People are hungry for some sort of attitude and guidance through anocean of spin,"" he said. ""Fox supplies it in one way, and Jon Stewartin another. Both are reactions to distorted objectivity, what I calla phony objectivity. They are pieces of the same puzzle.""Gabler said, ""It's a form of humor that subverts media convention andreveals the pomposities and idiocies of politicians, but even morethe pomposities and idiocies of the media that covers thepoliticians.""All of which begs the question: What are programs like ""Larry KingLive"" and ""Prime Time Live"" hoping to accomplish by bringing newssatirists on board? Rocca's antics on ""Larry King Live"" during theconventions this summer, while occasionally funny, only highlightedthe staid nature of the broadcast, and for his part, King seemed notto know how to react, other than to laugh a bit too zealously atRocca's wisecracks.Shelley Ross, the producer of ""Prime Time Live"" who came up with theidea to do the musical news satire gag on her program, inspired by""That was the Week That Was"" in the 1960s, said she felt satire was aproper response to searching times. ""It represents a healthysociety,"" she said.For his part Rocca said he considered his satirical bits a kind ofpublic service. ""Television newscasts are so calcified and rigid, anydeparture from that is exhilarating,"" he said. ""And five minutes ofgood satire is a lot more useful than an hour on J.Lo's baby shower.""

""It's kind offrustrating, because we deal with it so much.""With us, really, there's no label you can apply; it's so difficultto.""And there's no need to, he added.Just as well.

D0920,D0920-B,"A New York-bound British Airways plane was forced to change course over the Atlantic and head back to London Wednesday after US authorities said they would not allow one of its passengers to land, the airline said.The Boeing 747, with 239 passengers aboard, was half-way to its destination when it decided to return to Heathrow Airport at 1115 GMT ""because of a passenger that the American authorities didn't want to land in New York,"" said a BA spokesman.A police spokesman in London said the male passenger had been released by police after being questioned for two hours.But a spokeswoman from the US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) said: ""There was a person traveling on a French passport who was a positive match with an anti-terrorism watch list.""Homeland security made the match by checking data transmitted after the flight departed from London,"" Yolanda Clark added.""As a precautionary measure, TSA contacted the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) and requested the aircraft be diverted to the nearest landing point to keep the plane from entering northeast corridor airspace. That airport would be Bangor, Maine,"" she said. ""BA corporate made the decision instead to return the flight to London."" A BA spokesman said there was ""no threat to the security of the aircraft and we took the decision to return to Heathrow.""An airline industry source who asked not to be named said it appears BA did not have the latest version of the no-fly list. This particular passenger was added in December.Last December 26, a Delta Airlines plane was diverted to a Florida military airport after US authorities found similarities between the name of a passenger and that of a wanted terrorist suspect.In November, An Air France Boeing 777 on a flight from Paris to Washington made an emergency landing in Bangor, Maine at the request of US authorities who wanted to question two passengers.In September, British singer Cat Stevens, who converted to Islam in 1977 and changed his name to Yusuf Islam, was barred from entering the United States on national security grounds. His plane was re-rerouted to Bangor as he was flying with his daughter to Nashville, Tennessee.
British religious and educational leaders were engaged Tuesday in debate over the growing trend of Islamic schools, after a chief government inspector warned they failed to prepare pupils for life in a diverse society.Leaders of Muslim organizations balked at chief English inspector David Bell's assessment that traditional Islamic education offered by some schools was not suitable for the country's children.But several officials at Islamic education bodies acknowledged the potential problem of students' social isolation, and said they were acting to address the problem.Bell, the head of the Office for Standards in Education, or Ofsted, raised concerns about religious-based schools in general, but singled out the rapidly-growing number of Islamic schools.""We must not allow our recognition of diversity to become apathy in the face of any challenge to our coherence as a nation,"" he said in a speech on Monday.""I worry that many young people are being educated in faith-based schools, with little appreciation of their wider responsibilities and obligations to British society.""Bell called on Islamic schools to promote ""tolerance and harmony"".The inspector's comments touched off sensitive debate in Britain, which boasts a wide range of secular and religiously-affiliated schools, including more than 100 Muslim schools in England.The Islamiya Primary School of north London, founded by the former folk singer Cat Stevens, now known as Yusuf Islam, became the first Muslim school in 1995 to win the public funding long awarded to Protestant and Catholic schools.Five of the Islamic schools are now state-run, with the rest independent.There are also more than 50 Jewish schools and about 100 Evangelical Christian schools.Iqbal Sacranie, secretary-general of the umbrella organization Muslim Council of Britain, said that while national cohesion was important it was ""highly irresponsible to suggest that the growth of Muslim faith schools poses a threat to 'our coherence as a nation'.""The school inspector's comments were denounced as ""Islamophobia"" by Dr. Mohamed Mukadam, chairman of the Association of Muslim Schools and principal of Leicester Islamic Academy in central England.But Idris Mears, director of the same association, said Bell raised valid concerns.""I don't think it's unfair of Mr. Bell to bring the matter up. Muslim schools are aware of it. They're putting positive actions into place,"" he said.Musleh Faradhi, head of the London East Academy, a new Islamic school, said he ""agreed 100 percent with Mr. Bell"".""You can't live in isolation, you have to interact with other people and understand other people and live with them, and if we don't teach our children that it would be a disservice,"" Faradhi told The Times newspaper.The school head argued, however, that the same warnings applied equally to Jewish and Christian students.Some Muslim leaders, including Sacranie, have called for state financing of more Islamic schools as a way of ensuring they maintain educational standards.Bell agreed, adding that schools which remained independent must be ""carefully but sensitively monitored"".About three percent of Muslim children in Britain attend Islamic schools, Sacranie said.According to Britain's last national census in 2001, 2.7 percent of the population, or just under 1.6 million people, identified themselves as Muslim, mainly originating from South Asian countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh.Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are dealt with separately from England in terms of education.
Yusuf Islam, the pop musician known as Cat Stevens until he became a Muslim convert, will perform a concert in Jakarta next week to raise cash for tsunami disaster victims.A statement on his website said Islam, who was deported from the United States last September out of being denied entry on ""security grounds"", would also open an office in Indonesia of his charity, Small Kindness.Islam, who had hits in the 1970s with ""Matthew and Son"", ""Peace Train"" and ""Wild World"", will headline a concert featuring local performers on January 31.""Like everyone else, I was so shaken by the enormity of this human tragedy, and the song just came without effort. It is my contribution towards helping to rebuild the broken spirits of the victims of the disaster,"" he said in the statement.He has also recorded a new song in response to the disaster. ""Indian Ocean"" features Magne Furuholmen of Norwegian group A-Ha and Neil Primrose of Britpop band Travis and is to be released next month.The record makes use of musical instruments the singer has eschewed since 1977 when he embraced Islam, however, he said it did not represent a revival of his pop career.""It's not a return to Cat Stevens, I see it more as a natural response to express my concern as a Muslim and as an artist; I believe both can exist side by side particularly when the cause is right,"" he said.Islam will be one of the most prominent international artists to perform in the world's largest Muslim-populated country for several months.A string of big name acts, including Norah Jones, Missy Elliott and Alicia Keys, have all cancelled shows due to security fears in the wake of deadly bombings blamed on Islamic extremists.Islam denied any link to terrorists last September when he was deported from the United States to Britain after his name appeared on a security watchlist when he was travelling on flight to Washington from London.
Pop singer turned Muslim activist Yusuf Islam, formerly Cat Stevens, said Tuesday he had obtained ""substantial"" damages against two British newspapers which alleged he had been involved in terrorism.In a statement released on his behalf, the 56-year-old, who sold 50 million records in the 1960s and 1970s, said he had also received apologies for the ""false and highly defamatory allegations"".The dispute was sparked by reports in the Sunday Times and Sun newspapers following the decision by US authorities in September 2004 to refuse Islam entry to the United States, on what was termed ""security grounds"".Islam, who gave up music and changed his name 30 years ago when he embraced the Muslim faith, has repeatedly denied any involvement in terrorism, or terrorist funding.Islam's settlement with the two papers saw them also agree to pay his legal costs and pledge not to repeat the allegations, his statement said.""It seems to be the easiest thing in the world these days to make scurrilous accusations against Muslims, and in my case it directly impacts on my relief work and damages my reputation as an artist,"" he said.""The harm done is often difficult to repair. However, I am delighted by the settlement, which helps vindicate my character and good name.""The damages would be given to relief projects in areas hit by the December 26 Indian Ocean tsunami, he added.
Yusuf Islam, the pop musician known as Cat Stevens until he converted to Islam 30 years ago, was set to release a new record on Monday in aid of tsunami-orphaned children in the Indonesian province of Aceh.""The tsunami disaster has changed the world in an extraordinary way and it requires an extraordinary response from everyone,"" said the 56-year-old, who sold 50 million records in the 1970s with hits such as ""Matthew and Son"", ""Peace Train"" and ""Wild World"".The new song in response to the disaster, ""Indian Ocean"", features Magne Furuholmen of Norwegian group A-Ha and Neil Primrose of Britpop band Travis. The British singer's own charity, Small Kindness, set up a regional office in Indonesia and will work on projects ""to keep families together"" by helping orphans in the predominantly-Muslim Aceh.""We try to find other family members who would look after the orphans and then keep the family together in that way and then pay them subsistence every month,"" he said on his website.The total number of tsunami victims is 273,435 dead or missing, 220,172 of them from Indonesia.
Two British newspapers said Tuesday they had paid unspecified damages to thesinger once known as Cat Stevens over articles suggesting he had links toterrorists.The musician, now known as Yusuf Islam, said The Sunday Times and The Sun hadpromised not to repeat the allegation and agreed to pay his legal costs and""substantial damages.""""It seems to be the easiest thing in the world these days to make scurrilousaccusations against Muslims, and in my case it directly impacts on my reliefwork and damages my reputation as an artist,"" he said in a statement.""The harm done is often difficult to repair. However, I am delighted by thesettlement, which helps vindicate my character and good name.""The Sunday Times and The Sun both confirmed they were making payments to Islambut declined to specify the amounts.""There is an agreed settlement,"" said Richard Caseby, managing editor of TheSunday Times. ""The Sunday Times always denied liability and we disagreed withCat Stevens' lawyers interpretation of the article, but we took a pragmatic viewof the case.""Janet Anderson, a spokeswoman for The Sun, said Islam's statement was correctbut declined to comment further.The stories appeared in the newspapers in October. The Sunday Times ran acorrection in November saying it had not intended to suggest Islam supportedterrorism.""We wish to make it clear that he is not and never has been involved in any suchactivities and we accept that he abhors all forms of terrorism,"" itsaid.The Sun also ran a correction.Islam was removed from a London-to-Washington flight in September becauseAmerican officials suspected him of links to terrorists, a charge he vehementlydenies.He said the U.S. government has still not told him what the accusation was basedon.Islam said he planned to use the money from the newspapers for aid projects hestarted to help children orphaned by the tsunami in Asia.
One of Britain's most senior Muslim leaders said Thursday that he was deniedentry to the United States without explanation, nearly a week after the deadlysubway and bus attacks in London.Dr. Zaki Badawi, head of the Muslim College, told The Associated Press he wasdenied entry when he arrived in New York on Wednesday. No explanation was given,he said.He had been invited to speak at the Chautauqua Institution in Chautauqua, NewYork, where he planned to give a talk under the title ""The Law and Religion inSociety.""A spokeswoman for the Customs and Border Protection office in New York said whenBadawi's flight from London to John F. Kennedy International Airport landedWednesday, customs agents had information that showed he was ""inadmissible.""Badawi then voluntarily withdrew his application for entry into the country,said Janet Rapaport.Rapaport said privacy rules prevented her from disclosing the specificinformation that was used to bar Badawi and said she did not know what databasethe information came from. She also said she did not know if last week'sterrorist bombings in London had anything to do with barringBadawi.A federal security official said Badawi was named on a U.S. terror watch list,but provided no further detail. The official spoke on condition of anonymitybecause of the sensitive nature of the information.The U.S. Embassy in London did not immediately respond to a request forcomment.No explanation was given for his exclusion, Badawi said in a telephoneinterview. ""The people I was speaking to were very junior people, and they arejust executing things they were told,"" Badawi said.""They were very very embarrassed, and I felt sorry for them.""Badawi said he had visited the United States many times before, the last time in2003.On Sunday, Badawi joined other British religious leaders in condemning the busand subway bombings. He appeared with the Archbishop of Canterbury, RowanWilliams, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Cormac MurphyO'Connor, Free Churches Moderator David Coffey and Chief Rabbi Sir JonathanSacks.Azim Nanji, director of the Institute of Ismaili Studies in London and aparticipant in the Chatauqua conference, said he was ""deeply saddened"" by theexclusion of a ""moderate voice.""""I felt it was very important that Americans should hear, particularly at thistime, a voice from a leading British Muslim who is well respected by the Britishgovernment, somebody they turn to for advice,"" Nanji said.""Inviting the Dr. Badawis of the world into that conversation is crucial,"" saidEboo Patel, founder and executive director of the Chicago-based Interfaith YouthCore, who said he had come to hear Badawi.""It's clear that a large segment of the Muslim community wants to be in apositive relationship with Western societies,"" Patel said.""When representatives of that segment, people who have been knighted by thequeen and are close advisers to the government, are rejected, it hurts ourefforts at building multi-faith societies and it gives grist to extremistMuslims who say, 'See, the West is against Islam, period.'""Tom Becker, president of the Chautauqua Institution south of Buffalo in westernNew York, said he didn't know why Badawi was barred. ""Whatever it was some kindof misinterpretation of something,"" he said.Badawi was given an honorary knighthood and in 2003 he was among the guests ofQueen Elizabeth II at a state banquet for U.S. President George W.Bush.Badawi said he was detained for about six hours.""America is a lovely country. There is no reason why it should behave likethat,"" Badawi said.In September, Yusuf Islam, formerly known as Cat Stevens, was ejected from theUnited States without explanation.Islam's flight from London was forced to make an emergency landing in Maine whenU.S. authorities discovered he was aboard.___Associated Press Writer Carolyn Thompson in Chautauqua, New York, contributed tothis report.

British foreign policy played a role in motivating the July 7 London bombings,former pop star Yusuf Islam said Tuesday.Islam, who as Cat Stevens had a string of hits in the 1960s and 70s, said anal-Qaida video claiming responsibility for the attacks and linking them toBritain's role in the Middle East showed that foreign policy ""was not the onlyfactor but it was a major contributory.""""At the same time we have to look at how the teaching of Islam has beendistorted,"" he added.Speaking at the opening of Cardiff University's Centre for the Study of Islam inthe U.K., Islam said schools should teach young Muslims the true meaning ofIslam to keep them away from extremist ideas.""Right now there is a more vital role for education to play in painting a truerpicture of Islam,"" he said. ""If you don't give it to the children in schools,anybody can give it to them on the streets or outside the normal environment forlearning.""He also said Muslims should do more to integrate with Britishsociety.""Coming to Islam from a Western background, I was slightly surprised early on bythe insular approach,"" he said. ""I can understand it because many feel insecureand perhaps they weren't appreciated or were misunderstood.""With a new generation of English-speaking Muslims we have an opportunity tobuild many more bridges between the great faiths,"" he added.Islam, whose songs include the 1971 hit ""Peace Train,"" was removed from aLondon-to-Washington flight in September and ejected from the United Statesbecause American officials identified him as a security risk. He says the U.S.government has still not told him the basis for the allegation.Last November, he was awarded the ""Man for Peace"" prize in Rome by former Sovietleader Mikhail Gorbachev, who praised him for charity work and standing by hisconvictions despite personal hardships.

D0921,D0921-A,"A son of late acting legend Marlon Brando was implicated in analleged plot by Michael Jackson to kidnap the boy who accused him ofchild molestation, a court heard Friday.The bombshell was dropped during a pre-trial hearing in Jackson'schild molestation case when prosecutors revealed they had recentlydiscovered documents linking Miko Brando with the alleged crime.Brando, 44, the son of the Oscar-winning movie giant, works as asecurity guard for the ""King of Pop"" and received a 20,000-dollarpetty cash payment from Jackson, prosecutor Ronald Zonen told JudgeRodney Melville.A record of the alleged December 2003 transaction was discovered indocuments seized in a search of the home of Jackson's personalassistant, the court heard.""Evidence of the movement of cash (is) consistent with count one ofthe indictment"" against Jackson, Zonen told the court as prosecutorsand Jackson's lawyers haggled over what evidence should be allowed attrial.Count one on the 10-count criminal indictment alleges that Jacksonand co-conspirators planned to abduct a child, to falsely imprisonsomeone and to extort someone.While details of the indictment remain secret under a strict gagorder in the case, the charges are thought to involve an alleged plotto abduct Jackson's young accuser, his younger brother and the boys'mother.But Jackson lawyer Robert Sanger, arguing that the financial recordshould not be seen by Jackson's trial jury, said the payment provednothing.""There is nothing unusual with someone like Michael Jackson, withsuch a large operation like Neverland, to have 20,000 dollars in cashdelivered to them for the purpose of running their daily affairs,""Sanger said.Jackson has denied 10 counts that include allegations that hemolested a 12-year-old boy at Neverland Ranch in February and Marchof last year.

A judge Thursday agreed to postpone the trial date for a lawsuitbrought by Michael Jackson and his former lawyer over the allegedsecret recording of them on a charter jet as the singer flew to bebooked on child molestation charges.Jackson and attorney Mark Geragos sued XtraJet Inc. in November,alleging they were videotaped without their knowledge on a flight toSanta Barbara so Jackson could surrender on the charges.Superior Court Judge Soussan G. Bruguera moved the trial date fromNovember to May 23 over the protests of XtraJet.The trial date was postponed due to the singer's criminal case, whichis scheduled for trial in January, and because Geragos isrepresenting Scott Peterson, the murder defendant accused of killinghis wife and their unborn son.Geragos is no longer representing Jackson, but was his lawyer inNovember when Jackson flew from Las Vegas to surrender.The lawsuit alleges that XtraJet ""intentionally and surreptitiouslyvideotaped and recorded"" Jackson and Geragos, including the recordingof ""privileged attorney-client communications.""XtraJet's attorney, Lloyd Kirschbaum called the lawsuit a ""publicitystunt.""The videotaping surfaced when representatives of XtraJet showed thevideo to several news organizations, claiming they found the tapesaboard one of their jets. They wanted to know whether it was legal todistribute or sell them.Jackson's attorney's won a temporary restraining order againstXtraJet that barred any release of the tapes.The judge also granted Jackson's request to remove his claims ofemotional distress. The change prevents attorneys from asking Jacksonany questions about his mental state, said Geragos' attorney, BrianKabateck.Jackson also wanted to avoid giving a deposition for the trial, butthe judge denied that request, Kabateck said.

""He continues to be my friend and close adviser.""A reason for the departure was not released. A message left afterbusiness hours at Cochran's Los Angeles office was not immediatelyreturned.In a separate statement, Mesereau denied rumors that there wasanimosity between him and Cochran. He called Cochran a friend,""brilliant lawyer, and a great credit to our profession.""Mesereau declined further comment when contacted by The AssociatedPress.In April, Jackson fired Mark Geragos and Benjamin Brafman, replacingthe two famous attorneys with Mesereau.

California's attorney general has urged the judge in the MichaelJackson child molestation case to reject a bid by the pop star toremove the Santa Barbara County prosecutor's office from the case.State Attorney General Bill Lockyer called the request ""baseless"" andsaid it was premised on ""conjecture and unfounded speculation.""Jackson's lawyers allege that District Attorney Tom Sneddon is""blinded by his zeal to convict Michael Jackson,"" creating a conflictof interest that would prevent Jackson from receiving a fair trial.Jackson has pleaded not guilty to child molestation, conspiracy andadministering an intoxicating agent, alcohol. Trial is set for Jan.31.In a motion filed Thursday, Lockyer responded that Jackson's lawyersfailed to show the district attorney's ""zeal"" in prosecuting thecharges stemmed from anything but an ""impartial consideration of thecase.""As with the majority of documents in the case, Lockyer's full motionwas sealed but an edited version was posted on the court's Web site.Jackson's attorney Steve Cochran, in a motion filed Oct. 8, accusedSneddon of having a vendetta against Jackson dating back to a 1993molestation investigation that never resulted in charges being filed.Jackson's attorneys were particularly concerned about what theydecried as Sneddon's ""smug"" and ""jocular"" manner during a newsconference in which he announced Jackson's arrest.Lockyer wrote that even if Sneddon had personal animosity towardJackson, that would not be enough to show a conflict of interest orwarrant his removal.""In sum, all of the defendant's baseless allegations are based onsurmise, conjecture and unfounded speculation,"" Lockyer wrote.

A former business associate of US pop singer Michael Jackson hasfiled a lawsuit against the entertainer for breaching contract, localmedia reported Wednesday.The lawsuit was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by Marc Schaffel,who is seeking 3 million US dollars for unpaid loans, cash advancesand producing fees.Schaffel claims that he helped Jackson make a pair of Fox televisionspecials to rebut a controversial TV documentary that took a criticallook at the singer's eccentric lifestyle.It was that documentary, aired on ABC and British television inFebruary 2003, that led to public fury about Jackson's dubiousrelationship with children and sparked calls for an investigationagainst Jackson.In the documentary, Jackson appeared on camera holding hands with a12-year-old boy with whom the singer admitted sharing his bedroom.Santa Barbara County prosecutors conducted search of Jackson'sNeverland ranch in the county and charged Jackson with molesting theboy shown in the documentary after a doctor tipped the police.Jackson, freed on a 3-million-dollar bail, is scheduled to standtrial on Jan. 31 on a 10-count indictment that charges him with childmolestation and conspiracy to kidnap.

","Michael Jackson's woes are many since his arrest for child molestation. He's suing XtraJet for videotaping his conversations with his lawyer. There's upheaval in his legal team since he fired two attorneys, hired one, and another took leave. Jackson's attorneys accused District Attorney Tom Sneddon of having a vendetta against him. Prosecutors alleged Jackson plotted to kidnap his accuser. In one week, Jackson was hit with two non-payment lawsuits. A rapper's video mocked Jackson and angered him, and he received a death threat. Investigators launched another search of Neverland Ranch, which frightened his children, and took a DNA sample.

D0922,D0922-A,"Attorney General John Ashcroft did not violate anti-lobbying lawswhen he gave a series of speeches last year promoting the anti-terrorPatriot Act, Justice Department internal investigators haveconcluded.The agency's inspector general, Glenn A. Fine, said the trips to 16cities in August and September of 2003 did not run afoul of lawsbarring executive branch officials from engaging in grass-rootslobbying or prohibiting the spending of government money onunauthorized ""publicity or propaganda.""""Neither the Anti-Lobbying Act nor the appropriations provisionprohibited the attorney general and the U.S. attorneys from makingpublic speeches conveying DOJ's view regarding the merits of thePatriot Act and discussing the DOJ's use of the law's provisions,""Fine said.The inspector general's conclusions were in a letter to Rep. JohnConyers of Michigan, senior Democrat on the House JudiciaryCommittee. The letter, dated Friday, was obtained Monday by TheAssociated Press.Conyers, who could not be reached immediately for comment, had askedFine to investigate after a Government Accountability Office reportshowed that Ashcroft's tour and a pro-Patriot Act Internet site hadcost more than $208,000 and also had involved activities by 80 of the93 U.S. attorneys.In his letter, Fine said that the attorney general and U.S.attorneys, as presidential appointees, are exempt from prohibitionsagainst executive branch lobbying of Congress. He also noted that areview of Ashcroft's speeches found he never urged audience membersto contact members of Congress on behalf of the Patriot Act.""In addition, given the DOJ's responsibility to enforce criminallaws, we do not believe they could be considered `purely partisan,'""Fine wrote.The Patriot Act, passed by Congress a few weeks after the Sept. 11,2001, terror attacks, gave federal law enforcement officials broaderpowers of surveillance and prosecution against suspected terrorists,their financiers and their sympathizers. Congress next year mustdecide whether to renew major parts of the law.

President George W. Bush on Monday urged Congress to reauthorize the USA PatriotAct, the Justice Department's widely criticized anti-terrorismlaw.""We must not allow the passage of time or the illusion of safety to weaken ourresolve in this new war"" on terrorism, Bush said at a swearing-in ceremony forAttorney General Alberto Gonzales at the Justice Department.The president also argued that the Senate must give his nominees for the federalbench up-or-down votes without delay to fill vacancies in thecourts.The Patriot Act, passed in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, bolsteredFBI surveillance and law-enforcement powers in terror cases, increased use ofmaterial witness warrants to hold suspects incommunicado for months, and allowedsecret proceedings in immigration cases.Civil liberties groups and privacy advocates lambasted the law because they saidit undermines freedom. But Bush said the act ""has been vital to our success intracking terrorists and disrupting their plans."" He noted that many key elementsof the law are set to expire at the end of the year and said Congress must actquickly to renew it.The Patriot Act was pushed by Gonzales' predecessor, John Ashcroft, who was inthe audience as Gonzales took his oath from Supreme Court Justice Sandra DayO'Connor. Bush lauded Ashcroft's tireless efforts to make America safer as heoversaw a drop in violent crime besides his counterterrorismwork.Gonzales, who served as White House counsel during the last four years, said hewould be a part of Bush's team but his first allegiance will be to theConstitution.""I am confident that in the days and years ahead we in the department will worktogether tirelessly to address terrorism and other threats to our nation and toconfront injustice with integrity and devotion to our highest ideals,"" Gonzalessaid.
The White House's homeland security adviser asked attorneys Thursday to helpfoster an honest debate over whether to reauthorize controversial anti-terrorlaws.Fran Townsend said White House support for extending the entire USA Patriot Act,which expires at the end of the year, is ""unequivocal."" That law, which waspassed in the wake of the Sept. 11 terror attacks, gives the government broadsurveillance and law enforcement powers in terror cases.""In the debate over the Patriot Act, we often hear about that delicate balancethat we rightly must make between freedom and security,"" Townsend told theAmerican Bar Association. ""I value that debate. The president values thatdebate. And it is important. What is equally important is that we not permitthis valuable tool to be caught up in unnecessary rhetoric.""""I encourage you to keep that debate honest,"" Townsend said. ""...We reallyshould try to divorce this from partisan politics.""Civil liberties groups and privacy advocates have lambasted the Patriot Actbecause they believe it undermines freedom.Critics says among the law's more controversial powers is the FBI's ability toobtain library and bookstore records in terrorism cases, and so-called ""sneakand peek"" search warrants in which agents need not immediately tell suspectstheir home or business had been searched.Townsend said she said she recently asked an audience to indicate how manypeople were concerned about the ""library records provision"" in theact.""Probably 70 percent of hands went up,"" Townsend said. ""And people were reallystunned that there is nowhere in the Patriot Act the mention of libraryrecords.""Section 215 of the Patriot Act does not specifically mention bookstores orlibraries, but permits secret warrants for ""books, records, papers, documentsand other items"" from businesses, hospitals or other organizations.Congress has rejected attempts to bar the FBI from using Patriot Act authorityto obtain library and bookstore records.
Conservative and liberal groups normally at each other's throats over thedirection of government are finding common cause in wanting to gut majorprovisions of the U.S. government's premier anti-terrorism law.The American Civil Liberties Union, the American Conservative Union, Americansfor Tax Reform and the Free Congress Foundation are among several groups thatformed a coalition _ Patriots to Restore Checks and Balances _ to lobby Congressto repeal three key provisions of the USA Patriot Act.Having people from all sides of the political spectrum working together willkeep politicians from calling Patriot Act opponents un-American or willing tohelp terrorists, which happened during the original debate over the law, thegroups said at a news conference Tuesday.""We don't want this argument to be obscured by those who would suggest thatanyone who is for more and more government power is somehow on the side of theright, and those who are against it or are skeptical of such grants are on theside of the wrong,"" said David Keene of the American Conservative Union. ""Thisis an important question of all Americans on the left, the right or in themiddle.""For liberals, partnering with conservatives will ensure that theRepublican-dominated Congress and President George W. Bush's administration willhave to listen to their concerns, said Laura W. Murphy, outgoing director of theACLU's Washington legislative office.The coalition wants Congress to repeal or let expire prosecutors' Patriot Actability to easily obtain records in terrorism-related cases from businesses andother entities, including libraries; the provision that allows ""sneak and peek""searches conducted without a property owner's or resident's knowledge and withwarrants delivered afterward; and what they called an overbroad definition of""terrorists"" that could include non-terrorism suspects.The coalition highlighted the provisions in a letter to the president which alsosaid, ""We agree that much of the Patriot Act was necessary to provide lawenforcement with the resources they need to defeat terrorism.""Justice Department spokeswoman Tasia Scolinos said the law ""contains strongcivil liberties safeguards and has a proven track record of being an effectivetool in the war on terror.""Any suggestion of civil liberties violations is an effort to shift the focus ofthe discussion away from the facts,"" Scolinos said. ""There have been no verifiedcivil liberties violations filed against the Patriot Act.

Conservative libertarians launched a campaign Tuesdayto persuade President Bush and Congress to fix the sections of theanti-terrorism Patriot Act that they say intrude on privacy and harmcivil liberties.Long wary of the act's enhanced police powers, the conservativesannounced they had formed the organization Patriots for Checks andBalances with the liberal American Civil Liberties Union in time forhearings in the Republican-controlled Congress next month on whetherit should renew 16 Patriot Act provisions that expire at year's end.At a news conference Tuesday, ACLU Washington director Laura Murphyunderscored the importance of raising the profile in the debate ofsuch prominent conservatives as Grover Norquist of Taxpayers United,David Keene of the American Conservative Union and Paul Weyrich of theFree Congress Foundation.``Given the number of folks in this room wearing elephant lapelpins, I don't think the administration can easily discount ourmessage,'' said Murphy, referring to the symbol of the RepublicanParty.Bush and new Attorney General Alberto Gonzales have said in recentspeeches that one of their priorities this year is to wincongressional renewal of all expiring sections of the controversialanti-terrorism law, enacted just weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorattacks.Bob Barr, the group's chair and a former Republican representativefrom Georgia who voted for the act in 2001, said the sunsetting of theprovisions and the hearings in the House and Senate provide a ``uniqueopportunity'' to add checks and balances to the act.In a letter sent to the president Tuesday, Barr and his group askedBush ``to reconsider your unqualified support'' for three specificprovisions, only one of which is set to expire withoutreauthorization.Those are the so-called ``sneak-and-peek'' Section 213, whichallows agents to enter a place without first notifying the owner;Section 215, which permits agents to get business and library recordsmore easily; and Section 802, which broadly defines terrorists andterrorism.Barr and his group said that they find hope in Gonzales' remarksthat he will be more open to discussion that his predecessor, JohnAshcroft, who not only staunchly defended the act but sought to expandit.Justice Department spokeswoman Tasia Scolinos said her agency ``hasspearheaded the call for active discussion and meaningful dialogue onthe reauthorization of the Patriot Act.''The ACLU has worked with conservative libertarians for the pastdecade with to insist on the inclusion of judicial review and othersafeguards for privacy in anti-terrorism laws.Last year, the ACLU paid Barr $150,000 to be a consultant andlobbyist, Senate records show. Barr says he also consults for theAmerican Conservative Union.
In the shaky, uncertain weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks, Congresspassed an anti-terrorism bill that gave the government broad powersto peer into the lives of Americans. It's time -- past time -- torein in the excesses of the USA Patriot Act.Last week, a federal judge in Manhattan struck down a provision inthe 342-page act that enables federal authorities -- without courtreview -- to force Internet service providers to turn over personalinformation about subscribers and their online activities.The provision also bars the companies from disclosing that they'vebeen subpoenaed via a pre-Patriot Act instrument known as a ""nationalsecurity letter.""U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero ruled that the provision violatesthe Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches andthe First Amendment protections against prior restraint on speech.The challenge was raised by the American Civil Liberties Union onbehalf of an unnamed Internet service provider.Attorney General John Ashcroft said the Justice Department wouldappeal the ruling. ""We believe the act to be completely consistentwith the United States Constitution,"" he told The Associated Press.Judge Marrero drew a far different conclusion, saying the provisionand the latitude it gives the government to conduct uncheckedsearches have ""no place in an open society.""For the long-term health of our nation, it's essential to strike amore sensitive balance between the pursuit of security and thepreservation of our basic freedoms.As the judge points out, ""Sometimes a right, once extinguished, maybe gone for good.""
A senior Bush administration official defended the Patriot Act onTuesday as a ""smart, ordinary and constitutional"" tool in fightingterrorism and rejected attacks on it as rash and misinformed.The comments by James B. Comey Jr., the deputy attorney general,coming in a speech before the American Bar Association on the thirdanniversary of the passage of the Patriot Act, offered a preview ofwhat is likely to be a fierce fight in Congress next year over thefuture of the law.With key elements of the Patriot Act set to expire at the end of2005, President Bush has urged Congress to renew the law as avaluable weapon in tracking terrorists. But liberals and someconservatives in Congress have repeatedly raised concerns aboutwhether the law has given the federal government too much power andhave urged a go-slow approach in considering whether it should berenewed in its entirety.In the face of frequent attacks on the law, Bush administrationofficials have mounted an increasingly aggressive and public defenseof the legislation and railed against what they regard as distortionsabout what it does. Comey's speech came on the same day that AttorneyGeneral John Ashcroft, in an op-ed piece in The Wall Street Journal,called the Patriot Act ""an indispensable tool"" in fighting terrorismand said it ""is often portrayed in an outright false light.""Critics challenged the Justice Department's aggressive defense of thelaw. ""It's ironic that the same Department of Justice that has misledthe public about the Patriot Act would complain that the public hasbeen misled,"" said Gregory Nojeim, associate director of the AmericanCivil Liberties Union's Washington legislative office.Comey's own defense of the Patriot Act was significant both becauseof his current position as the second-ranking official at the JusticeDepartment and because of his prospects for a promotion.Many officials inside and out of the Justice Department say they donot expect Ashcroft to return for a second term as attorney generalif Bush is re-elected, and Comey is thought to be on the short listof possible successors.In his speech to the bar association, Comey defended two aspects ofthe Patriot Act that he said have come under unfair attack: aprovision that allows authorities to conduct so-called ""sneak andpeek"" searches without immediately notifying the target; and aseparate section allowing them to demand business records on terrorand espionage suspects from bookstores, libraries and otherinstitutions.But civil liberties advocates, who have pushed for the repeal ofsecret intelligence warrants under the library records provision,argue that federal authorities can already use standard criminalwarrants at libraries if they have evidence linking a suspect toterrorism.
President Bush on Monday urged the nation to staythe course in its ""urgent mission"" to fight terrorism, andhe called on Congress to move quickly to extend sweepinglaw enforcement powers under the USA Patriot Act.""We must not allow the passage of time or the illusionof safety to weaken our resolve in this new war,""Bush said in a speech at the Justice Department. ""Toprotect the American people, Congress must promptly renew all provisionsof the Patriot Act this year.""The president's remarks came at the formal swearing-in of his friendand longtime adviser, Alberto R. Gonzales, as the nation's 80thattorney general. Gonzales won Senate confirmation 11 days ago bya vote of 60 to 36 after a sharp debatethat focused on the administration's terrorism policies and their impacton the treatment of prisonersBush built his re-election campaign last year around the assertion thathe was the candidate best able to defend the countryagainst another terrorist attack. In taking on the subject ofthe Patriot Act once again, he showed no signs ofbacking away from that approach.A number of measures in the act that expand the government'sability to conduct secret surveillance and use other law enforcementpowers will expire at the end of the year unlessCongress extends them. Many Democrats and some Republicans have voicedskepticism or outright opposition to an extension, and some lawmakershave offered competing proposals that would restrict the ability offederal agents to demand records from libraries and use otherpowers granted by the act.Bush's renewed call for an extension met with skepticism from theAmerican Civil Liberties Union, which called on ""cooler heads"" inCongress to scrutinize and fine-tune the law to meet civilliberties concerns.""The president and the attorney general must realize that security andliberty are not -- and cannot -- be mutually exclusive,""the group said in a statementThe White House, however, has signaled that it will veto anyeffort by Congress to rein in counterterrorism powers.Bush, speaking at the Justice Department's Great Hall before an audienceof visiting officials and Justice Department employees, said that Gonzaleswas joining them in ""an urgent mission -- to protectthe United States from another terrorist attack.""Gonzales echoed that theme, pledging that department employees would ""work togethertirelessly to address terrorism and other threats to our nation,and to confront injustice with integrity and devotion to ourhighest ideals.""
Washington -- An unusual left-right coalition opened a campaign Tuesday tosharply curtail controversial provisions of the USA Patriot Act, showingthat Congress and President Bush face a pointed debate overrenewing the law enacted just 45 days after the Sept.11, 2001, terrorist attacks.It was a Washington rarity to see the American Civil LibertiesUnion line up with conservative lions like David Keefe ofthe American Conservative Union and former Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.But they were among those at a Washington press conferenceheld to assail such Patriot Act provisions as those allowinglaw enforcement agents to look at library users' records orto conduct unannounced ""sneak-and-peek"" searches on homes or private offices.""It is not, and never should be necessary, to surrender ourrights under the Bill of Rights to fight the waron terrorism,"" said Barr, who as a House member votedfor the Patriot Act, which passed overwhelmingly in the Houseand provoked only one dissenting Senate vote.Barr, leader of the new group dubbed Patriots to Restore Checksand Balances, concedes that the group faces a difficult fightin making changes to the 4-year-old law. The law's supporters,many of whom point out that the United States hasn'tbeen hit by another terrorist attack since Sept. 11, sayit has proven effective and that many of the complaintsoffered by civil libertarians have nothing to do with theact's provisions.Key provisions of the bill are scheduled to expire Dec. 31,so Congress must deal with the issue this year. TheSenate and House Judiciary Committees plan Patriot Act hearings startinglater in the spring.Instead of seeking wholesale changes, the coalition is focusing on threeof the law's most-controversial provisions. And rather than push fortheir repeal, the group wants the wording clarified to establishthat the intention is to fight terrorists -- not letlaw enforcement agencies engage in fishing expeditions or silence dissent.The group wants the section giving access to library, medical andfirearm-ownership records modified to require that law enforcement officials presentevidence to a federal judge supporting a link with suspectedterrorism before warrants are served.The group wants similar limits on the provision allowing secret searchesof homes, businesses and personal property.And group members want the language of the section that allowssurveillance of protests rewritten to require a definite connection withsuspected terrorism.""These provisions sweep far too broadly. Whenever people ram through legislationwith broad and vague authority, it eventually will be abused,""Barr said.""If the Constitution stands for anything, it's that government does nothave the power to peer into our private lives withoutevidence of wrongdoing,"" said Laura Murphy, of the ACLU's Washingtonlegislative office.Grover Norquist, the conservative activist who heads Americans for Tax Reform,noted the unlikely coalition of conservatives and the ACLU.""For too long, conservatives assumed it was someone else's job"" toprotect civil liberties, Norquist said.So far, almost 400 local and state governments have passed resolutionsopposing the act, or some of its provisions, the ACLUsays.President Bush campaigned last year in favor of renewing the PatriotAct, and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has indicated he doesn'tfavor any changes except, perhaps, to increase the government's powersin a few instances.""Debate about government exercise of powers that might infringe upon privacyor civil liberties, I think that's an appropriate debate,"" hetold a recent meeting of the National Association of Counties.""But it's got to be a real debate, one basedon facts. And I've yet to hear a strong argumentas to why the Patriot Act should not be reauthorized.""At a recent House hearing, FBI Director Robert Mueller praised thePatriot Act and said he'd like to see it expandedto include administrative subpoena power in terrorism cases, something theFBI has in organized crime and health- care fraud investigations.The subpoenas, which require recipients to disclose information, are signedby an FBI agent without prior judicial or grand juryreview.Mueller said the Patriot Act is a key part of theFBI's new post-Sept. 11 approach.""We have changed the way we address terrorism since Sept. 11to ensure that we have exploited every possibility to gatherintelligence about the motivations, the capabilities of these individuals orgroups in our communities before we go ahead and makethe arrest,"" he told a House panel.
","The Bush administration began an offensive in 2005 to persuade Congress to renew the Patriot Act, parts of which would expire in 2006. That law, passed after September 11, gave broad powers to government agencies to obtain information for fighting terrorism. They argued the Patriot Act has prevented further attacks. A coalition of conservatives and liberals organized to demand changes, believing the Act endangered individual freedom. The groups challenged provisions giving access to library, medical and firearm-ownership records; allowing secret searches; and allowing surveillance of protests. Earlier, a judge disallowed forcing Internet providers to turn over records. ","The Patriot Act included major sections that expire in 2005 if not renewed by Congress. The Bush administration calls for complete renewal, but liberals and some conservatives maintain that the law gives the federal government too much power. Bush threatens to veto any congressional weakening of the Act. The specific sections are targeted by an unusual left-right coalition. The sections attacked are: the one permitting easy access to records in terrorism-related cases; the provision for ""sneak and peek"" secret searches before a warrant is presented; and an overbroad definition of ""terrorists"" that could include non-terrorist suspects. ","Weeks after 911 Congress passed the USA Patriot Act. The Act expanded Federal law enforcement officials' surveillance and prosecution power against suspected terrorists. Key elements of the Act were to expire at the end of 2005. Congress had to decide whether to renew them. The Bush administration argued that the Act had kept America safe and sought to retain all elements. Opponents argued that the Act undermined freedom and gave the federal government too much power. Groups opposed to the renewal of the Act formed a coalition, Patriots to Restore Checks and Balances, to lobby Congress to repeal key provisions. ","President Bush, the outgoing Attorney General John Ashcroft and his deputy, James Comfey, have promoted the Patriot Act. The President and incoming Attorney General Gonzales have called for it extension. Ashcroft's speeches promoting of the Act have not violated anti-lobbying rules. The liberal American Civil Liberties Union and conservative libertarian groups have joined forces to oppose giving government access to library and medical records. A US district judge ruled that a provision of the Patriot Act that enabled federal authorities to force Internet service providers to provide subscriber information violated the First and Fourth Amendments. "
D0922,D0922-B,"As Attorney General Alberto Gonzales prepares his defense of expiring provisionsof the Patriot Act, the anti-terrorism law's opponents hope to persuade Congressnot to extend what they say are intrusions into Americans' lives.Gonzales is to testify Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee and gobefore the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. FBI Director Robert Mueller,who also wants full reauthorization of the Patriot Act, will join Gonzales forhis Senate appearance.On the same day Gonzales will speak to the Senate committee, Sens. Larry Craig,an Idaho Republican, and Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, plan to reintroducelegislation designed to curb major parts of the Patriot Act that they say wenttoo far.""Cooler heads can now see that the Patriot Act went too far, too fast and thatit must be brought back in line with the Constitution,"" said Gregory Nojeim,associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Washingtonlegislative office.The Patriot Act is the post-Sept. 11 law that expanded the government'ssurveillance and prosecutorial powers against suspected terrorists, theirassociates and financiers. Most of the law is permanent, but 15 provisions willexpire in December unless renewed by Congress.Among them is a particularly controversial section permitting secret warrantsfor ""books, records, papers, documents and other items"" from businesses,hospitals and other organizations.That section is known as the ""library provision"" by its critics. While it doesnot specifically mention bookstores or libraries, critics say the governmentcould use it to subpoena library and bookstore records and snoop into thereading habits of innocent Americans.That criticism has led five states and 375 communities in 43 states to passanti-Patriot Act resolutions, the ACLU says.Even some Republicans are concerned. Senate Judiciary Chairman Arlen Specter, aPennsylvania Republican, has suggested it should be tougher for federalofficials to use that provision.Does ""this really incorporate the kind of constitutional guarantees thatAmericans have come to expect?"" said David Keene, chairman of the AmericanConservative Union.Gonzales already has agreed to two minor changes to the provision, and isexpected to address those Tuesday, a Justice Department official said oncondition of anonymity so as not to pre-empt Gonzales' testimony.He will support giving someone who receives a secret warrant under the provisionthe right to consult a lawyer and challenge the warrant in court, and will backslightly tightening the standard for issuing subpoenas, the officialsaid.Neither of the changes addresses the central concern of critics, which is thatit allows the government to seize records of people who are not suspectedterrorists or spies.Gonzales and his predecessor, John Ashcroft, say the Patriot Act is a criticallaw enforcement tool that has helped protect the country from another terroristattack. However, Gonzales has shown a willingness to discuss possiblemodifications, saying in January he would consider Specter's suggestion to makeit harder for officials to obtain warrants for books, records and other readingmaterial.""The attorney general has said before that if there are suggestions that can addto the government's ability to root out terrorists and aid us in the war onterror, he will certainly work with Congress to do that,"" Gonzales spokesmanKevin Madden said. ""He looks forward to a healthy discussion about thoseprovisions.""But Gonzales wants the entire Patriot Act renewed and has spent significant timetalking up the law in preparation for his possibly contentious appearancesbefore Congress.""I am willing to support improvements to our laws that make America safer. WhatI will not support are changes in the law that would make America morevulnerable to terrorist attacks,"" he told a conference in February.Critics say the law allows the government to target certain groups, but theJustice Department counters that no Patriot Act-related civil rights abuses havebeen proven.Just in case, Craig and Durbin plan to ask Congress Tuesday to curb bothexpiring and nonexpiring parts of the Patriot Act, including the expiring""library"" provision and ""sneak and peek"" or delayed notification warrants. Thosewarrants _ which will not expire in December _ allow federal officials to searchsuspects' homes without telling them until later.The Justice Department said federal prosecutors have asked for 155 such warrantssince 2001.Gonzales also notes that the law has been used in non-terrorism cases. Butnon-terrorism uses are part of what concerns Grover Norquist, president ofAmericans for Tax Reform.""Many of us remember what happened with RICO,"" the Racketeer Influenced andCorrupt Organizations Act, Norquist said. ""It was originally passed and theywere going to go after organized crime figures in dark shirts and they ended upusing it against pro-life demonstrators years later.""___On the Net:
Critics of the USA Patriot Act called for the Senate to temper theanti-terrorism law's provisions that let police conduct secret searches ofpeople's homes or businesses, but defenders say since no abuses have beendocumented the law should be renewed.The Bush administration wants Congress to make permanent all 15 provisions ofthe law that expire at the end of the year, some of which have aroused civilliberties concerns among liberals and conservatives. The law's nationalstandards for what are sometimes known as ""sneak and peek"" searches arepermanent.Sens. Larry Craig, an Idaho Republican, and Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat,told the Senate Judiciary Committee that while they cannot show any specificabuses, the anti-terrorism law is written in a way that could allowabuses.""Our law cannot be written for the best and the brightest. They must alsoanticipate enforcement from the worst and the weakest,"" said Craig, who ispushing a bill with Durbin that would scale back some of the Patriot Act'spowers.Critics of the law want Congress to pass the SAFE Act to limit the Patriot Actin several ways, including requiring government officials to inform suspectsabout the ""sneak and peek"" searches within seven days if a judge does notintervene. The current law does not specify when the government has to informsuspects about the secret search.""We do not want to end the Patriot Act. We want to mend the Patriot Act,"" Durbinsaid.Sen. Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican, defended the anti-terrorism law, sayingthat since no one can come up with specific abuses, the expiring provisionsshould be renewed.""In this particular area because there has been no problems, it seems to be methat the assumption underlying the sunset provisions ought to move forward,which is, there being no problems, the act ought to be reauthorized,"" Kylsaid.The Justice Department has said that the courts authorized 155 delayed searchwarrants under the Patriot Act through January.

When Congress enacted the Patriot Act after the Sept.11 attacks, it put the Justice Department on a short leash, mandatingthat many of the new powers in the act would last only four yearsunless renewed by Congress.Now, as lawmakers are debating an administration proposal to makethose provisions permanent, Republicans and Democrats are wonderingwhether they should retain the ``sunset'' provisions to ensure adegree of Justice Department accountability.The issue is apt to become an important part of the debate asCong Congress every couple of yearsand justify the provisions,'' a spokesman said.``There seems to be strong bipartisan support for keeping sunsetsin the Patriot Act, even after Congress decides what parts will bereauthorized and what parts will be amended,'' said Gregory Nojeim,associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union legislativeoffice.``It appears that members believe that the sunset helps encouragethe Department of Justice to be more forthcoming with informationabout how the Patriot Act is being used,'' he added.Indeed, the uncertain fate of the law has resulted in a burst ofdetailed new information from the Justice Department about how it hasbeen used.At a Senate hearing Tuesday, Gonzales released declassifiedinformation showing how often the department had used powerful newtools under the law. These included provisions covering the collectionof a wide range of business records, and search warrants that allowthe government to delay notifying the target of a warrant untilsometimes weeks or months after the search has taken place, a practicecritics call ``sneak and peek.''The department also gave Congress a 69-page analysis of how theexpiring provisions have operated..``I think it's a strong record of success. I think that the act hasbeen effective. I think that the department has acted responsibly,''Gonzales said.
With five state legislatures in revolt against the PatriotAct, Congress begins reconsideration of the sweeping anti-terrorism legislation Tuesdayamid clamor for changes from the political right and left.Last week, Montana joined four other states that have passed resolutionsurging Congress to curb the new powers hastily granted tofederal law enforcement agencies six weeks after the Sept. 11,2001, terrorist attacks.This latest resolution to restrict the Patriot Act ""protects our statesrights and is what true Republicans in every 'red state'should be doing,"" said Rick Maedje, a GOP member ofthe Montana House of Representatives.However, similar measures urging restrictions on the Patriot Act have alsopassed in the 'blue states' of Vermont, Maine and Hawaii-- which tend to vote Democratic in national elections --as well as in the 'red states' of Alaska andMontana. A coalition to rein in the Patriot Act isheaded by former Rep. Bob Barr, a conservative Georgia Republican,and has members ranging from the American Civil Liberties Unionon the ideological left to Americans For Tax Reform onthe right.""It's our number one legislative priority,"" Anthony D. Romero, executive directorof the ACLU, said Monday.Portions of the act will expire at the end of thisyear if Congress does not vote to renew them, asPresident Bush has requested. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales will beginmaking the administration's case to Congress this week, testifying beforethe Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday and the House JudiciaryCommittee on Wednesday. Hearings are likely to continue into thesummer before any measures come up for a vote.""I expect these national hearings to be very thorough and I'mcertain there will be probing questions from senators on bothsides of the aisle,"" said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., chairmanof the Senate Judiciary Committee.""There are few issues that are more important to this committeeand the American people than protecting our citizen's precious civilrights and civil liberties while continuing the battle against terror,""said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., the ranking minority member onthe House committee.The Patriot Act gave the federal government greater powers of surveillance,investigation and prosecution to use against suspected terrorists and theirenablers. However, opponents said it has also been used tobypass the constitutional requirements for ""probable cause"" in issuing warrantsin ordinary criminal investigations and in other manners unrelated toterrorism.""Despite the secrecy that permeates the Patriot Act, it's clear thatit has been abused and misused,"" said Romero in aletter sent Monday to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., a memberof the Judiciary Committee. ""The government has committed these transgressionswithout apology or regret and has simultaneously sought to expandthe powers granted under the Patriot Act.""In the letter, the ACLU said the act had been usedto carry out a secret search of the home ofBrandon Mayfield, a Muslim attorney in Portland, Ore., who waswrongly suspected of complicity in the 2004 terrorist bombing ofa train in Madrid, Spain. The ACLU also charged abuseor misuse of the act in keeping Tariq Ramadan, a""widely respected Muslim scholar,"" from entering the United States andfor prosecuting Sami al-Hussayen, a Muslim student in Idaho, forposting Internet links to materials the Justice Department deemed ""objectionable.""Sens. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, and Richard Durbin, D-Ill., plan to introducethe ""Safety and Freedom Enforcement"" or SAFE Act on Tuesday,aimed at eliminating some of the Patriot Act provisions thatopponents view as most extreme. It would deal with theso-called ""sneak and peek"" provision, which allows federal agents tosecretly search people's homes and businesses without any deadline ongiving notice that the intrusion had taken place.The SAFE Act would also curb a part of the PatriotAct that allows federal agents to collect personal data onordinary Americans -- such as their medical history, books theycheck-out at the library and goods they purchase -- withoutevidence that the citizen is connected to terrorism. And itmodifies a section that opponents say defines ""terrorism"" too broadly,making law-abiding critics of federal policy subject to investigation.(Story can end here; Optional add follows)In addition to the five state legislatures, the ACLU said 375county and city governments in 43 states have passed resolutionswarning against threats that the Patriot Act could pose tocivil liberties. In a March 7 speech to county officials,Gonzales contended that some of these votes were based on""misinformation or a lack of information.""""The act has helped us considerably in the war on terrorism,""Gonzales said.Romero said the ACLU has never opposed the Patriot Act inits entirety.

WASHINGTON - Justice Department investigators nearly doubled the rate at whichthey used a controversial new search-and-seizure power, allowed under theUSA PATRIOT Act, during the past 22 months, according todata released by the Bush administration Monday on the eveof congressional testimony by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.Formally called delayed-notification searches, the warrants are known as ""sneak andpeek"" because they allow investigators to search a person's homeor business and to seize property without disclosing for weeksor months that they were there. Although investigators must convincea judge that there is a ""reasonable suspicion"" that theinvestigation would be harmed if the subject were notified, nojudge has ever denied a request for those searches.Although the warrants are codified in a law enacted to fightterrorism, they are not limited to terrorism investigations. And, accordingto the Justice Department, investigators have increasingly resorted to thepower since the Patriot Act became law shortly after theterrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.The Justice Department said Monday that the power was a valuablelaw enforcement tool for a ""wide spectrum of criminal investigations,including those involving terrorism and drugs."" But the American CivilLiberties Union said the release ""confirms our worst fears"" thatthe use of the law is expanding beyond terrorism investigations,and called for greater oversight.The Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday intends to question Gonzales and FBIDirector Robert S. Mueller III about how the Justice Departmenthas been using its Patriot Act powers, setting the stagefor a year of political debate over whether to makethe Patriot Act permanent or to scale it back.In May 2003, the Justice Department released its initial data onhow often it had used the search power, covering Oct.26, 2001, to April 1, 2003. During those roughly 17months, it asked for and got sneak-and-peek warrants 47 times,or about 2.7 times a month. According to data releasedMOnday, investigators sought the warrants 108 times in 22 months- from April 1, 2003, to Jan. 21, 2005, arate of 4.9 times a month.The Justice Department said in its statement that sneak-and-peek searches area very small fraction of the total number of searchwarrants it uses in its investigations. The searches allow agentsto gather evidence against subjects without tipping them off thatthey are under scrutiny - something that could prompt themto flee, destroy evidence, or menace a witness.""The department estimates that court-approved delayed-notification warrants represent less than 0.2percent of the search warrants utilized by law enforcement,"" thestatement said.The law also allows the clandestine seizure of property when ajudge finds that it is ""reasonably necessary."" The Justice Departmentsaid it has sought such authorization 45 times since thePatriot Act became law.But the ACLU said the ""highly intrusive"" searches ""are being usedprimarily outside of the terrorism arena. Congress must insist onreceiving more detailed information on each of these searches andwhy each was necessary.""Delayed-notification search warrants are among the enhanced police powers included inthe Patriot Act. Although judges have had the authority toapprove no-notification warrants in certain criminal cases for decades, thepower did not become codified until the Patriot Act.The ACLU and other critics have called for greater checks onthe power, including stricter standards for when and how ajudge may authorize sneak-and-peek searches. According to the Justice Departmentdata, no judge has ever denied a law enforcement requestfor such search-and-seizure warrants.Gonzales's and Mueller's testimony Tuesday before the committee will mark thestart of the Bush administration's campaign to persuade Congress tomake the entire Patriot Act permanent this year. Several ofits provisions are due to expire at the end ofthe year, although the sneak-and-peek"" search is not one ofthem.A coalition of liberal and conservative libertarians plan to call Tuesdayfor the passage of the ""Safety and Freedom Enhanced Act,""which would amend several of the Patriot Act's provisions toprovide for greater safeguards and oversight on when and howthe powers are used.Arlen Specter, chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee and a Republicanof Pennsylvania, said Monday that reauthorizing ""certain key provisions"" ofthe Patriot Act is necessary, but he left the dooropen to scaling it back, contending that he is ""mindfulof the strong criticism which is coming from both theright and left of the political spectrum.""Democratic Senate aides said Gonzales will also face questioning regarding FBIagents who allegedly witnessed ""torture techniques"" during interrogations of ""enemycombatants"" at the Guantanamo Bay Navy Base in 2002.
WASHINGTON - Attorney General Alberto Gonzales signaled Tuesday that the Bushadministration is open to compromise with civil liberties advocates onkey provisions of the USA Patriot Act as it comesup for renewal this year, shifting away from the hard-linestance of his predecessor, John Ashcroft.Gonzales, testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday, also revealed thatthe FBI had used Patriot Act surveillance powers to monitoran Oregon lawyer who last year was wrongly jailed for14 days as a ""material witness"" in the March 2004Madrid train bombings.And Gonzales disclosed that FBI agents have used Patriot Act searchwarrants 35 times to obtain business records deemed relevant toa terrorism investigation. In May 2004, Ashcroft publicly said suchwarrants had never been used.None of those 35 warrants were used on libraries, but FBIDirector Robert Mueller said some libraries have voluntarily provided information,such as data from computers used by a suspect forInternet access. Librarian groups have been sharp critics of thePatriot Act, arguing that people's reading habits should be protectedfrom government surveillance.""As Congress considers whether to renew these provisions, I am opento suggestions for clarifying and strengthening the act,"" Gonzales said.""I look forward to meeting with those both inside andoutside of Congress who have expressed concerns about the act.But let me be clear that I will not supportany proposal that would undermine our ability to combat terrorismeffectively.""During his tenure, Ashcroft threatened that President Bush would use hisfirst veto if Congress modified the Patriot Act, and membersfrom both parties criticized the former attorney general for failingto answer questions about how the Justice Department was usingthe law.Gonzales' disclosures about how the Patriot Act has been used andhis willingness to entertain revisions of the law were cheeredby members of both parties.""I am heartened by your opening statement, Attorney General, about beingopen to suggestions and ideas,"" said Senator Richard J. Durbinof Illinois, the Democratic whip. ""It is a grand departurefrom your predecessor, and I think it is the rightspirit for us to address the Patriot Act.""Congress passed the Patriot Act shortly after Sept. 11, 2001. Mostof it is dedicated to sharing information between law-enforcement andspy agencies. But its provisions granting FBI agents greater powerto search people's computers, telephones, and homes have become powerfulsymbols to civil libertarians.Sixteen provisions of the Patriot Act are due to expire atthe end of 2005, and Bush has said it isa priority for Congress to make them permanent. Testimony byGonzales and Mueller Tuesday opened a new season of politicaldebate over the measure.""In the United States, with our deep tradition for civil rightsand constitutional law, that concern for security has to bebalanced by due regard for civil rights,"" said Senator ArlenSpecter, Republican of Pennsylvania and chairman of the Judiciary Committee.He added later, ""This is a very knotty problem. Ithink there has to be some give on some ofthese authorities.""Meanwhile, Senator Larry Craig, an Idaho Republican, and Durbin filed abipartisan bill Tuesday that would provide more public notification andscrutiny of Justice Department actions under the Patriot Act.Among other changes, their measure would require that most people benotified of secret search warrants against them within seven daysof the search. It also would make certain that nonviolentpolitical protests are not covered by the act.""Clearly the civil liberties of this country are its strength,"" Craigsaid. ""Out of fear, we should not run from thoseprinciples, nor should we deny ourselves those rights and thoseprotections.""Libertarians have also suggested carving out exceptions for libraries and bookstoresfrom the ""business records"" that may be sought under thePatriot Act. But Gonzales argued that the power should bepreserved, even as he stressed that the warrants have sofar been used only for driver's license, credit card, andtelephone records, not reading lists.""It should not be held against us that we've exercised, inmy judgment, restraint,"" Gonzales said.Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, expressed impatience with the argumentsby librarians, cutting off Mueller when the FBI director wasdiscussing how to balance security and the ""sanctity"" of libraries.""A library doesn't have any sanctity,"" Sessions said, adding that librarians""think it's sanctified, I'll admit. I just disagree that itdeserves special protection.""Gonzales also argued against a proposal to raise the standard ofproof before a judge may authorize a search of businessrecords.Nevertheless, the attorney general said he would be happy to discusscompromises. He offered two proposals for clarifying business record searchwarrants, saying the law should make clear that they arefor national security investigations only, and business owners are allowedto challenge the warrants in court.Greg Nojeim, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, saidthe Justice Department has already conceded those restrictions in courtcases. But he called Gonzales' willingness to consider other modifications""a welcome and constructive change.""""We believe the changes that the attorney general mentioned today wereconceded long ago and much more needs to be doneto bring the Patriot Act in line with the Constitution,""he said.Rick Klein of the Globe staff contributed to this report.
The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, April10:When Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who is not exactly a renownedcivil libertarian, says the Patriot Act may need some adjustments,it clearly has serious problems. The act, which was rushedthrough Congress after the Sept. 11 attacks, gives government toomuch power to invade the privacy of ordinary Americans andotherwise trample on their rights. Congress, which is now reviewingthe act, should rewrite the parts that violate civil liberties.But it is important to realize that most of theworst post-Sept. 11 abuses did not stem from the PatriotAct. If Congress wants to restore the civil liberties Americanshave lost in the last three and a half years,it must also look more broadly at the problems thathave emerged from the war on terror.After Sept. 11, Congress was in such a rush to passthe Patriot Act that, disturbingly, many members did not evenread it before they voted for it. Fortunately, Congress madesome of the most controversial provisions expire by the endof 2005. Last week, it began a series of hearingson the act, focusing on the parts that need tobe reauthorized.The debate over the Patriot Act is too often conducted inbumper stickers, in part because the details are so arcane.Parts of the law are reasonable law enforcement measures thathave generated little controversy. But other parts unquestionably go toofar, and invite the FBI, the CIA and the WhiteHouse to spy on Americans, and suppress political dissent, inunacceptable ways.Libraries and Medical Records Section 215, often called the ""library provision,""is one of the most criticized parts of the act,with good reason. It allows the government to demand library,medical, and other records, and makes it a crime forthe record holders to reveal that the request was made.Section 215 is written far too broadly. It lets thegovernment seize an entire database -- all the medical recordsof a hospital, all of the files of an immigrationgroup -- when it is investigating a single person. Italso is far too invasive; it is hard to believethe FBI needs to monitor library book circulation. If thesearches are allowed, Section 215 should be tightened to givethe government access only to records of a specific personit has legitimate reason to believe is involved in terrorism,not an entire database.The ""gag rule"" that makes it illegal for the record holderto talk publicly about the search also is disturbing, becauseit prevents the public from knowing if the government isabusing these sweeping powers. If the gag rule remains, itshould be limited, so record holders can speak about thesearch after a suitable period of time, or talk aboutit right away without revealing who the target was.Secret Searches Section 213, the ""sneak and peek"" provision, lets thegovernment search a person's home and delay telling him aboutit. These delayed-notification searches fly in the face of thestrong American tradition that the government must announce when itis entering a home. Delayed-notification searches were of questionable legalitybefore the Patriot Act, and Section 213 -- which doesnot expire this year, but is still generating considerable debate-- clearly goes too far. At the very least, itshould apply only to terrorism cases, and not, as itnow does, to all investigations. It should also have clearguidelines for how long notice can be delayed.Secret searches are an area where focusing only on the PatriotAct misses the larger picture of civil liberties violations. Thereis another law, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, that allowsa worse kind of secret search -- one in which,unlike the delayed notification of Section 213, the subject maynever be told about the search at all.One way for Congress to deal with searches under the ForeignIntelligence Surveillance Act -- as well as those under sections213 and 215 of the Patriot Act -- is tomonitor them closely, which is not being done now. Congressionalstaff members with appropriate security clearance should review all requestsfor warrants or subpoenas, and should follow up on theresults of the searches. If the FBI, CIA or otherunits of government are using these tools to spy onAmericans without sufficient justification, Congress needs this information to reinthem in.INFORMATION SHARING: Giving different units of government more power to shareinformation about suspected terrorists is a laudable goal, but thePatriot Act's approach is flawed. It authorizes the FBI, theCIA, and even the White House sweeping access to confidentialinformation gathered about Americans, including telephone and e-mail intercepts. Theaccess is not limited to officials working on terrorism. Andit sweeps in information, like confidential material acquired by grandjuries, that has always been closely guarded. There is areal danger that the new regime established by the actcould produce a massive database on Americans, freely available toall units of government.The Patriot Act makes the same mistake the FBI and CIAhave long made: favoring information quantity over quality. The universeof data that is shared should be narrowed, to focuson information closely related to suspected terrorism, and rather thanbeing indiscriminately dumped, it should be given only to officials,at whatever agency, engaged in investigating terrorism. In the caseof data collected subject to the special powers of acourt, such as wiretaps and secret grand jury material, ajudge's approval should be required before it is simply dumpedinto a general database.BEYOND THE PATRIOT ACT: At last week's hearings, Gonzales conceded thatthe Patriot Act may need some adjustment, while the JusticeDepartment is largely standing by the law, and the FBIis even seeking to expand it. But a coalition ofRepublicans and Democrats in Congress, backed by such unlikely alliesas the American Civil Liberties Union and the American ConservativeUnion, is pushing for changes. In the coming weeks, therewill be more hearings on how the act can beimproved.These hearings should look beyond the Patriot Act, to the largerpicture of civil liberties and the war on terror. AfterSept. 11, the government rounded up illegal immigrants, and puthundreds with no ties to terrorism behind bars for months,often in deplorable conditions. The Justice Department's own inspector generalfound that the government made ""little attempt"" to distinguish peoplewith ties to terrorism from those without. In conducting thisroundup, the Bush administration gave itself far more power thanthe Patriot Act does. Under the act, aliens are tobe held no more than seven days before immigration orcriminal charges are brought.Nor did the Bush administration rely on the Patriot Act forits lawless ""enemy combatant"" doctrine, the basis for holding Americancitizens suspected of terrorism indefinitely, without access to family membersor lawyers. And the administration now claims that the CIAhas the right to secretly transfer suspected terrorists to foreigncountries for interrogation. Critics of the process, known as rendition,say it is being used to subject these suspects totorture. The authority for rendition comes not from the PatriotAct, but from a classified directive that President Bush signedshortly after 9/11.If Congress becomes too bogged down in the minutiae of thePatriot Act in coming weeks, it will be in dangerof missing the larger picture. Revising the law should bethe start, not the end, of its work.
WASHINGTON - The Senate Intelligence Committee will meet behind closed doorsthis week to consider legislation that could dramatically expand thegovernment's police powers under the USA Patriot Act, including alittle-discussed provision to enlarge the FBI's ability to wiretap peoplewho it suspects are national security threats.The proposal, in a draft bill sponsored by committee chairman PatRoberts, Republican of Kansas, would lift one of the lastrestrictions on special warrants the FBI can obtain through asecret court originally set up to monitor foreign spies: thatthe information the bureau wants must be related to internationalterrorism or foreign intelligence.Instead, the FBI could use the warrants, which bypass normal constitutionalsafeguards, to look for evidence of unrelated crimes that itcould use to get suspects off the street. The wiretapprovision is one of three major additions in the draftbill, which would reauthorize the Patriot Act, the package ofenhanced law enforcement powers enacted after the attacks of Sept.11, 2001.If the bill became law, it also would give FBI agentsthe power to write their own subpoenas without permission froma judge, allowing them to seize records from hotels, banks,and Internet service providers. This provision would require the FBIto make periodic reports to Congress about how often ituses that power to obtain library records, bookstore and firearmssales receipts, and medical or tax records.The bureau also would have the authority to order the USPostal Service to make and turn over photocopies of envelopesaddressed to or sent from people who have some connectionto ongoing national security investigations. And the bill would extendthe deadline before the FBI is required to ask ajudge to extend or renew a wiretap.The draft bill Roberts has sponsored would escalate the government agents'police powers at a time when civil libertarians have beentrying to roll back the Patriot Act by urging greateroversight of investigations by courts and Congress. The Intelligence Committeebill doesn't include the new safeguards that critics, including bothDemocrats and Republicans, have proposed.Lisa Graves, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, calledthe proposed bill a strategic maneuver by Republicans to shiftarguments from curbing the Patriot Act to expanding it.""It's an attempt to force the debate onto their terms, versuswhere the momentum has been headed, which is to rollback the Patriot Act to bring it in line withthe Constitution and make sure its tools are focused onterrorists, as opposed to Americans,"" Graves said.The draft of Roberts's proposal is still largely under wraps, andno one at the Justice Department nor the Intelligence Committeewas available to comment on it late last week. Itwas given to a small group of specialists who testifiedat the only public hearing in the Intelligence Committee inlate May. At that little-noticed hearing, the FBI's general counsel,Valerie Caproni, testified that the Justice Department strongly supported Roberts'bill.""Many of the most important provisions of the USA Patriot Act... are scheduled to sunset at the end of thisyear, and the [Justice] Department therefore applauds this committee fortaking up legislation that would make permanent those provisions,"" shesaid, according to her prepared opening statement at the hearing.""We are also heartened that this committee has come forwardwith novel and worthwhile ideas for strengthening the department's counterterrorismcapabilities.""Two of the new powers the Intelligence Committee would give tothe FBI bear a strong resemblance to tools the bureauhas long coveted, but which federal judges in the pasthave rejected.In 2002, the Bush administration argued that, under the original languageof the Patriot Act, it should be able to usethe national security warrants from the secret Foreign Intelligence SurveillanceCourt to look for evidence of ordinary crimes as away to keep suspected terrorists off the streets - thesame idea contained in the Roberts bill. It was rejectedby a special review panel for the secret court.""We see not the slightest indication that Congress meant to givethat power to the Executive Branch,"" wrote the panel, madeup of federal appeals court judges. The national security warrantprocess, they declared, ""cannot be used as a device toinvestigate wholly unrelated crimes.""The possibility that the FBI could get such powers under arenewed Patriot Act has alarmed civil libertarians.""From a constitutional standpoint, that would be devastating because it wouldessentially render the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches andseizure completely meaningless,"" said former US Representative Bob Barr, theGeorgia Republican who became a civil liberties specialist for theAmerican Conservative Union, the nation's oldest conservative lobbying organization, afterleaving Congress in 2003.Although the powers sought by the FBI in the Roberts billare significant, neither Roberts nor the Bush administration has madea strong effort to build a public case for whythe bureau needs them before the bill is finalized.Attempts to get a comment from Roberts's spokesman on the IntelligenceCommittee or from the Justice Department, which supervises the FBI,were unsuccessful. Members of the committee staff and representatives ofthe Justice Department said that the two people who areauthorized to talk about the Patriot Act were both away,and that no one else could comment.The FBI was rejected in a prior attempt to write itsown subpoenas for records from businesses if agents determined thatthe records were ""relevant"" to a national security investigation -considered a very low standard to meet. Last fall, judgesstripped the bureau of that power, declaring it unconstitutional.Laws dating back to 1986 had granted the bureau the powerto write its own subpoenas to get telephone and Internetrecords for national security investigations of foreign agents. Business ownersserved with those FBI demand letters were permanently gagged fromtelling anyone about the incident, including their clients and theirown lawyers.In 2001, the Patriot Act removed a key requirement. Now, thesubject only has to be ""relevant"" to investigations of suspectedterrorists or foreign spies, a significantly broader standard.After FBI agents used the power to demand unspecified customer servicerecords from an Internet service provider, the company challenged thebureau in court instead of complying.In September 2004, a judge ruled that power unconstitutional, saying thatit violated both free speech and unreasonable search protections. Thatcase is still under appeal, but the draft bill wouldrestore the power and expand it to any kind ofrecords, papers, or other ""tangible things"" about a target whichare held by a third party, with new procedures intendedto address the constitutional issues.Civil libertarians argue that the FBI has not clearly shown howits investigations have been hampered for lack of this power.And they warn that - unlike the Internet service providerwho took the bureau to court - few business ownerswill assume the expense of fighting such a subpoena, evenif it is unreasonable, since their own privacy is notat stake.Moreover, the Roberts provisions would surpass what is already one ofthe most controversial parts of the original Patriot Act: asection that allows the FBI to get warrants for customerrecords from the secret court, which was created in 1978by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.This provision has been attacked by a range of critics, includinglibrarians, who fear it will be used to obtain readinglists of their patrons. The Bush administration has said ithas never used this power against libraries.At a time when critics of the Patriot Act want tocurtail this power, the Intelligence Committee proposal would eliminate itsfinal check - lifting the requirement that the FBI getpermission from the secret court before seizing the records.""The administrative subpoena proposal is alarming because [the Patriot Act version]was already way broader than anything they needed,"" argued StephenSchulhofer, a New York University law professor and author ofa new book about the Patriot Act.
PRUNING THE PATRIOT ACTCONGRESS APPROVED the USA Patriot Act in aflush of fear following the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001,but it had the good sense to put a timelimit on many of the most controversial sections so theyexpire next Dec. 31. It ought to assess their effectivenessand potential for abuse rather than toughening the act, asone influential senator proposes.Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee,wants to expand the ability of the FBI to usesearch warrants issued by a secret intelligence court. Under Roberts'splan, the agents could use this authority to look forevidence of crimes unrelated to the purpose of the warrants.Roberts would also allow FBI agents to write their own subpoenaswithout having to get permission from a judge. And theFBI would be able to order the US Postal Serviceto provide copies of envelopes addressed to or sent frompeople linked to national security investigations.Neither Roberts nor the FBI has yet made the case thatthese powers are essential to thwart terrorism. The senator's attemptto attach them to renewal of the Patriot Act hasdiverted attention from more pressing matters, such as whether thissprawling piece of legislation has been effective and whether itinfringes on Americans' liberties.In ""Rethinking the Patriot Act,"" a study to be released thisweek by the Century Foundation in New York, legal scholarStephen J. Schulhofer concludes that while some sections of thelaw are useful, its implications for civil liberties are troublingand its impact on terrorism is unclear.Schulhofer joins many librarians who worry that enhanced search powers fordocuments allows government agents to rummage through Americans' private records,including the books they borrow. No doubt most federal agentswill use common sense when seeking this information, but therisk of abuse is still too high for this sectionto remain in effect.Roberts's committee, which was drafting its version of a Patriot Actextension yesterday, will not have the last word on revisingthe law; the House has yet to prepare its ownproposal. Congress ought to be pruning unnecessary, intrusive sections insteadof adding more threats to personal liberty.Congress passed the Patriot Act in a climate of understandable urgency.Schulhofer concludes that ""legal limitations bear little if any ofthe blame for Sept. 11."" With the advantage of hindsightand with adequate time to deliberate, Congress has an importantchance to get it right this year.
","By April 2005 five states were in revolt against the Patriot Act, urging that restrictions be placed on its broad powers. The ""library provision"" that allowed searching of library records, caused five states and 375 communities in 43 states to pass anti-Patriot Act resolutions, the ACLU said. Nevertheless, the Bush administration continued its campaign to preserve the Patriot Act and even to expand it. Congress considered legislation that could enlarge the FBI's ability to wiretap people whom it suspected were security risks. Also, it would lift a restriction on special warrants, that information obtained must be related to terrorism. ","Congress began consideration of Patriot Act (PA) renewal on April 4, 2005. By then 5 states and 375 county and city governments had passed resolutions warning of the Act's excesses. Senators Craig (R-ID) and Durbin (D-IL) had drafted The Safety and Freedom Enforcement Act (SAFE) eliminating the three main targets of the civil libertarians. The Administration pushed for making the entire PA permanent. Testimony by the Attorney General and FBI Director opened the debate. By June the Administration's case was made in draft legislation offered by Sen. Roberts (R-KS) further strengthening federal powers and countering SAFE. ","Anti-Patriot Act resolutions were adopted in five states and 375 communities. While Congress debated making Patriot Act provisions permanent, there was strong bipartisan support for retaining the ""sunset"" provisions to ensure Justice Department accountability. Critics of the Patriot Act sought changes to limit the Act in several ways, including informing suspects of ""sneak and peek"" searches within 7 days unless a judge intervened. The Senate Intelligence Committee met behind closed doors to consider a draft bill that would escalate government police powers. The bill was viewed as a Republican maneuver to shift arguments to expanding the Patriot Act. ","Delayed Notification Searches (called sneak and peek) are the central issue regarding extending, modifying or curbing executive powers under the Patriot Act. The Justice Department urges extension. The ACLU and some conservative libertarians call for curbing powers. Five state legislatures and several communities have passed resolutions to limit executive powers. A bill by Senators Durbin and Craig would amend the Act. A draft bill by Senator Roberts Intelligence Committee would extend FBI powers. Gonzales said at one point the search authority had been used 35 times. Later, that figure was given as 155 times as of January 2005. "
D0923,D0923-A,"New driver's license rules tucked in a military spending bill will createnational identification cards for Americans and stick state governments with thebill, Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander said.Alexander, a Tennessee Republican, joined Democrats and state officials inrailing against the White House-backed driver's license rules and otherimmigration measures before the Senate approved the $82 billion (euro63.79billion) spending bill 100-0. The House approved it last week.Several states fear the new rules will be costly, provide little protectionagainst invasions of privacy and identity theft, and make getting a driver'slicense a bigger headache for Americans.The rules are aimed at stopping illegal immigrants from getting driver'slicenses to prevent them from boarding planes or entering protected federalbuildings. States will have three years to meet the new standards that includeverifying applicants are American citizens or legal residents.The House had included the rules and other the immigration provisions in itsversion of the bill paying for the U.S. operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. TheSenate did not, but negotiators included them in the final bill.Alexander and other lawmakers said the rules established in the REAL ID Act willhave unintended consequences. Driver's license examiners trained to decidewhether a person can parallel park will have to determine whether an applicantis an al-Qaida terrorist, he said.""It's possible that some governor may look at this and say, 'Wait a minute. Whoare these people in Washington telling us what to do with our driver's licensesand making us pay for them, too?'"" Alexander said.Some states have threatened to challenge the new driver's license orders incourt and even disobey them.Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, vice chairman of the National GovernorsAssociation, has said ""if more than half of the governors agree we're not goingdown without a fight on this, Congress will have to consider changing"" therules. Huckabee also is a Republican.""If you think a trip to the division of motor vehicle is a bad experience today,wait until the REAL ID takes effect,"" Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat,said.All but one of the 19 hijackers in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks had some form ofU.S. identification, some of it fraudulent, the Sept. 11 commission found. Thecommission recommended the federal government set standards for birthcertificates and other identification documents, including driver'slicenses.Congress created a panel to negotiate new driver's license standards, but thenew rules supersede the panel.The new rules were written by Rep. James Sensenbrenner, House JudiciaryCommittee chairman, who failed in attempts to include similar provisions in anintelligence reorganization bill signed by President George W. Bush last year.He was promised he could add them to the first bill guaranteed to getcongressional approval.Sensenbrenner's spokesman Jeff Lungren said the rules do not create a nationalID card but are ""merely settings standards for the states"" and building onstates' ongoing efforts to boost driver's license security.The bill allows the Homeland Security secretary to provide grants to states tohelp defray costs, but it includes no money for them. Lungren said that will beaddressed in appropriations bills.___On the Net:
Immigrant rights groups on Wednesday attacked the Senate's passage of newdriver's license rules aimed at preventing terrorism, saying they won't securethe nation and reflect surging hostility toward the foreign-born in the UnitedStates.""This is clearly an anti-immigrant bill that's going to have a very harmfulimpact on the Latino community and all immigrant communities,"" said MicheleWaslin, director of immigration policy research at the National Council of LaRaza.""It doesn't make us one iota safer. Not a single immigrant is going to bereturned to his or her home country if they're denied a driver'slicense.""The REAL ID Act would require states to verify that people who apply for adriver's license are in the country legally. It would also make it harder forimmigrants to gain amnesty, and easier to override environmental laws to build abarrier along the Mexican border in California.The provision was folded into an emergency military spending bill that earmarks$82 billion (euro63.65 billion) for the war in Iraq. It was approved by theHouse last week and now goes to President George W. Bush, who is expected tosign it.Immigrants' advocates say the measure is the latest example of America'sincreasingly hostile climate toward foreign-born residents, an atmospheredramatically worsened by the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and continuallyfueled by the ongoing war in Iraq.""America is a country of paradoxes: We are a country of immigrants, yet weattack immigrants,"" said Wade Henderson, president of the Leadership Council onCivil Rights, a coalition group in Washington, D.C. that in March sent apetition _ signed by 64 member organizations _ calling on legislators to voteagainst the act.""The REAL ID Act is the most blatant attack on immigrant rights since the lastmajor overhaul of immigration law in 1996,"" he said.Henderson and other advocates said the more than 10 million undocumentedimmigrants already in the country _ with more arriving monthly _ demonstrate thepressing need for comprehensive immigration reform. Such changes are beingdrafted by several senators and are expected to include a proposed guest workerprogram that would allow immigrants already in the United States to worklegally.""Rather than spending our time diddling about with issues of who's going todrive and who's not going to drive in this country, we should address the wholequestion of immigration reform,"" said Cesar Perales, president of the PuertoRican Legal Defense and Education Fund, based in New York.Opponents also complained that the immigration measures were combined with anemergency measure for military spending, forcing a rushed vote with no Senatehearings amid heavy political pressure.""This wasn't vetted, and it was attached to this political must-pass bill,"" saidChristine Gleichert, legislative director for the American-ArabAnti-Discrimination Committee. ""We know senators and members of Congress can'tand won't vote against funding for our troops, but this provision should nothave been attached to it. They sold it as part of national security.""All but one of the 19 hijackers in the Sept. 11 attacks had some form of U.S.identification, some of it fraudulent, the Sept. 11 commission found. Thecommission recommended the federal government set standards for birthcertificates and other identification documents, including driver'slicenses.Congress created a panel to negotiate new driver's license standards, but thenew rules supersede the panel.Advocates say the new measure could actually backfire because many undocumentedimmigrants' personal information will no longer be kept in state databases,making it much harder to track them. They also say that, with fewer licenseddrivers, they expect an increase in drivers who lack auto insurance.Some states have voiced opposition to the REAL ID Act, and there are early signsthat some may refuse to implement it for lack of funding, among other issues.The measure gives them three years to meet the new standards. In addition, statelegislators and courts have already begun to craft their own rules on the issue.In Utah and Tennessee, new laws mandate that undocumented immigrants turn overtheir driver's licenses and get new driving cards, which are not valid asofficial identification and cannot be used to board a plane.On Tuesday, a state judge in New York ruled that the Department of MotorVehicles may not deny licenses to those who cannot prove they are citizens.State officials plan to appeal.""In the short term, there will be lots of confusion,"" Henderson said. ""There wasa broad coalition of groups that opposed the REAL ID Act ... and they'llcontinue to look at implementation. Our view is that provisions of this law willprove largely unattainable.""
Immigration reform is back on the table -- with a vengeance.Last month, House Judiciary Committee Chairman James Sensenbrennersucceeded in attaching his Real ID Act to a must-pass Iraqappropriations bill. Now that spending measure is coming up in theSenate, and though it's unclear how the upper chamber will handle thecongressman's proposal, members are girding for an all-out fight overimmigration.The Sensenbrenner legislation, tagged as a security measure, is ahodgepodge of provisions: one aimed at finishing a few miles of fenceon the border near Tijuana, another raising barriers to asylum seekerswho claim they are fleeing abuse in their home countries.But the section likely to create the most controversy would make itmore difficult for states to issue driver's licenses to illegalimmigrants. Already under attack from both the right and the left, ithas also provoked calls for still tougher measures, including anational ID card.The bill's history in the House, where it passed on a 261-161 vote,holds crucial lessons for to them. And we willnot put an end to the illegal influx until we find a way to preventemployers from hiring unauthorized workers.The unavoidable answer -- albeit deeply unpopular in this country --is a credible ``employer verification'' system: one that replacesexisting fraud-prone employment practices with a better way ofensuring that businesses hire only legal residents. And even somepolicymakers who favor a temporary worker program are beginning tothink this might require some sort of employee ID.Most Americans detest that idea, to put it mildly. We relish ourprivacy, we bristle at government interference in business -- andobviously any effort to prevent hiring one kind of worker will meanmonitoring all hiring. Though the idea of creating national databaseshas grown more acceptable since 9/11, the mere mention of worker IDcards is still enough, in most circles, to end all discussion of anemployment-based strategy.It's hardly surprising that the last time we tried anemployer-based approach -- penalties against businesses that hireillegal workers are part of the landmark Immigration Reform andControl Act (IRCA) that Congress passed in 1986 -- it was so watereddown as to be all but irrelevant. Still, unappealing as it may sound,an employer-verification system is e currently allowed): updated Social Security cards, driver'slicenses, temporary worker's visas and green cards. But any employeeneed produce only one. The cards would have to have photos. Ideally,the Department of Homeland Security would coordinate with the SocialSecurity Administration so that the only other information requiredwould be a Social Security number, which in the future could beembedded in all four types of cards.As with credit card verification, responses would have to come inreal time, and employers would learn only one thing about employees:whether they are authorized to work or not. Existing databases wouldhave to be vastly improved: The 10-year-old pilot program that somebusinesses already use to verify workers' identities still producesfar too many false hits, though the number is declining. As withcredit histories, employees who were denied work would have access totheir records and an easy-to-use appeals process.Equally important, the new system must be phased in over time. Wemight start with temporary workers only, or with one sector -- say,agriculture. Companies -- especially small companies -- that wished tocontinue with the current paper-based method would be permitted to doso. Any expansion of the program would be tied to proof that it wasworking well. And of course it would hardly make sense except in thecontext of immigration reform that provided U.S. industries reliant onforeign laborers with enough legal workers to function and grow.None of this will be easy, and the public is right to be skeptical.But in the long run, if it's done properly, a program of this kindwould benefit everyone. Employers would get the workers they need withmuch less trouble -- the current paper-based system is notoriouslycumbersome -- and more peace of mind.Authorized immigrants would welcome a card they could rely on, andthey would face less discrimination than they are currently exposedto. As for American workers, we would have no less privacy than wehave now. We already provide this information when we get hired for anew job. The only difference under the new system is that it wouldhappen electronically.As it is, most Americans defy the law every day, many of us severaltimes, benefiting one way or another from the work of illegalimmigrants. We all say this is unacceptable; we say we want change.But ending the illegality is going to take more than a few miles ofnew fence. Do we want a working system, economically realistic butalso airtight? Are we prepared to do what it takes to secure ourborders and restore the rule of law?Think about it -- think about both the costs and the benefits -- thenext time you use your credit card.-- Tamar Jacoby is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute andeditor of ``Reinventing the Melting Pot: The New Immigrants and WhatIt Means to Be American'' (Basic Books).
WASHINGTON - Congress is poised to pass a law that wouldmake sweeping changes to the nation's system for issuing driver'slicenses by imposing stringent requirements on states to verify theauthenticity of birth certificates, Social Security cards, legal residency visas,and bank and utility records used to obtain a license.House Republicans attached the bill to a must-pass supplemental spending packagefor troops in Iraq without first putting it through theusual legislative scrutiny of hearings and debate. Should it emergeintact from House-Senate negotiations over the spending package, it couldbe law next month.Touted as an antiterrorism measure, the ""Real ID Act"" would alsooverturn laws in nine states that allow illegal immigrants toobtain driver's licenses. If a state does not comply withany provision of the law, its residents would no longerbe able to use their driver's licenses for federal identificationpurposes, such as for boarding a plane.The law, some say, would effectively turn the new driver's licenseinto a national identification card. Its chief champion, House JudiciaryChairman James Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, says the measure wouldhelp prevent terrorists from fraudulently gaining official documents that wouldallow them to enter the country and move freely.Another set of provisions would significantly raise the standard of proofthat asylum applicants must meet when claiming that they havebeen persecuted on ethnic, religious, or political grounds. It wouldalso grant greater discretion to Homeland Security officials to rejectasylum seekers and curtail the ability of appeals courts toissue stays of deportation orders and review rejected cases.Terrorists have ""used almost every conceivable means of entering the country,""Sensenbrenner said in a statement provided by an aide. ""Theyhave come as students, tourists, and business visitors. They havealso been [legal permanent residents] and naturalized US citizens. Theyhave snuck across the border illegally, arrived as stowaways onships, used false passports, and have been granted amnesty. Terroristshave even used America's humanitarian tradition of welcoming those seekingasylum. We must plug these gaps.""But many critics of the Real ID Act say that itgoes too far and that its language is riddled withproblems that might have been corrected through the normal legislativereview process.""This bill has not received a single hearing in either chamberof Congress, so the challenges it presents for states havenever received any attention,"" said Cheye Calvo of the NationalConference of State Legislatures. ""It does much more than justdeny driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.""State legislators and governors say that the Real ID Act wouldlead to horrific delays at motor vehicle bureaus, that itwould cost hundreds of millions of dollars more than Congressthinks, and that it would impose an unrealistic three-year deadlinefor having the verification system in place.Moreover, civil libertarians argue that by creating uniform national standards fordriver's licenses and requiring states to pool driver information ina national database, the bill is a back-door move tocreating a national identification card, which they oppose on privacygrounds.And immigrant advocates fear the asylum changes are too draconian andwill hurt people with legitimate claims of persecution.But Sensenbrenner is pushing hard to keep the measure on thefinal Iraq spending bill, and his opinion carries special weightin Congress. Republican leaders promised him last December that theReal ID Act would get a quick hearing in 2005after he agreed to remove it from a major intelligenceoverhaul bill that the Bush administration needed to pass.Moreover, political observers say the Bush administration is unwilling to antagonizeSensenbrenner because, as Judiciary Committee chairman, he will hold swayover President Bush's proposal to reform the immigration system byestablishing a system of guest worker visas.""They're going to stick it on the supplemental, and it's goingto stay on there,"" Senate minority leader Harry Reid, Democratof Nevada, said Monday. ""It's a terrible piece of legislation.... They put it on a supplemental, which they knewyou couldn't stop. I've had a senator come to meand say, 'We're going to filibuster this.' I said, 'Getreal. It's not going to happen. It's a defense bill.""'Six Republican senators last week expressed similar concerns when they signeda letter asking Senate majority leader Bill Frist, Republican ofTennessee, not to let the Real ID Act appear inthe final bill. They were led by Senator Sam Brownbackof Kansas, a lawmaker close to evangelical Christian groups whoare particularly concerned about the asylum provisions.""Legislating in such a complex area without the benefit of hearingsand expert testimony is a dubious exercise and one thatsubverts the Senate's deliberative process,"" said the letter, which wasalso signed by Republicans John McCain of Arizona, Lamar Alexanderof Tennessee, John Sununu of New Hampshire, Chuck Hagel ofNebraska, and Richard Lugar of Indiana.Jeff Lungren, a Sensenbrenner spokesman, Monday rejected the notion that thebill could use further debate, arguing that the policy proposalscontained in the Real ID Act have been public sinceSensenbrenner tried unsuccessfully to include them in the 2004 intelligenceoverhaul law.""Since that [intelligence] bill passed about five months or so ago,this issue has continued to be at the forefront,"" Lungrensaid. ""Just because some senators have chosen not to addressit and to ignore it doesn't mean that we don'tneed to have these provisions and bolster our border securitynow.""Cory Smith, who has been tracking the asylum provisions for HumanRights First, called Lungren's comments ""disingenuous.""""I'm sure at some place somewhere years ago something about asylumwas brought up, but there were no hearings on this,""he said. ""There has not been careful consideration of theseserious changes to asylum law and immigration policy.""Calvo and Lungren also sparred over how much the driver's licensingprovisions would cost.Lungren pointed to a $100 million estimate by the Congressional BudgetOffice. But Calvo said the real amount is more likelyto be between $500 million and $700 million when thecost of such items as new equipment to tap intonational databases is included.Tim Sparapani, ACLU legislative counsel, said the Real ID Act's ruleswould result in a de facto national identification card becauseit would require states to pool driver data in anational database.""When you condition travel on an identification card and create aninternal registry of citizens and a way to track them,that is entirely contrary to most Americans' understandings of theway their country works and should work,"" Sparapani said.
A MISTAKEN ID BILL CONGRESS IS in danger of passing legislationthat could damage immigration policy under the false pretense ofenhancing national security. The Senate should block this ill-conceived proposaland take a more measured look at immigration reform.House Republican James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin says his bill, the RealID Act, will keep terrorists from crossing US borders. Ina January column he writes: ""The goal of the RealID Act is straightforward: it seeks to prevent another 9/11-typeattack by disrupting terrorist travel.""But the rhetoric promises more protection than the bill delivers.A key feature of the bill is the denial of driver'slicenses to illegal immigrants. But most of the illegal immigrantswho get licenses in the nine states that grant themare trying to earn a living, not commit terrorist acts.The real challenge is figuring out how to manage undocumenteddrivers. Mass deportation is unlikely because many of these driversare essential to America's economy. They are vital in variousindustries, including the business of getting food into grocery stores.Sensenbrenner's bill would compel states to add security features to alldriver's licenses and create a license database that other statescould access. This would essentially create a national ID card,an idea that should be thoroughly debated on its own,not slipped through a back door.If it passes, the Real ID Act could cause delays inmotor vehicle registry offices as states scramble to meet thenew requirements. Residents of states that fail to comply couldfind that their licenses are useless as IDs at airports,grounding people unless they have passports to use as identification.The Real ID Act would also demand more proof from asylumseekers. Government officials could ask for ""corroborating evidence."" This isoverkill. Many victims of torture and abuse are unlikely tobe able to provide such evidence, especially if they comefrom countries where law enforcement officials are blind to, orcomplicit in, abuses.Sensenbrenner calls for more barriers and surveillance technology along the southernUS border. Illegal immigration should be discouraged. But this billignores the real need for laws that let immigrant workerstravel safely and legally between the United States and Mexico.Sensenbrenner introduced the Real ID Act in January. Last month theHouse attached the act to an emergency spending bill forIraq and other needs, forcing the Senate to consider it.House and Senate conferees are meeting now to reconcile their versionsof the spending bill. They should leave the Real IDAct on the cutting room floor. It offers false securityinstead of intelligent reform.
It's crunch time on a major piece of immigrationlegislation and all sides are stepping up the pressure.The Real ID Act, which restricts illegal immigrants from getting driver'slicenses and tightens asylum laws, is expected to be approvedor rejected by House and Senate negotiators Thursday.Proponents of the measure -- including a group of immigration controlactivists in town for a week of lobbying -- saidthey were cautiously optimistic, especially after the White House endorsedit in a letter to House and Senate conferees earlierthis week.""We feel pretty good about it,"" said Carlos Espinosa, spokesman forRep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., a leading critic of illegal immigration.Jeff Lungren, a spokesman for the House Judiciary Committee, said thatnegotiations on the Real ID Act ""are going well"" andinvolved the leadership in both chambers.But Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said that Democrats havebeen ""completely shut out of the backroom negotiations"" in ""yetanother example of the Republican leadership's abuse of power.""""This legislation would make sweeping, controversial changes to our laws withrespect to the environment, refugees, judicial review, the states' powerto make decisions about their own laws, and other issues,""Reid said. ""This legislation has never been considered by theSenate. It has not been subjected to any hearings, debate,amendments, or any votes at all by this body.""Other opponents of the immigration measure -- including immigrant advocates, religiousgroups, human rights organizations, the National Conference of State Legislators,and the American Civil Liberties Union -- were trying hardto stop it.Several of the groups were planning a telephone conference call onThursday to urge lawmakers to drop the legislation from alarger emergency spending bill.""This country has been known to have safe haven for people,and we're fearful that, with this measure, that won't happen,""said Judith Golub, senior director of advocacy and public affairsof the American Immigration Lawyers Association.House and Senate negotiators are working to reconcile two versions ofthe emergency spending bill, one of which includes the immigrationprovisions. The bill is urgently needed to fund military operationsand rebuilding efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well astsunami relief efforts in Asia.The Real ID Act was added to the spending bill inthe House in an effort spearheaded by Rep. James Sensenbrenner,R-Wis., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. The Senate versiondid not include the immigration provisions.The bill would require people applying for or renewing driver's licensesto confirm their legal status in the United States. Theresidents of states that don't comply won't be allowed touse the driver's licenses as identification to board planes orapply for Social Security and other benefits.Proponents say the measure would stop foreign terrorists from obtaining driver'slicenses which they could use to travel in the UnitedStates and would also stop terrorists from taking advantage ofU.S. asylum laws.Opponents say that the Real ID Act is an anti-immigrant measurethat would not improve security and hasn't been vetted throughthe congressional process.Critics say the measure would result in more dangerous roadways, withthousands of illegal immigrants driving without licenses or insurance.In addition, the American Civil Liberties Union says that a provisionin the bill to link state driver's license databases wouldcreate a de facto national ID card and a ""showus your papers"" society.The driver's licence issue has energized groups upset about illegal immigration.Some are in Washington this week for a six-day lobbyingeffort on various immigration topics. It includes a gathering of18 radio talk-show hosts from around the country.At a press conference Tuesday hosted by the Federation for AmericanImmigration Reform, a group that advocates reducing immigration, Rep. DanaRohrabacher, R-Calif., said that illegal immigration is ""threatening to ourvery survival as a nation"" because it brings down wagesand ""destroys our health care and education system.""""They don't deserve a drivers license, they deserve to be drivento the border,"" and thrown over, said Rohrabacher, a nine-termlawmaker who chairs a science subcommittee.The comment drew raucous applause and cheers from the crowd ofabout 150 people.
A bill that would enact hotly contested immigration rules,including one that would bar illegal immigrants from getting driver'slicenses, is marching toward approval with the backing of theWhite House.The provisions are attached to an emergency spending bill that wouldprovide $81 billion for military efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.A bipartisan House-Senate conference committee is expected to agree on acompromise version of the bill today; each chamber is slatedto vote on the measure within the next two weeksand then send it to President Bush for his signature.The immigration provisions, which were introduced as the Real ID Actin January, include new identification requirements for people seeking driver'slicenses, toughened standards for immigrants seeking asylum in the UnitedStates, and money to complete a three-mile stretch of borderfencing near San Diego.The House version contains the immigration provisions but the Senate's versiondoes not.Lawmakers from both parties, as well as civil liberties groups andimmigration advocates, decry the addition of the provisions to themust-pass supplemental bill. Supporters of the provisions know that itwould be politically unwise for anyone to vote against abill that sends money to American soldiers.Furthermore, high-level lobbying by the Real ID measures' author, Judiciary CommitteeChairman Rep. James Sensenbrenner, House Majority Leader Tom DeLay andthe White House helped silence discussion of handling the provisionsas separate legislation.In a letter to Congress dated Monday, Joshua Bolten, director ofthe Office of Management and Budget, strongly encouraged Congress toinclude the immigration provisions and said the legislation would ""strengthenthe ability of the United States to protect against terroristentry into and activities within the United States.""Some experts say the president's support for the tough immigration provisionssends mixed messages. He also is pushing a temporary guestworker program to make it easier for illegal immigrants towork in the United States and is working hard toimprove U.S.-Mexico relations.""We think that the long-term future of North America is moreties between communities, but when we see fences going up,it seems to send the wrong message,"" said Nestor Rodriguez,co-director of the Center for Immigration Research at the Universityof Houston.Some lawmakers, including Houston Republican Rep. John Culberson, a staunch advocateof stronger immigration controls, are completely dedicated to making surethe provisions remain in the bill.""Stopping the flood of illegal immigrants and protecting our borders ismy single highest legislative priority,"" Culberson said. ""We need actionnow, and the only sure way to enact immigration changeis to attach it to an emergency spending bill.""Indeed, Culberson said he and his allies in the House wouldvote against the military spending bill if the immigration provisionsare removed.""We would bring it down if we need to,"" he said.""I would in two heartbeats. I am fed up withthe complete lack of enforcement of our immigration laws.""The bill would set national standards compelling states to issue driver'slicenses only to those lawfully in the country. Nine statescurrently allow illegal immigrants to get licenses.Residents of states that don't comply with the law would notbe allowed to use their driver's licenses as federal identification,needed to board commercial aircraft, for example.The license changes have raised several concerns. Civil liberties groups worrythe move takes the country closer to a national IDcard. Some states feel the changes present a bureaucratic burdenand some experts say illegal immigrants will continue to drive,but without insurance.The provisions also would raise the standard of proof that asylumapplicants must meet if they claim that they have beenpersecuted on ethnic, religious or political grounds in their homecountries.The asylum rules are unnecessary, said Joseph Vail, a former immigrationjudge and director of the Immigration Clinic at the Universityof Houston Law Center.""The standards are already extremely high,"" he said. ""There is notone example of a terrorist having been granted asylum. Theend result will be that qualified asylum-seekers will be deniedasylum.""The bill would pay for supplies, services, training and facility improvementsfor U.S. troops overseas and also fund various programs, suchas those that buy back weapons from foreign insurgents andcounter-drug efforts in Afghanistan.
Same day driver's licenses could become a thing ofthe past under legislation near final approval in Congress, theNational Conference of State Legislators said Tuesday.The measure, which restricts illegal immigrants from getting driver's licenses andtightens U.S. asylum laws, was approved by House and Senatenegotiators Tuesday. It is part of an $82 billion emergencyspending bill to fund military operations and rebuilding efforts inIraq and Afghanistan, as well as tsunami relief efforts inAsia.It is expected to pass the House within days and theSenate next week.Cheye Calvo, director of the Transportation Committee of the National Conferenceof State Legislators said the driver's license measure would causechaos and backlogs in thousands of department of motor vehicleoffices across the country, making the nation less secure.""I don't think Congress really knows what they are mandating,"" hesaid. ""This bill imposes significant new burdens that will affectall Americans, anyone who has to go to the DMVis affected by this bill.""Some state DMV offices showed a lower level of concern aboutthe legislation, saying that they already comply with many ofthe provisions, but that implementaion of the entire proposal couldbe time consuming and costly.Proponents of the measure, dubbed the REAL ID Act, dismissed Calvo'spredictions as exaggerations from a special interest group and saythat the bill would stop foreign terrorists from obtaining driver'slicenses that they could use to travel in the UnitedStates.Jeff Lungren, a spokesman for the House Judiciary Committee, which spearheadedthe REAL ID Act, said that the states that willbe most affected are the ones doing poorly in verifyingidentification documents, including nine ""problem"" states--Wisconsin, Oregon, Maryland, Michigan, NewMexico, North Carolina, Washington, Hawaii and Montana.If the states refuse to comply with the new law, they""will become even more of a haven for terrorists andillegal aliens to get their driver's licenses,"" he said.The bill would require people applying for or renewing driver's licensesto confirm their legal status in the United States. Theresidents of states that don't comply won't be allowed touse the driver's licenses as identification to board planes orapply for Social Security and other federal benefits.Calvo said that language currently in the bill would require statesto verify the authenticity of each identification document -- includingbirth certificates and utility bills, with the original sources.This would require states, within three years, to upgrade 3,000 departmentsof motor vehicle offices, train workers, and add employees tohandle all the extra phone calls to utility companies, immigrationoffices, and 30,000 vital records offices, some of which aresmall and don't have any full time employees, he said.The National Conference of State Legislators has estimated that this effortwould cost $500 million.""State budgets, in many cases, are already in dire straits. Andwithout federal funding to accompany the federal requirements, some ofthe provisions will be difficult, if not impossible, for statemotor vehicle administrators to implement,"" said Jason King, public affairsdirector with the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators.Lundgren said that the estimates are not based on fact andthat the Congressional Budget Office estimated the effort would cost$100 million in five years.(Begin optional ad)Susan Sports, public information officer with the Georgia Department of MotorVehicle Safety, said that the state already verifies legal U.S.residency and Georgia residency and that employees are trained tospot fake documents.""We have a very secure Georgia driver's license to begin with,""she said.Georgia does not, however, verify each birth certificate with the originalsource, instead relying on the certification on each document, shesaid. Such a process could take time and states wouldhope for federal funding to help, Sports said.It took about a year to implement a real time verificationsystem for Social Security numbers, she added.Tom Vinger, spokesman with the Texas Department of Public Safety, saidthat the department was monitoring the REAL ID legislation ""withgreat interest,"" but he didn't want to comment until afinal bill was passed.""We're not really sure what's going to come out and howit's going to affect us,"" he said. ""If it passes,obviously, it's going to change they way we do business,exactly how is yet to be determined.""Frank Panela, spokesman for the Florida Department of Highway Safety &Motor Vehicles, said that Florida has no problem with theREAL ID Act, because the state already implements most ofthe new rules.""We are already way ahead of the game,"" he said.Florida has a document identification system for Social Security cards, passports,immigration documents and other documents that have certain security features.Fred Stratmann, spokesman for the Ohio Department of Motor Vehicles, saidthat the state would have ""minor implementation issues"" to complywith the new measure, including upgrading computers to store digitalcopies of identification documents.""Ohio is in very good shape in implementing what the lawrequires,"" he said.(End optional ad)Opponents of the legislation also say that it could push moreAmericans to obtain passports for identification, if states can't complywith the difficult mandates. First time passports for adults couldcost as much as $97, including security fees.The Real ID Act was added to the spending bill inthe House in an effort spearheaded by Rep. James Sensenbrenner,R-Wis., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.

(BEGIN ITAL)Recommendation: Secure identification should begin in the United States. Thefederal government should set standards for the issuance of birthcertificates and sources of identification, such as drivers licenses.(END ITAL)The 9/11 Commission Report, quoted above, is clear. Creating a nationwidesecure system of identification is an important national security issue.This is not the first time Congress has been told thata secure national identification system was needed to cure oneproblem or another.Congress may pass a bill or two this year that nodsin the direction of a national identification system. Unfortunately, itlikely will take another commission report before lawmakers get behinda nationwide identity program.In 1995, the bipartisan Commission on Immigration Reform, chaired by formerCongresswoman Barbara Jordan, concluded that immigration laws and employer sanctionscould never be enforced without some form of secure nationalID cards and with an accompanying database of citizens andothers who are in the country legally.Congress long has ignored notices that the United States needs astandardized method to be able to identify and track peoplewho commit crimes in one state and easily take upresidence and new identities in another state.Not only do criminals often avoid justice because of a lackof standardized identification, citizens also avoid court orders for childsupport, custody laws and many other situations simply by skippingout to another state.Meanwhile, voter fraud could be reduced with secure national IDs.In recent years, identity theft has become a burgeoning criminal industrythanks to the lack of a nationwide secure system ofidentification. Such a system could help curb identity theft.Another documented national growth industry involves easily obtained fake identification papers.These inexpensive identity papers can include bogus Social Security cards,birth certificates, check-cashing cards and driver's licenses -- all availablein most cities on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border.The 9/11 Commission Report called for a secure, standardized national identificationsystem as a way to reduce the threat of terrorismand improve homeland security. That's a valid consideration, of course,since national security must always be at the top ofthe list of national priorities.Terrorism and homeland security issues aside, however, the principle of therule of law erodes in the United States when thegovernment fails to enforce the law that prohibits U.S. employersfrom hiring workers who are illegally inside the United States.This was the conclusion of the Jordan commission report on immigrationreform.Without a standardized, secure national system capable of telling citizen fromnoncitizen, U.S. employers routinely are let off the hook whenjob applicants show them any number of easily obtained fakeidentity papers or valid identity cards that offer no proofof citizenship.The Real ID Act (H.R. 418), which Congress likely will passthis year, requires states to verify the legal residency ofdriver's license applicants under threat of having the state's licensesbanned for such federal uses such as boarding airplanes orcashing checks. The act includes standardization, which is good.Problems with this approach include yet another unfunded federal mandate, notto mention a shift in immigration responsibility to state agenciesthat aren't trained or equipped for the duty.Another proposal that could pass Congress this year calls for theSocial Security Administration to replace all current paper Social Securitycards with plastic cards that include a digitized photo withan ""encrypted machine-readable electronic identification strip.""Congress recognizes the problem. That's a start. It should bite thebullet and pass a federal national ID system.Rowland Nethaway is senior editor of the Waco (Texas) Tribune-Herald. E-mail:RNethaway@wacotrib.com
Applicants for state-issued driver's licenses in the United States will be required to producefour types of identification when the Congress approves a plan to discourage illegal immigration, the USA Today newspaper reported Thursday.Most who apply for new licenses -- and presumably, those seeking renewals -- would have to prove that they are in the United States legally, possess document of their social security number and home address and show a photo ID.Motor vehicle department employees then would have to verify the documents with federal databases, a potentially lengthy process that could mean an end to same-day license renewals.Each year, about 70 million people in the United States apply for new driver's licenses or renewals.In most of the states now, the new drivers are typically required to produce proof of age and one or two other forms of ID,usually including a photo. Less is required for those renewing licenses, and a few states, including Maryland, allow renewals by mail.The House is likely to pass the Real ID Act as early as Thursday and the Senate next week, as an attachment to an 81-billion-dollar emergency spending bill to the military in Iraq andAfghanistan.If states did not comply within three years, their driver's licenses could not be used as ID to board a plane or to enter certain federal buildings.Along with extra security at airports and workplaces, the act could represent the most significant differences in daily lives tostem from post Sept. 11 security concerns, according to the report.
","The so-called Real ID Act was attached to a must-pass Iraq appropriations bill. Consequently, legislators had little time to debate the bill before passing it. Only driver's licenses from complying states will be valid for air travel and other official identification purposes. The law would deny licenses to illegal immigrants and would significantly raise the standard of proof of persecution for asylum-seekers. Proponents expect greater homeland security. Opponents say the law is anti-immigrant and would add cost and delays to DMV processes. Civil libertarians argue it creates a de facto national ID card and threatens individual privacy. ","The Real ID Act was attached to a 2005 must-pass Iraq Appropriations bill, bypassing hearings and debate. The Act contains provisions aimed at keeping terrorists from crossing US borders. The most controversial would make it hard for states to issue driver's licenses to illegal immigrants and possibly require a national ID card. States would need to add security features to driver's licenses and create license databases. Most Americans detested the idea. The ACLU tried to stop the bill. Opponents viewed it as a blatant attack on immigrants' rights and did not believe it would improve US security. ",House Judiciary Committee Sensenbrenner attached his Real ID Act to a must-pass Iraq appropriations bill. The bill would make it more difficult for states to issue driver's licenses to illegal immigrants and that it would protect against terrorist entry into the US. Civil libertarians oppose the bill on grounds that it would create a de facto national ID card. The measure may run counter to the president's support for a temporary guest worker program. States fear the act would add another unfunded federal mandate on them and create delays at motor vehicle bureaus. Immigrant rights groups oppose the Act. ,"The Real ID Act was attached to a 2005 Iraq appropriations bill without legislative review. It is intended to stop illegal aliens from having driver's licenses to use to board airplanes and enter public buildings, raise the standard of proof of persecution for asylum seekers, and build a fence on the border near Tijuana, Mexico. Opponents fear the act will create a national ID card; impinge on states' powers; give untrained workers responsibility for immigration control; gridlock the license process; increase unlicensed, uninsured drivers; deny qualified asylum seekers; harm the environment; and cost five times what is expected. "
D0923,D0923-B,"An anti-terrorism law creating a national standard for all driver's licenses by2008 isn't just upsetting civil libertarians and immigration rightsactivists.State motor vehicle officials nationwide who will have to carry out the Real IDAct say its authors grossly underestimated its logistical, technological andfinancial demands.In a comprehensive survey obtained by The Associated Press and in follow-upinterviews, officials cast doubt on the states' ability to comply with the lawon time and fretted that it will be a budget buster.""It is just flat out impossible and unrealistic to meet the prescriptiveprovisions of this law by 2008,"" Betty Serian, a deputy secretary of thePennsylvania Department of Transportation, said in an interview.Nebraska's motor vehicles director, responding to the survey by the AmericanAssociation of Motor Vehicle Administrators, said that to comply with Real IDher state ""may have to consider extreme measures and possibly a completereorganization.""And a new record-sharing provision of Real ID was described by an Illinoisofficial as ""a nightmare for all states.""States use a hodgepodge of systems and standards in granting driver's licensesand identification cards. In some places, a high school yearbook may be enoughto prove identity.A major goal of Real ID _ which was motivated by the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks,whose perpetrators had legitimate driver's licenses _ is to unify the disparatelicensing rules and make it harder to fraudulently obtain a card.The law also demands that states link their record-keeping systems to nationaldatabases so duplicate applications can be detected, illegal immigrants caughtand driving histories shared.State licenses that fail to meet Real ID's standards will not be able to be usedto board an airplane or enter a federal building.The law, which was attached to a funding measure for the Iraq war last May, hasbeen criticized by civil libertarians who contend it will create a de factonational ID card and new centralized databases, inhibiting privacy.State organizations such as the National Governors Association have blasted thelaw as well. Many states will have to amend laws in order tocomply.The August survey by the motor vehicle administrators' group, which has not beenmade public, asked licensing officials nationwide for detailed reports on whatit will take to meet Real ID's demands.""If you begin to look at the full ramifications of this, we are talking aboutbillions and billions of dollars. Congress simply passed an unfunded mandate,""said Barry Steinhardt, director of the technology and liberty project at theAmerican Civil Liberties Union. ""Every motorist in America is going to pay theprice of this, of the Congress' failure to do a serious exploration of the cost,the complexity, of the difficulty.""The survey described a multitude of hurdles.Some examples:_ The law demands that states mine multiple databases to check the accuracy ofdocuments submitted by license applicants. Several states questioned how thatwill work, especially with confirming birth certificates._ Some states' ancient computing systems will have to be overhauled in order tolink to other networks. Minnesota runs a 1980s-era mainframesystem._ Many states don't make drivers prove they are legally in the country, but thelaw will now demand such documentation. It also calls for states to run licenseapplications through a federal database known as SAVE that was launched by a1986 law aimed at preventing illegal immigrants from receiving federal benefits.One problem, though, is that the ""SAVE database is notoriously unreliable ...months behind,"" said South Carolina's response to the survey._ Real ID requires that a license show someone's principal residence. But stateofficials object that a mailing address makes more sense for many people _ for""snowbirds"" who spend time in two states, for example or for public officialswho want to protect their privacy._ The law calls for a person's ""full legal name,"" no nickname or abbreviations,on licenses. Cards have to be redesigned and databases must be reprogrammed tomake room for extremely long names, likely up to 125 characters. That's not aneasy process._ Real ID demands that all driver's licenses or ID cards have pictures that canbe read by facial-recognition technology. That would end many states' practiceof letting people with certain religious beliefs request not to have apicture.""If you take any one of these things individually, you see a significantproblem,"" Steinhardt said. ""There are literally hundreds of these problemsembedded in Real ID, and the statute doesn't give you a way out. It's black andwhite. No exceptions, no reality check.""In many respects it's a statute that ignores reality.""___On the Net:Summary of the law by National Conference of State Legislatures:Virginia's December report:(requires Adobe Reader)
This editorial appeared in Wednesday's Los Angeles Times:In the absence of a national citizen's ID card, which we're notagainst, we're all for Washington establishing some uniform standardsfor state-issued driver's licenses. It's too bad, however, that somein the Congress -- led by House Judiciary Committee Chairman F. JamesSensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis. -- have hijacked this post-Sept. 11imperative with their tiresome anti-immigrant crusade.Last month, the House passed Sensenbrenner's Real ID Act, whichwould prohibit federal agencies from accepting for any officialpurpose state-issued identification cards or driver's licenses thatcould have been issued without verifying the recipient's immigrationstatus. Never mind that 11 states, mindful that the main purpose of alicense is to certify that someone is capable of driving a vehicle,already offer licenses to illegal immigrants. Also included in thebill are several unnecessary provisions that would make it moredifficult for deserving people to seek asylum in the United States.The measure is now before the Senate, attached to the supplementalfunding bill for the war in Iraq. The Senate would be wise to stripthese ``Real ID'' provisions from the legislation.Sensenbrenner claims that this is all about fighting terrorism, buthe cannot be serious in thinking that the security of the UnitedStates would be guaranteed by requiring al-Qaida operatives to provetheir legal status before obtaining an American driver's license.What this congressional measure does guarantee is less safety onthe nation's roads, the result of fewer licensed and insured drivers.Not giving licenses to undocumented workers to drive to work wouldonly make sense in Sensenbrenner's parallel universe, where the UnitedStates doesn't rely heavily on imported labor. Allowing a driver thepossibility to apply for a license to drive to work means thatperson's photograph, address and proof of insurance will be on file atthe local DMV. And that is something to make us all feel safer.The asylum provisions contemplated in Sensenbrenner's bill wouldunnecessarily raise the bar for granting asylum to people fleeingpersecution.Although it is true that more than a decade ago the nation's asylumlaws were abused, the regulations enacted in 1994 by the Clintonadministration clearly restrained any further abuse. The numbers tellthe story: Before 1994, the average number of applicants hoveredaround 143,000 annually; in 2003, there were about 46,000.Sensenbrenner has indicated that he won't consider any immigrationlegislation if Real ID is not enacted into law. Neither the Senate northe president can afford to allow him to establish the terms of thisdebate.
After a late-night debate on the politicallysensitive issue of immigration, the California Assembly on Wednesdaypassed a bill to extend driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.The measure would clear the way for California to create a distinctdriver's license, with a unique design and color, for people whocannot prove legal citizenship in the United States. The license couldbe used only for driving and would not be valid identification forother purposes such as opening a bank account or boarding an airplane.The bill, SB 60 by Democratic Sen. Gil Cedillo, would also allowroughly 800,000 people in California who have applied to federalimmigration officials for legal residency to get a California driver'slicense starting as soon as March 2006.The bill passed 42-34.Cedillo's bill passed the Senate in June on a 22-16 partisan split.Now the Senate is expected to approve recent amendments and send it tothe governor, who is under pressure from Republicans to veto themeasure.Cedillo said he included several elements in the bill aimed atovercoming objections from Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who last yearvetoed a Cedillo driver's license bill. But before the state Assemblytook up the new bill Wednesday, there were no indications that thechanges would satisfy the governor.The governor's office has consistently said Schwarzenegger does notwant to take any action until the federal government finishes decidingits requirements for state licenses -- changes spawned by concern thatterrorists or other criminals could get such documents. Congress gavestates the option to create distinct driver's licenses for illegalimmigrants under the Real ID Act passed in May. That sweeping law willrequire most states to change the information they include on driver'slicenses, the documents they require to issue a license and how theystore driver's license data.Before adopting their own new laws, most states are waiting to seewhat regulations the federal Department of Homeland Security issues toimplement the Real ID Act. Those regulations are expected next year.On the Assembly floor, Democrats argued that the bill would improvehighway safety in California by ensuring that most drivers arelicensed, trained and insured.``This is a good bill because I believe it's the right thing to dobecause individuals are here and they're driving and that's thereality,'' said Democratic Assemblyman Jerome Horton.Republicans argued that the bill would reward people for breakingthe law. Assemblyman Doug La Malfa asked how he could teach hischildren to follow rules ``when the California state Legislature ismaking rules that cause people to not have to obey the law.''But the 90-minute debate focused less on the details of the billthan on the politically sensitive issue of immigration.``Illegal immigration is an enormous cost to this state,'' saidRepublican Assemblyman Mark Wyland. ``And what this does is propose tolegitimize that.''Democratic Assemblyman Alberto Torrico argued that undocumentedworkers, through taxes taken from their wages, ``put in more thanthey're taking out.''``The reward is not the driver's license,'' he said. ``People cometo this country because of the jobs and the economic opportunity andto get what every one of us wants for our children ... a betterlife.''
In a rebuff to California officials andenvironmentalists, the Bush administration cleared the way Wednesdayfor completion of a 14-mile-long border fence that will run throughcoastal wetlands to the Pacific Ocean near San Diego.Exercising the first waiver of environmental laws since Congress inMay gave him the authority to do so, Homeland Security SecretaryMichael Chertoff said that completing the last 3 1/2 miles of thefence -- at a cost of about $32 million -- would allow the U.S. BorderPatrol to create a security corridor between it and the existingborder fence. The zone would include two new fences and two new roadsfor use by border agents, plus stadium-style lighting and surveillancecameras.In the process, said Border Patrol Chief David Aguilar, the agencywould be able to shrink the area agents need to physically patrol from2,000 acres to 200 acres.``Bottom line, this is about border security,'' Aguilar toldreporters. ``We're addressing the vulnerabilities here'' in closing aborder to potential terrorists.Compressing the amount of territory the government patrols, hesaid, also will deter illegal immigration by creating ``certainty ofarrest in that zone.''The Border Patrol chief pledged that his agents would be ``goodstewards of the environment,'' and he blamed much of the area'sdegradation on traffic from border-crossers who take cover in thewetlands and litter the area with trash.With Chertoff's announcement, the department formally waivedenforcement of environmental and other laws that had delayed theproject -- or threatened to.In a statement issued by his office, Chertoff promised to ``act inan environmentally responsible manner consistent with the securityneeds of our nation.''But environmentalists who fought the project say the government isplanning to use soil from a nearby mesa to fill in a canyon, nicknamedSmugglers Gulch, with enough dirt to fill two Hoover Dams. Theybelieve it will trigger severe ecological hardships.``This will cause a tremendous amount of damage to the Tijuanaestuary, particularly downstream,'' said Jim Peugh, chairman of theconservation committee for the San Diego Audubon Society. ``The waivermeans they don't have to respect water quality or endangered speciesor labor or child safety laws. It's a very chilling precedent.''Federal officials have come to San Diego and ``talked, but theydon't listen,'' Peugh said. He argued that the border could beprotected ``without cutting off the tops of the mesas to fill in thecanyon. The problem is they insist on a straight freeway across thecanyons. They have chosen to do it in an environmentally damagingway.''Litigation has dogged the project since Congress approved theborder fence in 1996. Last year, the California Coastal Commission --which regulates coastline development -- refused to grant permits tocomplete the fence, saying the harm to sensitive habitats outweighedsecurity benefits.Peter Douglas, the commission's executive director, saidWednesday's federal action trumped state law.``This is a clear victory for the politics of fear,'' he said.``They were intent on circumventing all the environmental protectionswe spent decades putting into place. They were able to get through theback door what they couldn't get through the front. And there'snothing we can do about it except mourn the day.''California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has called for a balancedapproach in completing a border infrastructure system that weighs bothenvironmental and security considerations.``The federal government appears to have gone to great lengths toallay and avoid environmental concerns, including public hearings andnumerous studies, and Californians appreciate that,'' Schwarzenegger'soffice said in a statement Wednesday.Outraged by what they saw as obstructionism by environmentalists,congressional Republicans passed the Real ID Act in May, giving theHomeland Security secretary authority to waive any legal requirementsthat he, in his discretion, ``determines necessary to ensureexpeditious construction'' of barriers, like border fences, under hisjurisdiction.Hailing Chertoff's move Wednesday, Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif.,castigated ``the dilatory efforts which have restricted this nationalsecurity element for so many years.'' Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr.,R-Wis., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, likewise decriedthose who ``stymied (the project) by litigation and obstructionism.''
The majority of Californians support a guest-workerprogram for illegal immigrants and do not believe that they are takingjobs from the state's residents, according to a statewide pollreleased Thursday.In addition, those surveyed hold a more positive view of illegalimmigrants than in previous years, the nonpartisan Field Pollreported. Last month, 47 percent of those surveyed said they believethat undocumented immigrants are having a ``favorable impact'' on thestate, compared to 19 percent in 1982.Voters and nonvoters, however, hold dramatically different views onthe subject. About 36 percent of voters said they believe illegalimmigrants have a favorable impact on the state, compared to 64percent of nonvoters.The poll comes a week after the U.S. Senate began debating a seriesof immigration reforms. The House passed legislation in December thatemphasized employer sanctions and tighter enforcement along theborder.The Republican Party also has endorsed a guest-worker program,which President Bush has said needs to be a central part ofimmigration reform.The Field Poll reported that 65 percent of people surveyed lastmonth said they supported a temporary worker program, which wouldprovide legal status for undocumented laborers. And 70 percent saidthey believed illegal immigrants are generally doing jobs others don'twant.Poll director Mark DiCamillo said Thursday's poll results reflectthe increasing population of noncitizens in the state.``The demographics of California now are very different than thedemographics of California 20 years ago,'' DiCamillo said.California's improving economy and low unemployment also werefactors in the survey results, he said.According to the poll, public attitudes toward undocumentedimmigrants obtaining drivers' licenses are also changing. Of thosesurveyed, 44 percent said they believe illegal immigrants should beable to get licenses, compared to 35 percent one year ago.But again, there are stark differences between those who areregistered to vote and those who are not. Only 33 percentof voterssupport licenses, compared to 61 percent of nonvoters.The federal Real ID Act signed into law on May 11 last yearrequired states to replace current drivers' licenses withforgery-proof identification cards by 2008, but Congress gave statesthe option to create distinct licenses for illegal immigrants.California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed such a bill last year.The poll was based on a random telephone survey of 500 Californiaadults conducted in both English and Spanish over a two-week period inFebruary, according to the director. The sample included 337registered voters and 163 who were not registered to vote. The marginof sampling error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.
The nation's governors told Michael Chertoff, thesecretary of homeland security, on Monday that the new lawexpanding the role of state motor vehicle departments to includenational security responsibilities was presenting enormous financial and logistical challengesthat could take many years to meet.Some governors suggested that the problems might prove so onerous thatCongress might need another approach. The law, known as theReal ID Act, gives states three years to begin verifyingwhether someone seeking or renewing a driver's license is inthe country legally.""Real ID has raised a lot of concerns,"" said Gov. PhilBredesen of Tennessee, a Democrat who was part of abipartisan chorus of criticism made by the governors to reportersafter the meeting. ""People who pass these laws don't necessarilytake into account what it takes to implement them inthe states. Some people expressed the opinion that if youwant to have a national ID card, fine. You needto issue it, not try to get it done in50 states.""The governors met privately with Chertoff on the final day ofthe National Governors Association's summer meetings.Chertoff, speaking to reporters after his 40-minute meeting, described it aspart of ""an ongoing discussion"" with the governors about howto put new programs into practice and to improve existingones.""Everybody's opinion is different,"" he said. ""We'll find a common planto work for everybody.""While the governors said they appreciated Chertoff's words, many seemed nonethelessdaunted by the need to restructure motor vehicle agencies. Underthe new law, workers would need to be trained foradded responsibilities that involved document verification and use of sensitivefederal databases.Many governors were critical of how the law was forced onthem with no consultation. Congress approved the measure in Mayas part of a bill providing $82 billion more forthe fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.""It was attached at the last minute, and it was poorlythought through,"" said Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, a Republicanwho became the new chairman of the governors association.Part of the governors' objection was based on costs. Congress appropriated$100 million for the effort, but Gov. Mark Warner ofVirginia, a Democrat and the outgoing chairman, said upgrading themotor vehicle department in his state alone could cost thatmuch.
Sen. Gil Cedillo, D-Los Angeles, and Democratic lawmakers who supported hisimmigrant driver's license bill are in deep and dangerous denial.Apparently they missed how Congress preempted states on this issue.Five months ago Congress approved the Real ID Act to guidestates in issuing driver's licenses that the federal government wouldrecognize as valid identification to get on an airplane, applyfor Social Security, even enter a post office. Like itor not, and we don't, Congress has turned the driver'slicense into a national identity card. Our Legislature cannot changeor contravene federal law.Cedillo claims his measure conforms with the Real ID Act. Hecannot know that. The regulations aren't expected to be issuedfor another year. So, SB 60 would require California toredesign its driver's licenses to comply with a federal lawthat has no regulations yet for implementing it. The CaliforniaDepartment of Motor Vehicles opposed SB 60 for that reason.As the DMV wrote to Cedillo, ""It would be prematureat this juncture to enact California law that directs thisdepartment to initiate a secondary license procedure until the (federal)rule-making process is concluded."" For those reasons, the governor madeit clear he would not sign SB 60.Serious budgetary issues justify that decision as well. It would costCalifornia millions to create a new driver's license procedure twoyears ahead of what the federal law allows, and inthe end the regulations would almost certainly invalidate those efforts.We sympathize with Cedillo's goal. Driver's licenses ought to validate people'sability to drive competently, not their immigration status. Without avalid driver's license, undocumented immigrants cannot register cars or buyauto insurance. But they still drive, and that means theranks of unlicensed and uninsured drivers in California and nationwidehave swelled.But Cedillo and his supporters in the Legislature can't override thefederal law. The fight belongs in Congress.Sacramento Bee editorial
At a hearing in the state Senate lastweek, California legislators got their first close look at howthe controversial federal Real ID Act will affect the statebudget and ordinary Californians. It was unsettling.Approved by Congress last year, the Real ID Act requires statesto radically change the way they issue driver's licenses ifthey want their residents to be able to use thatdocument as valid identification to board airplanes, enter federal buildings,and apply for a federal job, Social Security or anyother federal benefit.State officials who have met with a working group in Washingtonabout implementation say the law will likely be phased inover a five-year period, beginning in 2008. That means notall 24 million licensed Californians will have to turn intheir driver's licenses at once. That's a big relief.Still, applicants seeking their first license in California or trying toget the old one renewed will find the task moredifficult and expensive.At minimum, California will be forced to suspend its convenient renew-by-mailoption that more than 2 million state drivers used lastyear. That will mean longer lines at the Department ofMotor Vehicles.Besides presenting a birth certificate, applicants will also have to producetwo documents to prove they actually live where they claim.(Federal regulators are expected to exempt most people born before1935.)The state's cost of implementing could go as high as $500million, with individual license holders expected to pay more, possiblydouble the current $26 license fee.When Congress approved the Real ID Act, it was billed asa necessary tool to fight global terrorism. Whether it doesthat is an open question. But it's clear that thenew tool won't be cheap or easy to use.Sacramento Bee editorial
About 9,500 Burmese refugees scheduled to be resettled fromThailand to the United States this year are in limbobecause their indirect support for armed rebels opposed to theirrepressive government has put them in technical violation of Americananti-terrorism law, government officials say.The Burmese are the largest of several groups, including refugees fromCuba, Vietnam, Liberia and Somalia, whose admission to the UnitedStates has been jeopardized by a provision in the USAPatriot Act that denies entry to anyone who has providedmaterial support to a terrorist or armed rebel group. Theprovision applies even if that support was coerced or theaims of the group in question match those of Americanforeign policy.The law broadens the definition of terrorist groups to include organizationsthat do not appear on the State Department's list ofdesignated terrorist groups, effectively barring refugees loosely linked to armedgroups that have resisted authoritarian governments like those in Burmaand Cuba.Some of the refugees paid taxes to rebel groups that controlledtheir communities. Others offered food or small sums to relativesor acquaintances in groups with ties to rebels or wereforced to provide such support, refugee resettlement officials say.Homeland Security and State Department officials have been working for severalmonths to define guidelines for a waiver to the statutethat would allow the resettlement of the refugees, who arefleeing religious, ethnic and political persecution, and refugee officials saidthey were hoping for a resolution soon.But with thousands of families stranded in refugee camps overseas, officialsfrom the United Nations and Republicans and Democrats in Congresshave begun warning in recent weeks that the law isleaving refugees increasingly at risk.The law has already delayed the resettlement of 146 Cubans whooffered support to armed opponents of Fidel Castro in the1960s; 200 Burmese refugees housed in Malaysia; 30 Hmong refugeesin Thailand; 11 Vietnamese Montagnard refugees in Cambodia; and asmall number of Liberians and Somalis, U.N. statistics show.The United Nations is still awaiting a formal decision on thefate of the 9,500 Burmese refugees in Thailand.U.N. officials and members of Congress said the refugees posed noknown security risks to the United States. By tagging themas having links to terrorists, the United Nations says, theBush administration will make it difficult to find other countrieswilling to accept them. It may also lead countries providingthe refugees with temporary shelter to reconsider their welcome.The delay in issuing a waiver to the statute has ledthe United Nations to suspend the American resettlement of hundredsof Colombian refugees, many of whom were forced to makepayments to rebel forces, and of 1,300 Burmese refugees housedin Malaysia, who made donations to ethnic groups linked toarmed opponents of the Burmese government.It has also prevented some 500 asylum seekers in the UnitedStates from being granted permanent refuge here. Many of thosecases are being appealed.""Until this issue is resolved, many deserving refugees and applicants forasylum fleeing religious, ethnic or other forms of persecution willbe unfairly denied or postponed from achieving safe haven,"" Reps.Christopher H. Smith, R-N.J., and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., said ina letter to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff last week.The Patriot Act, which was passed in 2001 and is beingreauthorized by Congress, has been increasingly applied to refugees inthe past two years. So has the Real ID Act,which further broadened the definition of terrorist groups when itwas passed last year.""That procedure should ensure that terrorists do not abuse refugee statusor the asylum laws of the United States,"" Smith andRos-Lehtinen wrote. ""However, the procedure should also properly weigh situationsin which individuals are acting under duress or are legitimatelyresisting illegitimate and tyrannical regimes.""Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and Edward M. Kennedy ofMassachusetts, both Democrats, wrote a similar letter last week.Bill Strassberger, a spokesman for the Homeland Security Department, said hisagency was working with the departments of State and Justiceto resolve the problem.""Part of the consternation over this issue is that this processis taking some time,"" he said. ""The process is madedifficult because of the need to balance national security withour deep commitment to assisting refugees and providing a saferefuge.""Those affected by the law include a Colombian woman forced byrebels to hand over livestock. The rebels killed her husbandand raped her before she escaped the country. Because herforced support for the rebels would bar her from admissionto the United States, the United Nations resettled her inanother country.Researchers from the Human Rights Program at Harvard Law School, whotraveled to Thailand and Malaysia, interviewed scores of additional refugees.Two of them -- one who gave a hat toa cousin who belonged to an opposition group and anotherwho was taxed a basket of rice annually by thegroup -- are among the Burmese who still hope tofind refuge here.Lawyers at the Homeland Security Department have also argued that thelaws now bar the United States from admitting Afghan refugeeswho supported the Northern Alliance in its battle against theTaliban or South Africans who supported the African National Congresswhen it was deemed a terrorist group.The lawyers made that case in January as they tried topersuade a panel of judges to deny asylum to aBurmese woman who had donated money to an opposition group.The woman, a Christian who has been detained in Texassince she entered this country in 2004, said she hadbeen persecuted in Burma for her religious beliefs and herethnicity. The woman, who asked for anonymity because her caseis pending, is still in detention, awaiting the judges' decision.""I am still hoping,"" she said in a telephone interview onFriday.
Mexican President Vicente Fox on Friday condemned the intensification of anti-immigrant measuresadopted by the United States, including the construction of a wallalong the common border.Fox, whose country is one of the main sources of illegal migration to the United States, said in a statement that ""walls are useless.""Fox said that in cases of violence, the Mexican Foreign Ministry will reinforce the denunciations in international fora onviolations of human rights of Mexicans in the United States.US President George W. Bush issued the Real ID Act, which restricts asylum, bans the issuing of drivers licenses to illegal aliens and plans the construction of a wall in southwest United States, along with the Mexican border.
","Mexico's president condemned the Real ID Act, including provisions for the construction of a wall along the common border. Homeland Security waived environmental laws, as the Real ID Act allows, and authorized completion of the border fence. States are finding the financial, logistical and technical demands of the law daunting. A possible unintended effect might be increased unlicensed, uninsured motorists. California opted to offer illegal immigrants separate licenses for driving only, not to be used as official identification. By broadening the definition of terrorist groups, the Real ID Act has complicated the laws regarding refugees resettling in the US. ","The Real ID Act, enacted in May 2005, required that in three years states determine whether driver's license applicants are in the country legally. Civil libertarians and immigration rights activists protested the bill. States blasted the bill because it placed a large burden on them and worker training requirements. They believed the Act grossly underestimated financial, logistical and technological demands. Some states need to amend their laws and others need to overhaul their computing systems to verify the accuracy of documents. The bill is expected to be phased in over a 5-year period, beginning in 2008. ","The Real ID Act restricts asylum, bans drivers' licenses for illegal aliens and allows for construction of a wall along the Mexican border near San Diego which may cause harm to the Tijuana estuary. Vicente Fox has condemned the measure. An editorial claims that denying licenses to undocumented workers will result in fewer licensed and insured drivers and thus less safety. Real ID has some requirements that would necessitate extensive and costly changes to systems used by some states. California is considering a license valid only for driving and not as id for other purposes. ","The Real ID Act, billed as a tool to fight terrorism but appearing as an anti-immigration crusade, became law in May. Governors and motor vehicles officials protested the driver's license portion, citing its impact on their budgets and procedures, as well as the resulting requirements to upgrade computer systems and hire and train employees. California began struggling with issuing unique licenses for illegals. The authorized fence will have severe ecological results. Tens of thousands of refugees were stranded by the act, which denies entry to anyone who helped or was forced to help groups rebelling against even authoritarian regimes. "
D0924,D0924-A,"The European Medicines Agency is to review all drugs in the sameclass as Vioxx after US pharmaceutical giant Merck withdrew thearthritis drug, a spokesman for the agency said Friday.Merck announced a global withdrawal Thursday of Vioxx, a blockbusterarthritis drug, after a study showed it increased the risk of strokesand heart attacks.""We are going to see whether there is a class effect,"" a spokesmanfor the London-based agency said.The US Food and Drug Administration also has said it would study theeffects of other drugs in the same class as the withdrawn drug.Vioxx, which is scientifically known as rofecoxib, has been marketedin more than 80 countries and produced sales of 2.5 billion dollarsin 2003.The European Medicines Agency carried out a review of the drug classwhich includes Vioxx -- known as COX-2 inhibitors -- at the requestof French authorities, but concluded in November 2003 that theproducts did not need to be withdrawn from the market.
Anti-inflammatory drugs like Vioxx, which is being pulled off themarket after it was linked to cardiac problems, could pose similarriskald of the University of Pennsylvania, who led one of the studiesfunded by the two pharmaceutical firms.""I believe this is a class effect"" that includes similar types ofmedication, such as Celebrex or Bextra, FitzGerald said. Bextra,which hit the market in 2001, is Pfizer's newest pain medication.He urged the FDA to change information on packages to warn patientsand doctors of the risks.Pfizer's medical director, Gail Cawkwell, said in a statement that""the data for Celebrex is robust and exceeds, in the length ofpatients in studies and in the size of studies, the data Vioxx has.""
The pharmaceutical firm Merck faces a new class-action lawsuit inCanada, filed on behalf of two people who suffered heart attacksafter taking the company's pain medication Vioxx, which was taken offthe market worldwide because of such risks, plaintiffs' lawyers saidFriday.Similar suits were filed last week in Quebec, British Columbia,Ontario and Saskatchewan, according to the Toronto law Firm RochonGenova.The pharmaceutical group decided on September 30 to pull itsanti-inflammatory drug Vioxx off the shelves after three years ofclinical studies showed that there was an increased risk of stroke orheart attack after 18 months of treatment.In 2003, some 3.4 million prescriptions for Vioxx were written inCanada, according to the law firm.Last week, a consumer group in Quebec filed suit against Merck,charging that it kept Vioxx on the market despite the risks.

A study sponsored by the US Food and Drug Administration estimatesthat Merck painkiller Vioxx, withdrawn from the market in September,could have caused 27,785 heart attacks or deaths since it wasapproved in 1999.The study concluded that Vioxx, known under the chemical namerofecoxib, ""increases the risk of serious coronary heart diseasedefined as acute myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death,"" theFDA study concluded.A high dose increased risk by 3.7-fold and standard-dose by 1.5-foldcompared to a rival drug produced by Pfizer, Celebrex, or celecoxib,the FDA said.The study, published Tuesday, also suggested Merck tried to explainaway signs that showed Vioxx increased the risk of heart attacks, incompany-sponsored clinical trials four years ago.Merck had argued that a comparison between Vioxx and a genericanti-inflammatory drug called naproxen was misleading because thelatter could help protect against heart attacks or strokes.However, the FDA study disputed that, saying naproxen showed ""noprotective effect"" against heart attacks.""The manufacturer attributed this difference to a never-beforerecognized protective effect of Naproxen,"" said the study.""To explain a five-fold difference, Naproxen would have had to be oneof the most potent and effective cardio-protectants known.""On Tuesday the company described the FDA estimates as speculation:""In general, there is no reliable way to measure the actual use inthe population and therefore no reliable way to estimate the actualnumber of events.""Merck pulled the 2.5 billion dollar-a-year-seller Vioxx off themarket on September 30 when an internal study found it doubled therisk of heart attack and stroke after 18 months of continuous use.
Net income plunged 29 percent for pharmaceutical giant Merck &Co. in the third quarter due to costs for withdrawing its arthritisdrug Vioxx from the market, and the company on Thursday said hundredsof lawsuits have been filed related to the drug.Merck, one of the world's top five drug makers, said Thursday itearned $1.33 billion (euro1.06 billion), or 60 cents (48 euro cents)per share. That was down from $1.86 billion, or 82 cents per share,in the July-September period of 2003.It said unsold Vioxx inventory, estimated customer returns and coststo pull the blockbuster drug from the market worldwide totaled $552.6million (euro438.4 million) in the third quarter. That's despite thefact that the company did not announce until the final day of thethird quarter that it was withdrawing Vioxx, a popular treatment forarthritis and acute pain, because a study found it increased risk ofheart attack and stroke.Revenues for the third quarter totaled $5.54 billion (euro4.39billion), down 4 percent from $5.76 billion in the year-ago quarter.Because of lost revenues for Vioxx, which had about $2.5 billion in2003 sales, or 11 percent of total company revenues, Merck saidThursday that fourth-quarter earnings per share will only be 48 cents(38 euro cents) to 53 cents (42 euro cents), with full-year earningsper share at $2.59 to $2.64 (euro2.05 to euro2.09). Last month, Merckhad said the Vioxx recall would slash 50 cents to 60 cents off itsearnings per share for the year; on Thursday, it said the impactwould be 50 cents to 55 cents.For the first nine months of the year, net income declined to $4.71billion (euro3.74 billion), or $2.11 (euro1.67) per share, from $5.44billion, or $2.41 per share. Revenues inched up to $17.19 billion(euro13.64 billion) from $16.86 billion in the January-Septemberperiod of 2003.___On the Net: http://www.merck.com
Shares of Merck & Co. plunged more than 10 percent Monday after amedia report said that documents show the pharmaceutical giant hid ordenied evidence for years that its blockbuster arthritis drug Vioxxcause heart problems.Merck, one of the world's top five drug makers, pulled the arthritisand acute pain drug from the market worldwide on Sept. 30, saying itwas acting in patients' best interest. Vioxx has been taken by about20 million Americans and had produced 11 percent of Merck's totalrevenues.Also on Monday, Prudential Equity Group analyst Tim Andersondowngraded the stock's rating to neutral from overweight. Andersonwrote that he believes there is value in the company's drug pipelinebut said it is likely to get lost in the negative Vioxx coverage.Additionally, Standard & Poor's placed Merck on CreditWatch withnegative implications, which sends a strong signal that the company'sdebt could be downgraded within the next three months. When Merckwithdrew Vioxx, S&P lowered its outlook to negative from stable.The additional, more serious step taken Monday reflects the momentumin the Vioxx litigation and the delay in launching Arcoxia, Vioxx'ssuccessor drugs, said S&P analyst Arthur Wong.Hundreds of lawsuits have been filed against Merck over Vioxx and oneanalyst believes it could cost the company up to $12 billion. LastFriday, the FDA said it wouldn't approve Arcoxia without additionalsafety and efficacy information. Wong said it look like the drug willbe delayed more than a year.Merck shares were down $3.19, or 10.2 percent, at $28.12 on the NewYork Stock Exchange after The Wall Street Journal reported thatinternal e-mails and marketing materials show the company knew as farback as 2000 that Vioxx was linked to an increased risk of heartattack but tried to discredit such evidence.Despite a March 9, 2000 e-mail from Merck research director EdwardScolnick to colleagues conceding an elevated risk of heart attack andstroke was ""clearly there,"" according to the newspaper, Merckcontinued to try to discredit academic researchers critical of thedrug.The Journal reported that one training document from Merck listedpotentially difficult questions about the drug and stated in capitalletters, ""DODGE!""Merck declined comment on the article. Last Friday, Merckacknowledged some sealed trial documents had been made public, notingthat in other similar court cases documents had been leaked toadvance the plaintiffs' lawyers interests. It said that it ""actedresponsibly and appropriately as it developed and marketed Vioxx.""Merck shares had been trading in the $45 range until the withdrawalannouncement, plunged to the mid $30s that day and have hovered justabove $30 since then. The stock price was as high as $49 per share inFebruary and was slightly above $90 at the end of 2000, before therecession.___On the Net: http://www.merck.com
.Last week's decision by Merck to halt sales of Vioxx, its blockbusterpainkiller, could lead to an onslaught of new lawsuits against thecompany.Hundreds and perhaps thousands of new Vioxx lawsuits are likely to befiled, lawyers said, with many of them class actions that aim torepresent large groups of Vioxx users who have taken the drug forextended periods. Indeed, radio advertisements seeking plaintiffs arebeing broadcast and some suits were filed almost immediately afterMerck's recall announcement on Thursday.""Our lawsuit was in the works but the filing was accelerated by therecall,"" said Don S. Strong, a lawyer who filed a suit against Merckon Thursday in U.S.District Court in Oklahoma City.""The recall makes our burden of proof easier,"" Strong said, ""becauseit validates what our experts have been telling us for severalmonths."" The lawsuit says that Strong's client suffered ministrokesand a number of heart problems from taking Vioxx.But some experienced product liability lawyers say a new wave oflitigation may not necessarily be more distracting for Merck than thesuits that are already working their way through the courts.Assuming the Vioxx cases follow the pattern of other major productliability battles, a surge in lawsuits could well encouragecourt-ordered consolidation of the litigation, hastening itsresolution.Whether the decision to recall the product ends up underminingMerck's legal defenses or improving its image to juries is lesspredictable, according to legal experts.""Both sides will try to spin this in their favor,"" said Vincent S.Walkowiak, a Dallas lawyer who has worked for Merck in other casesbut is not involved in the Vioxx litigation. ""The plaintiffs will saythis is confirmation of Vioxx's dangers and Merck will use it toestablish that it is behaving responsibly.""While declining to comment directly on the legal impact of Vioxx'swithdrawal, Theodore V.H. Mayer, a lawyer at Hughes Hubbard &Reed, a firm retained by Merck, said the company ""continues tobelieve it has strong and meritorious defenses to the lawsuitsbrought against it.""Hundreds of lawsuits had been filed against Merck, which is based inWhitehouse Station, N.J., long before last week's recall decision.The lawsuits blame Vioxx -- currently used by about 1.3 millionAmericans and 700,000 arthritis sufferers in other countries -- forheart attacks, strokes and other health problems.They also charge that Merck's aggressive marketing of Vioxx failed todisclose adequately the information the company had about those risksand that Merck did not diligently pursue research into the hazards ofVioxx. Some of the lawsuits include drug distributors and doctors asco-defendants.The decision to recall Vioxx could have an impact on whether the drugis found to be defective, according to Walkowski.Some states have statutes that create a presumption that there is nodefect in drugs and drug labels that have been approved by the Foodand Drug Administration; Vioxx had such approval. It is unclear,though, whether courts will rule that the Vioxx recall eliminatessuch presumptions.If Vioxx is found to be defective under certain state laws, thetiming and the circumstances of the recall could become a factor indetermining whether Merck behaved so negligently or recklessly thatit should pay punitive damages. State laws will be used to determineliability, regardless of whether a case is in state or federal court.""It frames the issue for a jury,"" Walkowiak said.Merck announced that it would withdraw Vioxx from the market after itlearned on Sept. 23 that the drug's users were twice as likely tosuffer heart attacks or strokes as test subjects receiving a placebo.The data came to light in a major clinical trial that Merck had hopedwould show that Vioxx could help prevent colon polyps, which canbecome cancerous.Merck had contested all previous reports that Vioxx was dangerous,contending they were based on faulty or inconclusive research.Several lawsuits have been filed since Thursday, including a classaction against Merck Frosst, the Canadian subsidiary of Merck,brought by a consumers' group in Quebec. Some lawyers, includingthose who had filed suits against Merck before the Vioxx withdrawal,said that they already had plenty of evidence of the drug's dangersbefore last week's announcement.""The evidence is no better,"" said Robert E. Cartwright Jr., a SanFrancisco lawyer whose lawsuits against Merck are among approximately285 similar cases that have been consolidated before a singleCalifornia state judge in Los Angeles.""It was just a matter of time before the recall occurred,"" saidCartwright, whose first case was filed in March 2002.One Vioxx case brought by a plaintiff in Alabama is scheduled fortrial in December.The withdrawal of Vioxx leaves numerous unanswered questions aboutthe extent of the risks it poses. Some plaintiffs could ask Merck tofinance more research into the effects of the drug.The most serious health risks associated with Vioxx seem to appearafter consumers have been taking the drug for 18 months or longer.Merck said Monday that it was still looking into how many Vioxx usersfell into that group. More than 105 million Vioxx prescriptions havebeen filled for about 20 million consumers since the drug was firstsold in August 1999, according to the company.Vioxx's $2.5 billion in sales accounted for about 11 percent ofMerck's revenue last year and, according to analysts' estimates,about $1.2 billion, or 18 percent, of its earnings. The crucial roleVioxx plays in Merck's portfolio was apparent last week when Merck'sshares plunged 27 percent to $33 after the withdrawal announcement.Since then, shares of Merck have rebounded modestly. They rose 92cents Monday, to $34.23.
With Vioxx coming off the pharmacy shelves, what is a patient whotook that drug for pain supposed to do?Call the doctor who prescribed it and talk about alternatives.But while patients need to stop taking Vioxx, local physicians said,it is not always easy to decide on a new course of treatment.""There's not a simple generic answer,"" said Dr. Randel Miller, WatsonClinic rheumatologist.Merck & Co. removed Vioxx from use Thursday after new studyresults showed increased risk of heart attacks and stroke in peoplewho used it for longer than 18 months.Patients on Vioxx for arthritis or other conditions should be gettingletters from their doctors, although they can call them now.Simply switching to stronger doses of over-the-counter pain medicineis not necessarily the right option, doctors said.Some of them have an anti-clotting effect that make patients morelikely to bleed. For patients on blood thinners such as Coumadin, thecombination could be highly risky without proper supervision.And older nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen andnaproxen, typically called NSAIDs, cause gastrointestinal bleeding insome patients. That is one reason doctors and patients welcomed thenew NSAIDs known as Cox-2 inhibitors -- Vioxx, Celebrex and Bextra --as they started entering the market in the 1990s.Their less-upsetting impact on the stomach was a plus, particularlywith older patients.Concern about possible cardiovascular problems associated with Vioxx,however, soon arose.Dr. Ada Lopez-Mendez, a rheumatology specialist at Winter HavenHospital, said patients should return the Vioxx they have.Their doctors can prescribe other Cox-2 inhibitors, or try drugs suchas ibuprofen. They may review patients' conditions to see if theystill need medicine, she and Miller said.Two newer arthritis drugs of the same type are waiting for marketingapproval in the United States, but Miller said they will not bereleased without more review of their cardiovascular risks.On Wednesday, the European Medicines Agency in London announced itwould review all drugs of this type.Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said the risk of anindividual patient having a heart attack or stroke related to Vioxxis small, the agency also said ""there appear to be significant safetyconcerns.""Results of clinical studies with one drug in a given class do notnecessarily apply to other drugs in the same class, the FDA said.That means Vioxx results cannot automatically be extended to Celebrexand Bextra, which are in the Cox-2 classification with Vioxx but arenot identical to it.""There's no evidence we're aware of the other Cox-2 drugs havesimilar effects, but we don't really have studies that are longenough (to know),"" Miller said.But articles released Wednesday by the New England Journal ofMedicine say Vioxx may not be the only drug of its type that raisesthe heart and stroke risk.Studies done five years ago when Pfizer's Celebrex and Merck &Co.'s Vioxx were approved suggest the same mechanism that inhibitsinflammation and makes them easier on the stomach than traditionalpainkillers also blocks a substance that prevents heart problems,according to Dr. Garret FitzGerald, chairman of pharmacology at theUniversity of Pennsylvania.He led the studies, which were designed by him but funded by the drugcompanies.FitzGerald said he thinks the problem of increased risk also appliesto Pfizer's Celebrex and Bextra.Pfizer's medical director, Dr. Gail Cawkwell, insisted that its drugsare safe. ""The data for Celebrex is robust and exceeds, in the lengthof patients in studies and in the size of studies, the data Vioxxhas,"" she said.She called FitzGerald's contention ""an interesting theory,"" but said,""there is no evidence"" of increased risk of heart problems among the75 million Americans who have taken Celebrex. Long-term studies arenot yet available on Bextra, approved in 2001.The FDA needs to give more guidance in using the remaining COX-2inhibitors, Fitzgerald said in the Journal article.He said the drugs remain a ""rational choice"" for patients at low riskof cardiovascular problems who have had serious gastrointestinalevents (such as bleeding), but he said it would ""seem prudent"" toavoid them with patients who have or are at risk of cardiovasculardisease.In a separate report released by the New England Journal, Dr. EricTopol of the Cleveland Clinic chastises the FDA for not requiringMerck to do studies investigating heart problems with Vioxx whenhints of them first appeared years ago.""This represents the largest prescription-drug withdrawal in history,but had the many warning signs along the way been heeded, such adebacle could have been prevented,"" he said.The medical journal published their reports Wednesday on the Internet-- more than two weeks ahead of their planned publication to helpinform doctors and patients.Until the new study, Vioxx seemed the best alternative for somepatients despite a caution on its label from an earlier study.That included patients for whom older NSAIDs had not controlled painand patients who have sulfa allergies, of which Celebrex and Bextracan trigger a recurrence, Watson Clinic's Miller said.""There's a lot of individual variability in medicines,"" he said.""You have one person do extremely well with a drug and on the otherit wouldn't work.""The trial whose results pulled Vioxx off the market was designed tocheck how well 25 mg of Vioxx did in preventing recurrence of polypsin the colon.It was not stopped earlier because trial results did not findincreased risk in the first 18 months of the trial, the FDA said.They were discovered later.The results of that study came on the heels of an earlier study thatshowed a greater number of heart attacks in patients taking Vioxx,although there were fewer stomach ulcers and bleeding. Informationfrom the earlier study went on the Vioxx label in April 2002,according to the FDA.Although that study's findings did not cause Vioxx to be withdrawn,Miller and Lopez-Mendez said the results put Vioxx lower on theirlist for prescribing.Another study -- this one released in August on a review of more than1 million HMO patients -- found a three-fold risk of cardiovascularincidents in patients taking 25 mg or more Vioxx, Lopez-Mendez said.The risk was only slightly greater than average with less than 25milligrams, she said, adding that the American College ofRheumatology sent members the results of that presentation daysbefore Merck withdrew Vioxx. That could have made many less likely toprescribe it.""When there are other alternatives, why risk trying to use the drugthat might have elevated risk?"" said Lopez-Mendez, medical directorof rehabilitation services at Winter Haven Hospital. FOR MOREINFORMATION:
Hundreds of plaintiffs' lawyers who claim that people were injured orkilled by the painkiller Vioxx plan to meet next week to laygroundwork for a nationwide legal assault against the drug's maker,Merck.The lawyers expect the discussions to begin informally on Tuesday inPasadena, Calif., in the hallways of a conference on Vioxx litigationthat will also be open to defense lawyers. On Thursday, at a meetingin Las Vegas for the plaintiffs' lawyers only, those who are suingMerck, or plan to, expect to discuss specific strategies.""We can't compete with big pharmaceutical companies by ourselves, butwhen we get together, we can become formidable,"" said Daniel E.Becnel Jr., a lawyer in Reserve, La., who has led such organizationalefforts in other drug cases and in tobacco litigation. ""This is acase that needs to be managed by the premier lawyers in the country.""J. Michael Papantonio, a lawyer in Pensacola, Fla., who organized theLas Vegas meeting, said about 500 plaintiffs' lawyers were expectedto attend.Even before Merck pulled Vioxx from the market on Sept. 30, citingwhat it said was new evidence that the drug increased the risk ofheart attacks, strokes and other serious ailments, hundreds ofpatients had filed lawsuits around the country. Since then, countlessother lawsuits have been brought -- no one yet has an accurate figure-- and more are expected.Merck, which has said it pulled the drug as soon as it had conclusiveevidence of unacceptable risk, declined to discuss its defensestrategy.This week, the incentives to sue have multiplied. The Food and DrugAdministration published a report on its Web site on Tuesday by astaff researcher, concluding that more than 27,000 deaths could beattributed to Vioxx based on comparisons with how patients takingother painkillers had fared.On Thursday, the Lancet, a respected British medical journal,published an analysis of all the clinical trials of Vioxx completedby 2001, and concluded that Merck and the FDA should have knownenough about the drug's hazards to withdraw it years ago.The plaintiffs' lawyers plan to compare notes next week on the typesof clients who may make the strongest cases, with a premium on peoplewho were in demonstrably good health before taking Vioxx.The group also intends to discuss ways to cooperate in gatheringevidence and expert testimony, and in devising tactics to influencewhere the bulk of the cases may end up, as state and federal judgesconsolidate them. Until such matters are resolved, how soon any ofthe cases may come to trial is uncertain, including one that had beenexpected to begin as early as next month in federal court inBirmingham, Ala.Many lawyers will also be jockeying for roles that will maximizetheir influence, and ultimately their reimbursement, as thelitigation unfolds.More than 20 million Americans have used Vioxx since it went on themarket in 1999. Millions more used the drug overseas. Based on thenumber of Vioxx customers and the seriousness of the injuries, theVioxx lawsuits would appear to have the potential to dwarf recentcases like the one against Baycol, a cholesterol-lowering drug usedby about 700,000 Americans, and the one against the diet supplementfen-phen, which an estimated 6 million people took.Baycol's maker, the Bayer Group of Germany, said in late Septemberthat it had paid $1.09 billion to settle 2,861 lawsuits and that7,577 suits were pending. And Wyeth, the marketer of fen-phen, facescontinuing legal battles with plaintiffs who opted out of asettlement program that pays victims from a $3.75 billion trust fund.Wyeth has set aside $16.6 billion to cover its liabilities.Many plaintiffs' lawyers say it is too early to make a realisticassessment of Merck's financial vulnerability. Merck, the nation'ssecond-largest drugmaker, has long been among the nation's strongestcompanies financially, with a credit rating among the highest inAmerican business.In their meetings next week, the lawyers are likely to weigh thepotential impact of this week's national elections, whichstrengthened the Republican-led effort to curb product liabilitylawsuits. A related concern for the plaintiffs' lawyers is the FDA'scontinuing efforts under the Bush administration to persuade judgesthat FDA approval of a drug, along with warnings on the label, shouldgo a long way toward shielding the maker from lawsuits.So far, most state judges have rejected the FDA immunity argument.But if courts began to accept it -- or Congress made it the law ofthe land -- plaintiffs' lawyers would have the higher hurdle ofarguing that Merck deceived the FDA by hiding or distorting damagingdata. That case would be hard to make without supportive testimonyfrom the agency, some lawyers said.The personal injury lawsuits -- or tort cases, as lawyers call them-- can be filed in state or federal courts and in many cases nameother parties, like doctors or drug distributor, as co-defendantswith Merck.In the hundreds of Vioxx lawsuits filed before Merck took the drugoff the market, the action was primarily in New Jersey, where Merckis based, and the big states of Texas and California. But thefinancial burden of taking on a giant like Merck while it continuedto insist that Vioxx was safe and effective scared away many lawyers.""It's been a quiet little mass tort for a long time,"" said CarleneRhodes Lewis, a Houston lawyer whose firm was among the pioneers whenit began filing Vioxx complaints in 2001. Lewis and her partners tookon nearly 300 such cases by the time Merck pulled the plug on Vioxx.Merck's withdrawal of Vioxx has made it much easier for lawyers toargue to a jury that the product should not have been on the market.But proving liability could still be difficult.The data from clinical studies suggest, so far, that the most serioushealth problems hit patients who had used Vioxx for 18 months orlonger. Merck has said it does not know yet how large that group is.In addition, many possible Vioxx victims may find it difficult to pintheir health problems on the drug if forced to go to trial, lawyerswho filed the early cases said. The injuries linked to Vioxx are alsocommon among people who have not used the drug, and they have manycauses.""The person who should never have taken Vioxx and should have beenwarned by Merck, the person with multiple risks of cardiac problems,may not make the best client, because it may be harder to prove thatVioxx caused the heart attack,"" said Cynthia Anne Solomon, a lawyerin Mt. Pleasant, S.C.As a result, the pioneering plaintiffs' lawyers in the Vioxxlitigation have been carefully screening potential clients in searchof those who were relatively healthy before they took the drug andsuffered injuries. Some of those lawyers said they were worried thatlawyers who rushed into the field after Merck withdrew the drug,including law firms soliciting clients with radio and printadvertising, will muddy the legal landscape with questionable claims.""For every hundred calls we get, there are only two or three top-endcases,"" Papantonio said.He and others said that Merck, if it follows the course of other drugcompanies in similar situations, is likely to try to settle thestrongest cases against it and fight some of the weaker claims intrials. If it wins those trials, it could knock down the settlementvalue of the vast majority of claims against it and cut billions ofdollars from its potential exposure.Merck recently asked the panel of judges that supervises the way masstorts are handled in federal courts to assign all of the lawsuits toone judge. Becnel filed a similar petition.The panel is expected to hear arguments on the petitions and wherethe cases should be consolidated at its January meeting.Many lawyers involved in the lawsuits say the federal consolidationprocess should hasten final settlement of most of the Vioxx cases.The state cases in New Jersey and California have already gonethrough such a process.But the effort to centralize the federal cases while sorting outwhich cases will remain in state courts -- where plaintiffs' lawyersusually prefer them -- could very likely lead to procedure battlesthat may delay the first Vioxx trials. Several were on course tobegin in the next few months.""It's up in air now,"" said Andy D. Birchfield Jr., a lawyer inMontgomery, Ala., who had expected to begin trying a Vioxx case infederal court in Birmingham as soon as next month.
","Merck & Co. withdrew its arthritis drug Vioxx from the market in 2004 after a trial showed it increased heart attacks and strokes. Merck's net income plunged 29% after the announcement. The European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration announced they would review all COX-2 inhibitors to see if there was a class effect. Hundreds, possibly thousands of lawsuits were likely to be filed against Merck, lawyers said, including many class action lawsuits, all claiming injury from taking Vioxx. Plaintiffs' cases were strengthened when proof was uncovered that Merck knew about Vioxx's risk but discounted it. ","Merck withdrew Vioxx when a study showed it increased the risk of strokes and heart attacks. An FDA study estimates Vioxx may have caused 27,785 attacks/deaths since its approval. The medical community was concerned about use of related drug use and sought more guidance. Lawyers estimated thousands of lawsuits would be filed against Merck. One settlement estimate was $12 billion. Merck's costs to withdraw Vioxx from the market were $552.6 million and their profits for the third quarter of 2004 dropped 29 percent. Several medical reports criticized Merck's failing to stop Vioxx when data first showed its potential danger. ","Merck has recalled its popular arthritis medicine Vioxx. Use of Vioxx may increase risk of stroke and heart attack. This is the largest prescription drug recall in history and could lead to an onslaught of lawsuits. Vioxx is used by 1.3 million Americans and 700,000 in other countries and accounts for sales of $2.5B. Class action lawsuits have been filed in Canadian Provinces. Hundreds of plaintiffs lawyers expected to meet in Las Vegas to plan class action strategy. The US Food and Drug Administration estimates Vioxx could have caused more than 27,000 heart attacks. Merck income has dropped 29%. ","The European Medicines Agency and the US FDA vowed to review drugs in the same class as Vioxx. The FDA said over 27,000 deaths could be attributed to Vioxx. Lancet concluded Merck and the FDA should have withdrawn Vioxx. Many new individual and class action Vioxx lawsuits were filed in the US and Canada, representing patients, Merck shareholders, and former employees with company retirement plans. Radio ads sought plaintiffs for class action suits. Merck requested that one judge handle all the lawsuits. Plaintiffs' lawyers planned to meet in Las Vegas to lay groundwork. Merck share price and earnings were reduced. "
D0924,D0924-B,"US pharmaceutical giant Merck on Friday disputed the conclusion ofthe British medical weekly The Lancet that the arthritis drug Vioxxshould have been pulled from the market four years earlier.Merck said it posted a scientific critique on its website ""to furtherclarify for the scientific community why Merck disagrees with theconclusions"" of The Lancet.The Lancet report said there was enough evidence four years agolinking the drug to an increased risk of strokes and heart attacks.Merck claimed however that ""it was vigilant in monitoring anddisclosing the cardiovascular safety"" of Vioxx and added that thecompany ""absolutely disagrees with any implication to the contrary.""The statement said the scientific critique details why Merckdisagrees with analysis of The Lancet and added that until a studythis year, ""data from Merck's clinical trials showed no significantdifference in cardiovascular risk"" of Vioxx.The British journal strongly criticized the US drug company, whichwithdrew the drug from the market in September, for failing to stopmarketing the drug in 2000 when data showed Vioxx was potentiallydangerous.""The licensing of Vioxx and its continued use in the face ofunambiguous evidence of harm have been public health catastrophes,""editor Richard Horton said in a commentary. ""This controversy willnot end with the drug's withdrawal.""Merck withdrew Vioxx based on the results of an internal three-yearstudy of 2,600 patients, half of whom received a 25 milligram dose ofVioxx and half of whom received a placebo.
Drugs giant Merck and Co.'s shares slumped Tuesday after the firmrevealed civil and criminal investigations into the sale of its paindrug Vioxx.In the first half hour of trade, Merck shares dropped 55 cents, or2.1 percent, to 26.02 dollars, completing a 42.3 percent plunge inthe past six weeks.In a public filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)on Monday, Merck said it had been told of an informal SEC inquiryinto Vioxx.The firm said it had also received a subpoena from the US Departmentof Justice asking for information about its research, marketing andsales of Vioxx in a criminal health care investigation.""The company will cooperate with the SEC and the Justice Department,""Merck said in the filing.""The company cannot predict the outcome of these inquiries; however,it is possible that highly unfavorable outcomes, including apotential civil disposition from the SEC and/or potential civil orcriminal dispositions from the Justice Department, could have amaterial adverse effect on the companys financial position, liquidityand results of operations,"" it said.Merck pulled the 2.5-billion-dollar-a-year seller Vioxx off themarket on September 30, when an internal study found it doubled therisk of heart attack and stroke after 18 months of continuous use.A study sponsored by the US Food and Drug Administration estimatedthat Vioxx could have caused 27,785 heart attacks or deaths since itwas approved in 1999.Merck has disputed a report in the British medical weekly The Lancet,however, that there was enough evidence four years ago linking thedrug to an increased risk of strokes and heart attacks.A rash of lawsuits now plagues the firm because of the global Vioxxwithdrawal. Merck said it was unsure if its insurance would provideenough money to cover potential lawsuit losses.
An expert with the Federal Drug Administration on Thursday accusedthe agency in Congress of having pressed him to withhold results of astudy showing potential dangers of the anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx.""I was pressured to change my conclusions and recommendations, andbasically threatened that if I did not change them, I would not bepermitted to present the paper at the conference,"" said David Graham,Associate Director for Science with the office of Drug Safety at theFDA.Graham testified Thursday at a Senate hearing about his 2001-2004study.""One drug safety manager recommended that I should be barred frompresenting the poster at the meeting and also noted that Merck neededto know our study results,"" he said.Merck, the maker of Vioxx, which was approved by the FDA in 1999,voluntarily took the drug off the market in September.Merck withdrew Vioxx based on the results of an internal three-yearstudy of 2,600 patients, half of whom received a 25 mg dose of Vioxxand half of whom received a placebo.The company said these patients, treated with Vioxx to thwart theresurgence of colorectal polyps, a common precursor to cancer, showedno undesirable effects during the first 18 months of the study begunin 2000.However, said Peter Kim, president of Merck Research Laboratory,""while the cause of these results is uncertain at this time, theysuggest an increased risk of confirmed cardiovascular eventsbeginning after 18 months of continuous therapy.""Graham said: ""the problem you are confronting today is immense inscope. Vioxx is a terrible tragedy and a profound regulatory failure.I would argue that the FDA, as currently configured, is incapable ofprotecting America against another Vioxx.""""The corporate culture within CDRE is also a barrier to effectivelyprotecting the American people from unecessary harm due toprescription,"" he said.
Drug maker Merck & Co. said that the Securities and ExchangeCommission and the Justice Department are looking into the company'shandling of Vioxx, the blockbuster arthritis drug it pulled off themarket Sept. 30 after safety studies showed it increased the risk ofheart attacks.In a regulatory filing Tuesday, Merck said the company is the subjectof a criminal investigation from the Justice Department, whichsubpoenaed documents on the company's research, marketing and sellingactivities for Vioxx. The company estimates 105 million prescriptionswere written for the drug for 20 million patients in the UnitedStates from May 1999 to August 2004. In 2003, Vioxx had U.S. sales ofabout $1.8 billion.The SEC also told the company it was beginning its own informalinquiry regarding the drug.Merck said it has also received a letter from the attorneys generalin five states stating that its return and refund program for unusedVioxx will not provide consumers with adequate notice and will beunduly burdensome.Merck said that it will cooperate with all information requests andinvestigations.Shares of Merck fell 43 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $26.14 in theextended session after closing up 36 cents to $26.57 on the New YorkStock Exchange.

Merck said the Justice Department had launched a criminalinvestigation into its handling of Vioxx, the blockbuster pain-killingdrug that it withdrew from the market after a study found long-termuse increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes. The companywarned that government probes, along with civil lawsuits, could have``highly unfavorable outcomes'' for investors. Moody's, meanwhile,dropped Merck's credit rating to reflect the sudden loss of revenueand new litigation exposure.
With its stock price down sharply since pulling the painkillerVioxx off the market, Merck & Co. adopted a plan guaranteeing largeseverance packages to 230 top executives if the company merges or istaken over. The timing of the ``golden parachutes,'' and theirextension to so many executives, drew complaints from critics who saidthe firm's managers didn't deserve such a rich package after the Vioxxfiasco. Separately, a major pension fund filed suit against Merck,alleging it misled shareholders about the safety of Vioxx.
Nearly a year before Merck received results from the clinical trialthat prompted the company to pull its painkiller Vioxx from themarket, the company received preliminary results from a separatestudy of patient records that also apparently indicated the drugposed cardiovascular risks.Merck has not publicly disclosed that separate study's results orreferred to it in any of its recent statements about Vioxx's safetyrecord since announcing in late September that it would stop sellingthe drug. But a company spokeswoman, in response to a reporter'squestions Wednesday, confirmed the study's existence and said thatMerck, which paid for the research, had received its preliminaryresults last November -- and was given a final report 10 days beforethe company announced it would stop selling Vioxx.Joan Wainwright, the Merck spokeswoman, said that the separate study,because it was based on patient records and not on an actual clinicaltrial, was inconclusive and had no bearing on the decision towithdraw Vioxx. When it withdrew the drug from the market, Merckcited a long-term trial showing that some patients, after takingVioxx for 18 months, developed serious cardiovascular problems. ButMerck's critics continue to say that the company should have heededsignals years earlier that Vioxx might pose dangers.The company's chief executive, Raymond V. Gilmartin, is expected tobe interrogated on the matter on Thursday in a hearing by the SenateFinance Committee, which will also be examining the Food and DrugAdministration's handling of Vioxx and other drug safety issues.The study report that Merck received on Sept. 20 was an analysis ofpatient records from the UnitedHealth Group. It compared the relativerates of heart attack and stroke in people taking Vioxx, a similardrug Celebrex and traditional over-the-counter painkillers.Wainwright said that the company, as a matter of policy, did notdiscuss study findings before their public release. But one personwho was briefed on the data and who spoke on the condition ofanonymity said that the results indicated that Vioxx posed anincreased risk of cardiovascular problems, compared with the otherdrugs studied.Wainwright said that the study had been submitted for potentialpublication in a medical journal that she declined to identify andthat there had been no intentional effort to delay disclosing theresults.The Senate hearing comes after the disclosure in recent weeks ofinternal Merck documents that suggest that the company may haveside-stepped questions about Vioxx's safety for several years andused hardball marketing tactics to allay doctors' concerns about thepainkiller.An FDA drug reviewer, Dr. David Graham, has claimed that agencysuperiors discounted his efforts to call attention to the drug'sproblems. Graham's main evidence is a study of patient records fromthe Kaiser Permanente health care system, which is similar inapproach to the UnitedHealth Care study that Merck commissioned.
The pension fund of New York State filed a federal lawsuit Mondayagainst Merck & Co. that accused Merck of misleading shareholdersabout the safety of its now-withdrawn arthritis pain drug, Vioxx.The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Trenton, N.J., said thatthe pension fund lost about $171 million on Sept. 30 when thecompany, citing increased heart risks in tests of people using thedrug for more than 18 months, withdrew it from the market. On thatday, the price of a share of Merck stock plummeted 27 percent. Merckshares are down about 40 percent for the year, but closed up 35 centsMonday, at $28.02.The lawsuit appears to be the first by a pension fund against Merck.A spokeswoman for Merck, Joan Wainwright, said that about 15 lawsuitshad been filed asserting that the company misled shareholders havebeen filed. Merck is based in Whitehouse Station, N.JSeveral hundred personal injury lawsuit have also been filed againstMerck by people claiming to have been injured Vioxx. The company hasdenied any wrongdoing.In a statement issued Monday, the New York State comptroller, Alan G.Hevesi, maintained that Merck knew, but failed to disclose, that agrowing body of evidence indicated that users of Vioxx were atincreasing risk of suffering heart attacks, strokes and death.""Merck must be held legally responsible for its actions,"" saidHevesi, who is also the pension fund's trustee. ""These actions haveput lives at risk and cost shareholders billions of dollars.""In the lawsuit, Hevesi is seeking unspecified monetary damages.Along with the company, the lawsuit names several individualsincluding the chief executive, Raymond V. Gilmartin.Merck executives have disputed suggestions that they acted improperlyand said that they moved promptly to withdraw Vioxx from the marketafter patients in a clinical trial experienced an increased rate ofcardiovascular problems after 18 months of using the drug.""""Merck extensively studied Vioxx before seeking regulatory approvalto market it,"" the spokeswoman, Wainwright, said. ""We promptlydisclosed the clinical data about Vioxx. When questions arose, wetook additional steps, including conducting further prospective,controlled studies to gain more clinical information.""She said that Merck had not seen Hevesi's lawsuit and could notcomment.In his lawsuit, Hevesi cited recent newspaper reports, broadcastreports and medical journal articles that have raised questions aboutMerck's handling of safety issues surrounding Vioxx.The safety questions first emerged soon after Vioxx was approved in1999 for sale by federal regulators.In 2000, for instance, a major clinical trial of the drug found thatthose taking it had a fivefold increased risk of heart attackcompared to patients in the trial who took a comparative painreliever, naproxen.However, until recently, Merck executives said that those results didnot reflect any dangers posed by Vioxx but rather that thecardioprotective effect of naproxen.John Chartier, a spokesman for Hevesi, said that at end of Septemberthe New York State pension fund owned about 9.4 million shares ofMerck.In the lawsuit filed Monday in Trenton, Hevesi is asking the court toconsolidate all securities-related claims against Merck in connectionwith Vioxx into a single class action and to make him the leadplaintiff. He also filed a separate but related lawsuit Monday inU.S. District Court in New Orleans.The New York State Common Retirement Fund, as the pension fund isofficially known, is the second-largest public pension fund in thecountry after the California fund.It has approximately $120.8 billion in assets and more than 970,000retirees, beneficiaries and members.
","In November, 2004, government and expert witnesses told a Senate committee that Federal regulators and Merck & Co. were aware of risks that Vioxx could cause serious heart problems before the drug was approved in 1999. In Congress, an FDA expert accused the agency of having pressed him to withhold results of a study showing dangers posed by Vioxx. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department began investigations of Merck's handling of the drug. A study by the FDA estimated that Vioxx could have caused 27,785 heart attacks or deaths since its approval in 1999. ","The SEC and the Justice Department studied Merck's handling of Vioxx. Merck was unsure whether their insurance would be adequate against lawsuits. Moody's dropped Merck's credit rating because of litigation exposure. A clinical trial of Celebrex, a drug similar to Vioxx, was shut down when researchers found increased risk of heart disease and stroke A Senate Committee heard testimony that Merck and the FDA were aware of the Vioxx risks before the drug was approved. Merck adopted a plan to protect 230 of their top executives in case financial trouble necessitated a takeover. ","Merck disputed the British weekly, Lancet, that Vioxx should have been recalled four years earlier. Merck is the subject of a Justice Department criminal investigation and an SEC inquiry. The company's shares slumped on that news. The New York state pension fund filed a lawsuit against Merck. Nearly a year before Merck received results of the clinical trial prompting recall of Vioxx, patient records indicated the drug posed a cardiovascular risk. A drug safety expert at FDA accused the agency of pressing him to withhold a study showing the dangers of Vioxx. Merck has adopted large severance packages for executives. ",Regulators and Merck were accused of knowing Vioxx risks pre-approval. An FDA drug reviewer claimed superiors pressed him to withhold study results showing Vioxx risks. Merck confirmed seeing results showing risk one year before Vioxx was pulled. The SEC and Justice Department instituted civil and criminal investigations into Merck's handling of Vioxx. State attorneys general criticized Merck's return and refund program. New York State's pension fund lost $171 million and filed suit against Merck for misleading shareholders. Merck was criticized for offering 230 executives large severance packages. A Celebrex clinical trial was halted after researchers found risks similar to Vioxx's. 
D0925,D0925-A,"Apple Computer is expected to announce Monday that it will begin using Intel chips in its Macintosh machines next year, ending a 14-year alliance with IBM and its processors, according to US media reports.The move is a major change in strategy for Apple, according to The Wall Street Journal's online edition. The New York Times called it ""an unprecedented gamble.""""This is a seismic shift in the world of personal computing and consumer electronics,"" Richard Doherty, president of a computer and consumer electronics industry consulting firm, told the Times.""It is bound to rock the industry, but it will also be a phenomenal engineering challenge for Apple,"" he said.Apple CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs is set to announce the switch Monday at Apple's annual developer's conference in San Francisco, the reports said.The change could cause disruptions for Macintosh users as software developers scramble to make Apple programs run on Intel chips.But it is a high-profile win for Intel, the world's largest chip maker, which is trying to adjust after the erosion of its long-term partnership with Microsoft, the papers said.""For IBM, the end of the Apple partnership means the loss of a prestigious customer, but not one that is any longer very important to IBM's sales or profits,"" according to The New York Times.IBM has long since expanded beyond the personal computer market. It makes chips for Sony and Nintendo's video game machines as well as specialized processors for Internet routers and for cell phone technology.Microsoft dealt Intel a blow last year when it said it would use an IBM processor in its next generation video game console, the Xbox 360, due to hit stores later this year.""It is likely that Intel forged the alliance with Apple in an effort to counter the powerful home entertainment and game systems coming from Microsoft and Sony,"" the Times said.Apple for its part had tried to counter the Microsoft-Intel partnership when it forged the alliance in 1991 with IBM and Motorola.Today, IBM supplies about half of the microprocessors used by Apple, and Freescale Semiconductor, a spinoff of Motorola, supplies the rest.But in recent times Apple has been alarmed by IBM's failure to update its Power PC chip, the Times said, citing analysts.
Apple Computer, for years a niche operator, took another step toward the market mainstream Monday by abandoning IBM chips in favour of Intel ones to power its trendy Macintosh machines.Chief executive Steve Jobs told 3,800 software developers attending an annual Apple conference here that new Macs will come with Intel microprocessors ""by this time next year"".Under the alliance with the world's biggest chip maker, all Apple Macs will be equipped to handle Intel rather than IBM processors by the end of 2007.""Our goal is to provide our customers with the best personal computers in the world, and looking ahead Intel has the strongest processor roadmap by far,"" Jobs said.""It's been 10 years since our transition to the (IBM) PowerPC, and we think Intel's technology will help us create the best personal computers for the next 10 years,"" he said.The switch to Intel chips, which are already found on most computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system, could allow Apple to cut prices of its desirable but expensive systems.The company has been trying hard to cash in on the runaway success of its iPod digital music player, recently launching a ""Mac Mini"" computer to lure customers away from Windows PCs.However, analysts said that Apple's fanatically loyal fan base may yet look askance at the Intel tie-up.""The world associates Intel with Windows,"" said Elise Bauer of the Pacifica Group technology consultancy.""Intel is coupled with Windows to the point where we call it a 'Wintel' box. If Apple is now embracing Intel, then there's some rebranding for both companies, Intel and Apple, to do around that,"" she said.Software developers will have to rewrite Apple programs to enable them to run on Intel-powered Macs.Apple could also lose sales in the coming months as customers wait for the switch to the more powerful Intel processors.But Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster predicted that the long-term gains from the new partnership will outweigh any ""short-term pain"".Using Intel will give Apple a consistent supply of chips, bring the price of Macs more in line with their competitors, and reach a potentially larger developer community, Munster said.Intel expressed delight at Apple's switch.""We are thrilled to have the world's most innovative personal computer company as a customer,"" said Intel chief executive Paul Otellini, who was introduced to the conference here by an exuberant Jobs.""Apple helped found the PC industry and throughout the years has been known for fresh ideas and new approaches,"" Otellini said.""We look forward to providing advanced chip technologies, and to collaborating on new initiatives, to help Apple continue to deliver innovative products for years to come.""IBM minimised the development. It has sold its PC division to Chinese group Lenovo and, in the chip market, is concentrating its efforts on making powerful processors for games machines made by Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo.In a statement, the company said it was ""aggressively moving the power architecture beyond the PC"".Apple was said to be unhappy with IBM's slow pace of development of a G5 chip for its PowerBook and iBook laptop computers. The chip is already used in Mac desktops but generates too much heat for the laptops.At least one of the software developers at the San Francisco conference said that Jobs' reversal will make it easier for them to write programs for both the Apple and Windows systems.""We won't have to release two copies of applications for different platforms,"" said Jiva DeVoe, whose Arizona software firm makes project-management applications.
A stormy, decade-long relationship between Apple Computer Inc. and IBM is over,according to published reports.Apple CEO Steve Jobs is expected to announce Monday morning at the company'ssoftware developers conference in San Francisco that Apple will discontinueusing microprocessor chips made by IBM in favor of Intel chips, according toCNET Networks Inc.'s News.com and The Wall Street Journal.Officials from Apple, Intel Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.could not be reached Sunday to confirm the report.For years, rumors of Apple's wish to jump to Intel have been circulating. Buttwo weeks ago, analysts were skeptical when The Wall Street Journal reportedthat Intel and Apple were in negotiations.One reason for the skepticism is that the move represents a significant risk forCupertino, California-based Apple.Switching to Intel's x86 chips would force Apple's programmers to rewrite itssoftware in order to adapt to the new processor.""I don't know that Apple's market share can survive another architecture shift,""Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood told News.com. ""Every time they do this,they lose more customers.""News.com reported that Apple would begin the transition to Intel with itslower-end computers, such as the Mac Mini, in mid-2006 and higher-end models ayear later.Apple's break with IBM stemmed from Jobs' wish that IBM make a larger variety ofthe PowerPC processors used in Macintosh systems. IBM balked because of concernsover the profitability of a low-volume business, News.com reported.By wrestling away Apple's business from IBM, Intel tightens its stranglehold onthe PC processor business. The company holds more than an 80 percent share ofthe market.Although IBM suffers a setback with the loss of Apple, the company could reap afinancial windfall from deals with Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony Corp. to putmicroprocessors it is producing in next-generation video-gameconsoles.A new microprocessor that IBM co-developed with Sony and Toshiba Corp,code-named Cell and planned for Sony's next PlayStation console, is being toutedas capable of delivering 10 times the performance of today's PCprocessors.
In a risky move that could further shrink its minuscule slice of the PC market,Apple Computer Inc. announced plans Monday to switch its Macintosh computers tothe same Intel Corp. chips used in systems that run MicrosoftWindows.Apple, which for years suggested its users ""Think Different,"" will join allother PC makers in using microprocessors built on the x86 architecture. Thetechnology took root when IBM launched its first PC in 1981 and eventuallyturned Apple into a niche player.""Our goal is to provide our customers with the best personal computers in theworld, and looking ahead Intel has the strongest processor roadmap by far,"" saidSteve Jobs, Apple's CEO. ""It's been ten years since our transition to thePowerPC, and we think Intel's technology will help us create the best personalcomputers for the next ten years.""Jobs said Apple will begin offering Macs with Intel processors by June 2006 andwill switch its entire product line by the end of 2007.
While Apple Computer Inc.'s new embrace of Intel Corp. microprocessors leavesIBM in the cold, the news really isn't bad for Big Blue, which may have foundthe Apple account more trouble than it was worth.For one thing, IBM Corp. derived relatively little revenue from making its""Power"" brand of chips for Apple's Macintosh computers, which own about 2percent of the global market.IBM's future chip plans are focused elsewhere _ notably the next generation ofvideo game consoles made by Microsoft Corp., Sony Corp. and Nintendo Co. IBM'schips also power several kinds of IBM server computers, which account for a hugechunk of the company's hardware revenue.Both kinds of machines require such high levels of performance that it becomesan expensive and challenging proposition to adapt their chips for personalcomputers, especially mobile devices that present stricter energy and coolingrequirements.So while winning Apple's business gives Intel some bragging rights, ceasing tomake chips for Macs will let IBM focus on markets it believes can be muchbigger.""It's never a happy time when you lose a customer, no matter how large they are,but Apple's impact on the PC market is marginal at best these days,"" saidCharles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT Research. ""It will have more of a PRimpact than a financial impact.""Added SG Cowen Co. analyst Steve Weber: ""This move will likely haveindiscernible impact.""IBM shares were down 67 cents, 0.9 percent, at $75.12 in afternoon trading onthe New York Stock Exchange.IBM declined to comment on Apple's announcement Monday other than to release astatement reiterating its chip strategy. ""IBM is aggressively moving the Powerarchitecture beyond the PC,"" the statement said.While most computer companies long ago abandoned chip manufacturing toindustry-standard suppliers such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., IBMhas stayed with it as part of a broader strategy to distinguish the company asan innovative, high-end tech provider. That desire to focus on top-tier marketsmotivated the recent spinoff of IBM's PC business to China's Lenovo GroupLtd.With IBM's internal chip needs falling short of the company's manufacturingcapacity _ and demand from outside companies such as Apple only tepid _ IBM'smicroelectronics division lost $252 million (now euro205 million) in 2003, thelast year in which IBM released detailed figures. The segment grew at a paltry0.6 percent in 2004, while IBM's overall sales jumped 8.3 percent to $96 billion(euro78.2 billion).But IBM's long-term microprocessing bet lies in a new breed of chips, code-namedCell, being developed with Sony and Toshiba Corp. Promising blazing speeds andthe ability to carry out 10 sets of computing instructions at once, Cell is dueto come out next year.Hopes for Cell are so high that Sony, which plans to use Cell chips in the nextgeneration of PlayStation game consoles, has invested $325 million (euro264.8million) in improvements to IBM's semiconductor plant in East Fishkill, NewYork.IBM's production of chips for Apple accounted for only about 2 percent ofFishkill's capacity.
Monday's announcement that Apple Computer Inc.will use Intel Corp. chips in its PCs made the Mac faithful think:different.After weeks of rumors and speculation, Apple Chief Executive SteveJobs told software engineers at the company's annual developerconference that Intel microprocessors would power Macintosh computersbeginning next year, with Intel inside all Apple computers by 2007.The move ends a long and sometimes-stormy relationship betweenApple and IBM Corp., which builds the Mac's current PowerPC chips, andMotorola Inc., which makes chips for Apple laptops. Intel suppliesmost of the chips that power PCs running the Windows operating systemof Apple archrival Microsoft Corp. So closely aligned are Microsoftand Intel that they often are referred to as Wintel.So to some of Apple's Macolytes, the new alliance portendedsomething sinister for the Cupertino-based company that has leveragedthe success of its iPod portable music players to boost sales of itsstylish but pricey PCs.``Where does this lead us?'' Jobs asked from the stage. Before Jobscould answer himself, someone in the audience cracked: ``Down the roadto hell.''Despite sentiments like that, computer industry analysts and manyMac users discounted the long-term effects of the change, saying Applehas built its reputation on software and design rather than the rawcomputing power of its machines. By switching to Intel, they said,Apple may be able to cut prices on its computers and compete moredirectly against low-cost sellers such as Dell Inc.In wooing Apple, Santa Clara-based Intel can claim the prestige ofsupplying one of Silicon Valley's most finicky customers, but thefinancial benefits will be relatively small. Intel is the world'slargest chip maker and Apple is one of the smallest major PC makers,with just under 4 percent of the market.For its part, Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM has already focused itsenergies on building chips for the fast-growing video game industry.Its chip technology will power next-generation game consoles from allthree of the major game companies -- Microsoft, Sony Corp. andNintendo Co.On a generally flat day on the financial markets, Apple shares fell32 cents to $37.92, Intel dropped 16 cents to $27.17 and IBM lost 79cents to $75.Jobs described the switch to Intel as the third major transitionfor Mac computers since the company was formed in 1976. The other twowere the initial switch to PowerPC chips between 1994 and 1996 and themove to a new operating system, OS X, between 2001 and 2003.The change was fueled by a desire ``to make the best computersgoing forward,'' Jobs said, noting that he promised high-performancedesktop and laptop models two years ago that never materialized. ``Weenvision amazing products we want to build for you. But we don't knowhow to do it on the future of PowerPC.''He did not cite IBM by name, but Apple reportedly had beenfrustrated by IBM's inability to develop a chip that could processimmense amounts of data without overheating. Intel, by contrast, toutsits cool-running chips that consume less power.But just because the chips are the same, differences will stillexist between Macs and other PCs. Most noticeably, Apple will continueto promote the virtues of its operating system, which is widely viewedas more stable and secure than Windows even if it runs a fraction ofthe programs.``This is not a clone play,'' said Jupiter Research consultantMichael Gartenberg. ``OS X won't run on a Dell or HP machine. Willsomeone come up with a hack to do so? Absolutely. But the OS Xinstaller will not allow it to work on a non-Apple machine that's notfrom Cupertino. But I can imagine Microsoft creating an app where youpush a button and get OS X, and push a button and get Windows.''
Steven P. Jobs is preparing to take anunprecedented gamble by abandoning Apple Computer's 14-year commitment to chipsdeveloped by IBM and Motorola in favor of Intel processorsfor his Macintosh computers, industry executives informed of the decisionsaid Sunday.The move is a chesslike gambit in a broader industry turfwar that pits the traditional personal computer industry against anemerging world of consumer electronics focused on the digital home.""This is a seismic shift in the world of personal computingand consumer electronics,"" said Richard Doherty, president of the EnvisioneeringGroup, a Seaford, N.Y., computer and consumer electronics industry consultingfirm. ""It is bound to rock the industry, but itwill also be a phenomenal engineering challenge for Apple.""Jobs is expected to announce the transition to Intel chips atApple's annual developer conference, which will begin here Monday. Apple'sintention to shift to Intel chips beginning in 2006 wasreported Friday by CNET News.com, a technology news service. TheWall Street Journal had previously reported that Apple and IBMwere negotiating.Apple, according to analysts, has become increasingly alarmed by IBM's failureto deliver a new version of its Power PC chip,called the G5, that does not generate much heat --a crucial feature for notebook computers, which do not haveas much room for fans and ventilation as desktop machines.Apple's notebooks now use the older G4 chips, made by FreescaleSemiconductor, which was spun off from Motorola last year.""That's a huge looming problem for Apple, if it can't keepup with Intel notebooks in performance,"" said Charles Wolf, ananalyst for Needham & Co. ""And that's been an IBMproblem. IBM hasn't delivered a cool-running G5.""Jobs is scheduled to take the stage Monday to face hissoftware developers, an important constituency he must convince of thewisdom of the shift. It is the software developers whowill need to do the hard work of making theirprograms run on Intel chips if Jobs' strategy is tosucceed.Apple must be able to persuade software developers who make businessand graphics programs for the Macintosh -- Microsoft, Adobe, Quarkand others -- to overhaul their code.""That's a huge challenge for Apple, to win the software developersover and drag them along,"" said Wolf, the Needham analyst.
Apple Computer Inc. Monday dumped IBM Corp. as the supplier ofprocessor chips for its Macintosh computers. Starting next year, futureMacs will use Intel Corp. processors, the same kinds ofchips found in millions of PCs running software from Apple'sarchrival Microsoft Corp.Apple plans to have its first Intel-based computers available a yearfrom now, and its entire line of desktop and notebookcomputers are to feature Intel chips by 2007.The company did not say which Intel chips would be usedin its products, but Intel spokesman Charles Mulloy said theywould be standard Intel processors, just like the Pentium 4processors found in PCs running Microsoft's Windows operating system.The deal, revealed at Apple's annual San Francisco conference for softwaredevelopers, had been widely rumored in recent weeks. The originalMac, released in 1984, used a processor made by MotorolaInc. A decade ago, Apple switched to PowerPC, a chipdesigned by Motorola and IBM.By PC industry standards, the deal is small potatoes. Apple sold3.8 million Mac computers over the past four quarters, givingit less than 3 percent of the worldwide desktop computermarket.But Roger Kay, vice president for client computing at IDC Corp.in Framingham, said Intel will derive big benefits thanks toApple's reputation. ""It's not just 2 percent of the marketshare, it's also a very prestigious company,"" Kay said.Apple's iPod music players and iTunes Internet music retail store havemade the company one of America's most respected electronics firms,and Kay said that some of that cachet could ruboff on Intel.IBM has endured major technical difficulties in producing sufficient quantities ofthe PowerPC G5, the chip used in today's Macs, andApple has publicly criticized IBM for problems which forced Appleto delay the release of faster Macs. IBM also failedto deliver a low-power version of the G5 suitable foruse in laptop computers.Stephen Baker, director of industry analysis at the NPD Group inPort Washington, N.Y., said Apple's inability to put its mostpowerful chip in a laptop was a major problem, ata time when laptop sales are on the upswing.""I think Apple looked out and said, what are we goingto do here? We're really losing ground,"" Baker said. Intelmakes the Pentium M, a cool-running chip designed especially forlaptops. Baker predicted the first Apple machines with Intel processorswould probably be laptops, and perhaps the low-end Mac Minihome machine.Apple has not said how long it will continue to providetechnical support for owners of Macs based on IBM chips,but the company may have to give strong pledges ofsupport, or sharp discounts, to sell its remaining stock ofIBM-based machines.The NPD Group's Baker warned that as the release date ofthe new Intel Macs draws near, many people will delaytheir purchases until the new machines go on sale. ""It'swhen you get into that last three months or soand everybody knows it's coming,"" Baker said. ""That's when it'sgoing to be very difficult for them to get peopleinto the stores.""Hiawatha Bray can be reached at brayglobe.com.
Apple Computer Inc. began a historic transition Monday:The Cupertino, Calif., firm plans to switch to Intel Corp.microprocessors for its Macintosh lineup starting next year.Ending weeks of speculation, Apple Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs confirmedplans to dump its current lineup of PowerPC chips, whichApple has long touted as superior to Intel chips. Jobssaid the two firms that have supplied Apple with microprocessorsfor years, IBM and the Motorola spin-off Freescale, can nolonger supply the kinds of chips that Apple needs forfuture products.Jobs warmly embraced Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini onstage beforehundreds of attendees at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, ina gesture that symbolized the new partnership between the twoiconic Silicon Valley companies.""We're so happy the world's most innovative computer company and theworld's most innovative chip company have finally teamed up,"" Otellinitold the crowd at San Francisco's Moscone Center West. ""Ithink this brings together the skills and the engineering excellenceof two great companies.""Apple plans to make the transition over a 21/2-year period. SomeMacs with Intel inside are scheduled to be released inJune 2006, with most of the lineup to be convertedby June 2007. Jobs said he hopes the full switchwill be completed by the end of 2007.Although there has been much speculation through the years about sucha partnership, few realized how long the two firms havebeen working on this.In his speech, Jobs revealed that a team of Apple engineershas been secretly working on a transition from IBM's PowerPCplatform to an Intel-based architecture for five years inside abuilding on the firm's Cupertino campus.In fact, every edition of Macintosh OS X that has beenreleased since then has been been designed to also runon the Intel platform ""just in case,"" Jobs said.""The Mac OS has been leading a secret double life forthe past five years,"" Jobs said. ""So Mac OS Xis cross-platform by design right from the very beginning.""A few developers in the audience groaned when Jobs confirmed theswitch, but later cheered when Jobs demonstrated a Macintosh desktopthat was already operating on an Intel Pentium 4 3.6GHz processor.Jobs said Apple decided to start the transition now because Intel'smicroprocessor development road map promises features, like more efficient powerconsumption, that Apple did not foresee in similar plans forthe PowerPC chip.Apple had great products planned, but ""we don't know how tobuild them with the current PowerPC program,"" Jobs said.Apple's move marks a significant but risky combination between two ofSilicon Valley's largest, most visible players.""Every time they've tried to make this kind of transition, they'vemanaged to lose market share,"" said Nathan Brookwood, an analystat market research firm Insight 64. ""And they don't havethat much market share to lose.""Shaw Wu, an analyst with American Technology Research of San Francisco,said the Apple-Intel alliance also presents a marketing problem, becauseApple has spent more than 10 years touting the superiorityof its PowerPC chips over Intel's Pentium. Apple ""could riskalienating some of its loyal customer base,"" Wu said ina report.""It's a gamble,"" said Kevin Krewell, an analyst at In-Stat/MDR, notingthat a transition to a new chip is never easy.""But if anyone can make this transition, it's Apple. They'vedone more transitions than anyone else.""The news Monday didn't make waves on Wall Street. Apple closedat $37.92, down 32 cents per share in Nasdaq trading.Intel shares were down 62 cents, closing at $19.79.The agreement has major symbolic value, bridging the gap between twofirms that have been on ideologically opposite sides of thetech world for 25 years.Apple has been using Motorola chips since the early 1980s, whenthe firm essentially inaugurated the personal computing era. In 1991,Motorola and IBM began collaborating on the PowerPC, which thenbecame the central brain for Apple's Macintosh computers.Although Apple had an early lead in the field, it wassoon overtaken by a powerful partnership that relegated Apple toa niche technology player. Ironically, that partnership was keyed byIntel, which paired with Microsoft Corp. to create the ""Wintel""platform, which dominates desktop computing today.Apple's switch comes as IBM, which made G5 processors used inMacintosh desktops, has also begun to focus on new partners.A statement IBM released after Jobs' keynote speech did notreact directly to Apple's impending chip switch. Instead, IBM highlightedits own recent inroads in the video game industry.""IBM is aggressively moving the Power Architecture beyond the PC, asshown by our recent successes with the next-generation gaming systemsannounced by Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo,"" the statement said. ""IBMis focused on the highest-value opportunities in each marketplace, andour direction with the Power Architecture is consistent with thatstrategy.""Meanwhile, Freescale Semiconductor Inc., the Austin, Texas, company that spun offfrom Motorola in 2004 and makes the G4 chips usedin Apple laptops, also tried to downplay the loss ofApple.""Apple represents only 3 percent of total Freescale revenues,"" said amemo from Freescale Chairman and CEO Michel Mayer to employees,which the company released publicly. ""It was becoming more andmore difficult to justify that level of investment to providethe customized products Apple required to satisfy a small partof the market.""In the past year or so, some frustration in Cupertino withIBM was apparent. About a year ago, Apple publicly blamedIBM for its short supply of PowerPC chips for thePower Mac G5 desktop computers.Apple later said it had to delay the release of itsnew iMac computers because IBM couldn't meet Apple's demand forsimilar chips.Another challenge Apple has been facing with IBM is delivering processorsthat consume less power and create less heat. One ofthe biggest questions for Apple has been whether the computer-makerwill be able to upgrade its lineup of laptop computersfrom PowerPC G4 chips to PowerPC G5 chips, which AppleExecutive Vice President Tim Cook has called ""the mother ofall thermal challenges.""On Monday, Jobs said a key factor in the switch wasIntel's plans for chips with a performance-to- power-ratio more thanfour times greater than any PowerPC chip in the works.The move to an Intel platform could provide quite a fewheadaches for software developers, who now have to retool theirproducts, although Jobs said Apple engineers already have codes toease the transition.Apple announced the availability of a $999 Developer Transition Kit, consistingof an Intel-based Mac development system along with preview versionsof Apple's own software for the Intel chips.
Apple announced on Monday plansto deliver models of its Macintosh computers using Intel microprocessors in 2006 and to convert all of its Macs to use Intel microprocessors by the end of 2007.Apple previewed a version of its operating system, Mac OS X Tiger, running on an Intel-based Mac to the over 3,800 developers attending its Worldwide Developer Conference in San Francisco.Apple's computers are now installed with PowerPC microprocessors from IBM, which are different in design from the popular X-86 chips of Intel and AMD.""It's been 10 years since our transition to the PowerPC, and wethink Intel's technology will help us create the best personal computers for the next 10 years,"" said Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO.Apple announced the availability of a Developer Transition Kit,consisting of an Intel-based Mac development system along with preview versions of Apple's software, which will allow developers to prepare versions of their applications which will run on both PowerPC and Intel-based Macs.Paul Otellini, president and CEO of Intel, hailed Apple's decision to adopt Intel chips, saying his company is ""thrilled to have the world's most innovative personal computer company as a customer.""
","In June 2005, Steve Jobs announced that Apple would switch to Intel chips for some of its Macintosh computers in 2006, all by 2007. IBM, its supplier for 14 years, was unable to deliver its new PC chip that promised more power and less heat, both needed for laptops Apple planned. The move was a gamble for Apple because software developers would have to re-engineer all programs for Intel chips. Intel celebrated the deal, although Macintosh held only 2% of the market. IBM was not badly hurt; it had long planned to concentrate on chips for computer games. ","Steve Jobs is preparing to abandon Apple Computer's 14-year commitment to chips developed by IBM and Motorola in favor of Intel processors. Apple has been frustrated by IBMs failure to deliver a G5 chip that does not generate much heat. After weeks of rumors, Jobs announced that the switch would be made by 2007. Apple must now persuade software developers to make their programs run on Intel chips. Apple's operating system is viewed as more stable and secure than Windows. Intel's CEO said his company is thrilled to have the world's most innovative personal computer company as a customer. ","Steve Jobs told software engineers at Apple's annual developer conference in San Francisco that Apple will discontinue using IBM and Motorola chips in favor of Intel microprocessors. Apple engineers have secretly worked on a transition for five years. Every edition of Macintosh OS X since then has been designed to run on both IBM and Intel chips. Apple is producing Developer Transition Kits that will allow software developers to prepare applications to run on both chips. Apple's lower-end computers, like the Mac Mini, will get Intel chips in June 2006. Apple's entire computer line will have them by December 2007. ","On 6 June Apple Computer announced plans to abandon its 14-year ties with IBM and Motorola in favor of Intel processors. Apple had been frustrated by IBM's inability to develop a chip that could process large amounts of data without overheating. Apple programs will have to be rewritten to run on an Intel-powered Mac, although engineers have already developed codes to ease the transition. Apple could lose sales in the short term, as people wait for the switch. The first Intel-powered Macs are scheduled for June 2006; all Macs should be converted by the end of 2007. "
D0925,D0925-B,"After touting its Macintosh computers as superior alternatives for more than 20years, Apple Computer Inc. said Monday that it plans to switch to the very Intelmicroprocessors that power machines designed to run MicrosoftWindows.The long-rumored move is expected to help Apple compete better against WindowsPCs in performance and _ potentially _ price, though analysts believe theheadaches from the transition could further damage its slim 2.3 percentworldwide market share.Apple, which will continue to tightly couple its computers and its software, nowmust convince users and potential buyers that today's Macs will not become thetechnology equivalent of lame ducks. And it must get programmers to developsoftware that works on both versions.In a speech to software developers Monday, Apple CEO Steve Jobs admitted thechange will not be fast or easy. The first Intel-based Macs won't appear until2006, and the full product line won't shift to Intel until the following year,he said.""This is not going to be a transition that happens overnight,"" Jobs said. ""It'sgoing to happen over a period of a few years.""He said the move was driven by the fact that its current chip suppliers _ IBMCorp. and Freescale Semiconductor Inc. _ could not promise the same horsepowerand power efficiency as Intel, the world's largest semiconductorcompany.Programmers can immediately start developing software in a format that will runnatively on both existing and future Mac chips, he said. Apple also will have atechnology in place that will translate the code so that older programs will runon the Macs with Intel inside.Jobs revealed that Apple has been working on the move for at least five years,creating two versions of its Mac OS X operating system for both the current Macchips and those built by Intel.""Mac OS X has been leading a secret double life,"" he said.The news was greeted by a mix of cheers and laughs at the conference anduncertainty among Mac fans who believe a switch to Intel chips is like joiningforces with the dark side.Wall Street had mixed feelings, too. Shares of Apple closed at $37.92, down 32cents, in Monday trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Intel shares lost 16 centsto close at $27.17.Calming fears that Apple's switch would ignite a revolt among its most importantsoftware programmers, Jobs was joined on stage by two major developers _ AdobeSystems Inc. and Microsoft. Both announced that they would support Macs runningthe existing and new hardware.Apple also quickly snuffed out the possibility that computer makers other thanitself might someday offer Mac OS X. But it did not say how it would preventusers from installing a pirated copy of the software on their computers fromDell Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co. or others.It's also not clear whether the move might make Macs more vulnerable to attacksby viruses and other malware. To date, they've been mostly exempt.In making the move, Apple is abandoning a processor known as the PowerPC that itdeveloped with International Business Machines Corp. and Motorola Inc. in the1990s to compete against Intel's x86 architecture and which it touted as morepowerful.On Monday, neither Apple nor Intel would specify the exact chips that will beused. Jobs did say that Intel's focus on power management, crucial to extendingbattery life on portable computers, was as important as performance in thedecision.The switch ends years of squabbling between Apple and its chip suppliers, IBMand Freescale Semiconductor Inc., which was spun off from Motorola lastyear.When Motorola was the supplier of G4 chips for Macs, Apple grew frustrated withthe rate of improvement. In 2002, it signed a deal with IBM to provide advancedchips for its high-end desktop computers, the Power Mac G5.But the IBM-Apple deal was rocky almost from the start.Jobs said Macs would top 3 gigahertz in processing speed by last summer, but IBMdid not deliver. The IBM chips also were scarce for desktop computers andnonexistent for notebooks, which by some measures have now begun to outsell PCsin the United States.They simply ran too hot and consumed too much electricity forportables.Though the Mac could benefit from Intel's chips, skeptical analysts questionedwhether it was worth the risk. In the past, major transitions have led todefections by customers and software developers, said Nathan Brookwood, ananalyst at the research firm Insight 64.In the mid-1980s, the Mac captured as much as 10 percent of the overall PCmarket, he said. But when Apple switched from Motorola 68000 processors toPowerPC chips, the Mac's share dropped to below 5 percent. When the Mac'soperating system later changed to OS X, it fell to below 3 percent.""I have a lot of trouble understanding why they would do it,"" Brookwood said ofthe transition to Intel processors. ""Unless there's something magical, I wouldhave to believe it's not a good move.""By wrestling away Apple's business from IBM, Intel gains further dominance ofthe PC processor business. It currently has 80 percent marketshare.Paul Otellini, Intel's new chief executive, said the chip maker was pleased tohave Apple as a customer.""I suspect there is a whole bunch of you that never thought you would see thislogo on this stage,"" he said onstage with Jobs. ""I was one of them for awhile.""Although IBM and Freescale suffer a setback with the loss of Apple, Mac chipsales were just a fraction of their total semiconductor revenues. Both said itallows them to focus on more promising, non-PC businesses.Recently, IBM has signed deals to provide the chips for the next-generationvideo game machines of Microsoft, Nintendo Co. and Sony Corp.A new microprocessor that IBM co-developed with Sony and Toshiba Corp.,code-named Cell and planned for Sony's next PlayStation console, is being toutedas capable of delivering 10 times the performance of today's PCprocessors.___AP Technology Writer Greg Sandoval reported from San Francisco, and MatthewFordahl reported from Salinas, Calif.
In the late 1990s, Apple Computer Inc. ran TV ads mocking the Intel Corp. chipsin rival Windows-based PCs: The Pentium II glued to a snail and the toastedbunny suit were supposed to suggest that Apple's Macintosh computers were simplyfaster.How times have changed. Apple CEO Steve Jobs warmly embraced Intel ChiefExecutive Paul Otellini this week as they announced that Macs will switch tochips built by the same company that has made a fortune selling the hardwarethat powers PCs running Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system.Though the transition is likely to be rocky at first for Apple, programmers andcustomers, the move could lead to Macs that are both more competitive and morecompatible with Windows. It could even open the Mac to software titles nowavailable only to Windows users.At the same time, Apple would retain as much control as it wants over itssoftware and brand.Beyond the future performance and energy efficiency improvements Intel haspromised, Apple could deploy an Intel security scheme that could allow Apple tokeep its operating system locked to Macs. Apple also could tap a separate Inteltechnology that lets multiple operating systems run efficiently on a singlechip.Such advances could be critical for Apple, which has gained a reputation forbuilding innovative and stylish machines that run Apple's own, acclaimed Mac OSX operating system. By not allowing clones, as are common in the Windows world,Apple can still charge a premium and differentiate itself.After all, the microprocessor may be the brain of a computer, but the soul isprovided by the software, which Apple has said will continue to be locked to itssystems.Apple's business model of selling its own computers and operating system stemsfrom 1970s, when Jobs and friend Steve Wozniak were pioneering the personalcomputer industry from a Silicon Valley garage. At the time, a fledgling companythen-called Micro-Soft was just getting started.That changed in the early 1980s, when International Business Machines Corp.rushed to put out a personal computer that could compete against Apple. Big Blueintegrated hardware and software from other companies _ namely, Intel andMicrosoft _ into its systems.IBM famously failed to stop competitors from copying its PC. A healthy IBM cloneindustry grew, fueled by the support of software developers, who saw the hugebusiness opportunity in the volume of clone PCs being purchased.Apple continued to sell systems based on non-Intel processors and its ownsoftware. Even in 1984, when it launched the first Mac, it stuck with Motorolachips and its own software.In the 1990s, Motorola and Apple joined forces with IBM, which by then longrealized it had lost control of the PC, to build the more powerful PowerPCmicroprocessor to do battle with WinTel.But Apple's market share continued to slide. Corporations and consumers embracedWindows-based systems because they could run more programs. Software developersloved WinTel because it guaranteed a huge market.Apple became the niche player it is today, with just 2.3 percent of theworldwide market, according to the latest figures from the research firmIDC.Still, Jobs managed to continue marketing the Mac as the Porsche of the PCindustry.But IBM and Motorola, which last year spun off its chip business into FreescaleSemiconductor Inc., haven't been able to give Apple what it needs. Freescale'sG4 has seen only incremental improvements in performance while IBM's G5 runs toohot for notebook computers.And so Jobs went chip hunting.Intel promises Apple fast, energy-efficient chips, manufacturing reliability andpossibly even lower prices.Apple could lose control of its operating system when it starts using next yearthe same hardware that powers the Windows world.That's where the new technologies come into play and why Apple is so willing tomake a move.Intel has been touting a hardware-based security plan called LaGrande Technologyas a way to keep systems secure by locking data with a key that's embedded in ahardware chip.But LaGrande also could be used to ensure that certain software only runs onpermitted machines, such as Mac OS X only running on systems built byApple.""You can tie the serial number of the software with the hardware ID, and saythese things go together and shall never be separate,"" said Roger Kay, ananalyst at IDC.But there's a much bigger opportunity for Apple beyond faster, more efficientchips. Though it will prevent Mac OS X from leaking non-Apple PCs, it couldallow Apple systems to run Windows _ and its universe of programs _ at fullspeed. Currently, running Windows programs on Macs requires emulators that slowdown performance.""It seems to me that Jobs is putting himself in the sights of Bill Gates,"" saidDon Yachtman, a Salt Lake City-based software developer. ""Microsoft may act likethey don't care about Apple's move to Intel but you never know until they launchan attack.""But Microsoft isn't likely to complain. After all, Apple or its customers wouldstill have to buy a copy of Windows.Nonetheless, Apple faces technical and psychological hurdles in the nearterm.""I'm sure some of Apple's loyal customer base see this as a sellout,"" said TimDeal, senior analyst with Technology Business Research. ""These users supportedthis niche, boutique player for years and this agreement with Intel removes avery important difference between a Mac and a PC.""
Apple Computer Inc.'s historic shift to Intel Corp. microprocessors came earlierthan expected Tuesday as CEO Steve Jobs unveiled an updated iMac computer basedon the world's largest semiconductor company's new two-brainedchip.The switch to Intel was first announced in June, when Apple said it expected tobegin making the transition by the middle of 2006.But on Tuesday, Apple CEO Steve Jobs was joined onstage by Intel CEO PaulOtellini, who was wearing a bunny suit, to make the announcement.""With (the) Mac OS X (operating system) plus Intel's latest dual-core processorunder the hood, the new iMac delivers performance that will knock our customers'socks off,"" said Jobs.For years, Apple shunned Intel, which has provided chips that power a majorityof the world's PCs, along with Windows software from Microsoft Corp. In the late1990s, Apple even ran TV ads with a Pentium II glued to a snail.But Apple, looking for faster, more energy-efficient chips, became increasinglyfrustrated in recent years as its chip suppliers, IBM Corp. and Motorola Corp.'sspinoff, Freescale Semiconductor Inc., failed to meet its needs.Of particular concern was IBM's apparent inability to develop a G5 chip thatwould work well in notebook computers.Intel, on the other hand, has been focusing on developing chips specificallytailored for notebooks. In 2003, it launched its Centrino notebook technologywith a processor that boosted a longer battery life by minimizing its powerdemand without a major hit to performance.During last week's International Consumer Electronics Show, Intel unveiled thelatest generation, the Core Duo, which features two computing engines on asingle piece of silicon.It was that chip the Apple decided to fit into the new iMac.The Core Duo chip's low energy requirements are expected to enable ever-smallercomputers, including some built right into television sets as the industry gearsits machines more toward multimedia use.
Apple Computer Inc.'s new Intel-based computers took center stage at CEO SteveJobs' speech at the Macworld Expo on Tuesday but he also unveiled changes to thecompany's software and iPod accessory lineup:_ The iMac with Intel's Core Duo processor: The machines are up to two timesfaster than older iMacs running the G5 chip. They've got a built-in camera forWeb conferencing and a remote control to access music, videos and photos fromacross a room. Priced at $1,299 with a 17-inch (43-centimeter) display and a1.83-gigahertz processor and $1,699 with a 20-inch (50-centimeter) monitor and2.0 GHz processor.

Intel Corp., the largest chip maker, on Thursdayincreased its revenue forecast for the second quarter because ofstrong sales of notebook computers that use its Centrino chip.The company said revenue would be in the range of $9.1billion to $9.3 billion, higher than the range of $8.6billion to $9.2 billion it gave in April. The quarterends July 2.The revised estimates beat the estimates of Wall Street analysts, whowere expecting sales of about $8.99 billion, according to ThomsonFinancial.Intel does not provide earnings guidance, but analysts have forecast aprofit of 28 cents a share for the second quarter.The company posted earnings of 27 cents a share inthe second quarter last year.Before Intel released its update, shares in the company rose 60cents on Thursday, to close at $27.70, then fell slightlyin after-hours trading.Intel's revised forecast capped a week of good news for thesemiconductor sector. On Wednesday, the Semiconductor Industry Association estimated thatworldwide chip sales would increase 6 percent in 2005, to$226 billion, revising its earlier forecast that pegged 2005 salesas flat with 2004, saying that high energy prices havenot dampened electronics sales as the industry had feared.And earlier in the week, Texas Instruments raised its financial targetsto the high end of its projected range, citing strongdemand, while National Semiconductor reported better-than-expected earnings.On Monday Intel announced a deal with Apple Computer to providethe chips that power Macintosh computers, replacing IBM's PowerPC chips,a crucial vote of confidence for the chip maker asit moves to put a period of technical setbacks andmissed deadlines behind it.Tim Luke, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, called Intel's revised forecastencouraging, particularly given recent changes at the company, including anew chief executive, the move to dual-core processing and anew manufacturing process known as 65 nanometer.""They are executing well on a series of transitions,"" said Luke,whose company has a buy rating on Intel stock.Intel expects gross margins to be approximately 57 percent, plus orminus a point, as compared with the earlier forecast of56 percent, plus or minus a couple of points. Intelalso said it expected to benefit from a tax rateof 26 percent compared with its earlier estimate of a31 percent rate. Intel's gains from equity investments and otheritems are expected to be approximately $100 million.
Nearly a quarter century ago, Apple Computer rana snarky ad after its onetime rival encroached on itsterritory: ""Welcome, IBM. Seriously."" This week, however, Steven P. Jobshad a different message for Big Blue, which had sincebecome a chief ally -- ""Goodbye. Seriously.""Jobs, 50, a co-founder of Apple, is famously brash and mercurial.Even so, the Apple faithful -- not to mention IBMitself -- were caught by surprise by Apple's decision toend its 14-year relationship with IBM and team with Intelfor its computer chip needs.The buzz that began Monday among developers, bloggers, analysts and Applefollowers trying to guess Jobs' true designs has not letup. After all, Jobs is a legend in no smallpart because he defied the monster combination that is Wintel-- as the digerati call the Windows and Intel alliance-- and lived to talk about it.Apple's decision in the 1980s to use a different chip thanthe one used by most personal computers ""fit in withthe idea of Think Different,"" Stephen G. Wozniak, who foundedApple with Jobs in 1976, said in an e-mail exchange.""So it's hard for some people to accept this switch.""So what could a Macintel possibly hope to accomplish?Potentially, quite a lot. In striking the deal, Jobs, Apple's chiefexecutive, has opened a range of tantalizing new options forhis quirky company.Many people in the industry believe that Jobs is racing quietlytoward a direct challenge to Microsoft and Sony in themarket for digital entertainment gear for the living room. Indeed,Sony's top executives had tried to persuade Jobs to adopta chip that IBM has been developing for the next-generationSony PlayStation.On paper, an Intel processor inside a Macintosh would put thevast library of Windows-based games and software programs within thereach of Mac users -- at least those who arewilling to run a second operating system on their computers.Moreover, having Intel Inside might solve an important perception problem thathas long plagued Apple in its effort to convert consumerswho are attracted to the company's industrial design, but whohave stayed away because the computers do not run Windowsprograms.There is an immediate risk in the tie-up with Intel, however:Jobs could soon find himself trapped if his best customersstop buying IBM-based Macintoshes while they wait for more powerfulIntel-based systems, which are likely to begin arriving in January2006.""There is going to be a long wait,"" said Mark D.Stahlman, a Wall Street analyst at Caris & Co. Thepower-conserving 64-bit Intel chips that Apple is counting on torejuvenate its laptop products will not be available until early2007, he pointed out.In an interview, Jobs rejected the notion that Apple might sufferfrom what is known as the ""Osborne Effect,"" a termthat describes the fate of the computer pioneer Adam Osbornewhose firm went bankrupt when he announced a successor tohis pioneering portable computer before it was available.At Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, Jobs talked of atransition that would appear almost seamless to customers. ""As welook ahead we can envision some amazing products we wantto build for you, and we don't know how tobuild them with the future Power PC roadmap,"" he said.Nothing was seamless about how the deal with Intel came together.Several executives close to the last-minute dealings between Apple and IBMsaid that Jobs waited until the last moment -- 3p.m. on Friday, June 4 -- to inform Big Blue.Those executives said that IBM had learned about Apple's negotiationswith Intel from media reports and that Apple had notreturned phone calls in recent weeks.The two camps dispute what led to the breakup. People closeto IBM said pricing was a central issue, while Jobsinsisted on stage Monday that IBM had failed to meetpromised performance measures.On stage, Jobs noted that he had promised both a 3-gigahertzMacintosh as well as a G5 Power PC, promises thathe had not been able to deliver.In the end, Jobs was given no choice but to movehis business to Intel when IBM executives said that withoutadditional Apple investment they were unwilling to pursue the fasterand lower-power chips he badly needs for his laptop business.""Technical issues were secondary to the business issues,"" said an executiveclose to the IBM side of the negotiations. Because thebusiness was not profitable, IBM ""decided not to continue togo ahead with the product road map.""But Jobs disputed this assessment, simply stating that IBM had failedto meet its technology roadmap. The issues in the end,he said, came down to speed and the absence ofa chip that consumed less electricity than traditional processors designedfor PCs.""As soon as I heard Steve say that the factor whereIntel's roadmap was superior was processing power per ((watt)) Iknew right away that it was exactly what I havebeen reading and saying and so have many others, thatthis is the real key to the future of highperformance computers,"" Wozniak wrote.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)As it happens, Intel's was not the only alternative chip designthat Apple had explored for the Mac. An executive closeto Sony said that last year Jobs had meetings inCalifornia with both Nobuyuki Idei, then the chairman and chiefexecutive of the Japanese consumer electronics firm, and with KenichiKutaragi, the creator of the Sony PlayStation.Kutaragi tried to interest Jobs in adopting the Cell microprocessor, whichis being developed by IBM for use in the comingPlayStation 3, in exchange for access to certain Sony technologies.Jobs rejected the idea, telling Kutaragi that he was disappointedwith the Cell design, which he believed would be evenless effective than the Power PC.Now that Jobs has broken with IBM, Apple is free topursue a potentially intriguing consumer electronics strategy with Intel.Intel hasbeen looking for ways to get its chips into devicesthat can compete with game consoles as living-room entertainment hubs.Indeed, all three next-generation video game machines made by Microsoft,Nintendo and Sony are based on IBM chips. And analyststhink that both Microsoft's Xbox 360 and the Sony PlayStation3, scheduled to arrive next spring, will be positioned ashome digital media hubs in addition to being video gamemachines -- and priced far lower than the Intel-powered, Windows-basedMedia Center PCs that are also aimed at the livingroom.Should the new consoles find wide acceptance as broad-based entertainment engines,Intel will need to respond -- and one attractive alternativewould be an inexpensive Macintosh Mini based on an Intelprocessor, capable of running the vast library of PC games.Before he can set his sights on that new market, Jobsfaces the task of shoring up his base, his customersand developers. On Monday, he made the case to thesoftware designers who must be willing to rewrite their softwarefor the new Macintel world.Early indications are that he made a convincing presentation.""The reason people buy Mac is the software, and I thinkthe real fun is yet to come,"" said Scott Love,the president of AquaMinds, a software concern in Palo Alto,Calif., that sells a Macintosh program called NoteTaker used bywriters, researchers and students. ""We'll be able to develop aprogram that will just work on both IBM and Intel-basedcomputers.""On the hardware side, Jobs' secret weapon will be his abilityto run Apple's manufacturing business efficiently while the company waitsfor its next hit product, whether it is an Intel-basedMini, or some new category of consumer product for theChristmas season.""One area where Steve is really good and manically focused ison supply chain issues,"" said Dan'l Lewin, who worked forJobs at both Apple and Next, and who is nowMicrosoft's top executive in Silicon Valley.Even more important will be his ability to persuade the Macintoshfaithful to join him in his journey from IBM toIntel. That is where Jobs has an advantage over virtuallyevery other business executive.""He is still committed to the idea of an Apple culture,""said Peter Schwartz, the co-founder and chairman of the GlobalBusiness Network, a consulting firm in Emeryville, Calif. ""It isthe counterculture to the dominant Windows culture.""
In just a few short years, Apple Computer Inc. and itsiPod portable media players changed the way consumers get musicand movies on the go.Is Apple now planning to do the same with entertainment insidethe home?When company co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs opens Apple's Macworld Conferencein San Francisco on Tuesday, industry analysts and others widelyexpect he'll announce new software and hardware designed to carryiPod's successes into the living room.New ultra-thin Apple laptops and possibly a new Mac Mini desktopcould easily link up with TVs to record and pauselive television programming, play video discs and music, and showoff digital photos and home movies, many Apple watchers predict.They'll likely run on Intel Corp. processors - a first forApple - and could include Intel's new Viiv (rhymes withfive) technology designed for home entertainment.Industry analysts also predict the company might release updates to itsentertainment-related software, including its year-old Front Row program for browsingmusic, video and pictures.Notoriously secretive Apple has said nothing publicly about what Jobs mightintroduce Tuesday.But a bigger push into home entertainment ""has to be somethingthey're looking at,"" said Steve Baker, vice president of technologyresearch company NPD Group.Why? Because even though Apple virtually created the current market forportable media players, it has less than 5 percent ofthe overall market for PCs and is barely a contenderin the nascent business of computers designed specifically for homeentertainment.Also, the convergence of portable and home entertainment is considered tobe the future of the digital lifestyle.Apple's main rivals - Microsoft Corp. and the manufacturers of Windows-basedcomputers - are pushing hard to dominate the digital livingroom with their ""media center"" PCs.Last week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Microsoftsaid sales of PCs running its Windows XP Media Centeroperating system rose by 300 percent last year. More than6.5 million of the entertainment-focused PCs have been sold since2002, according to Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates.Microsoft and its partners also showed off new media center softwareand hardware designed to improve the way consumers can movedigital content around between their TVs, portable devices and homePCs.""The media center PC numbers have been rising pretty steadily,"" saidRoger Kay, president of research firm Endpoint Technologies Associates Inc.""Consumers have shown they want the digital home.""Despite Microsoft's head start, Apple has some major assets in itscorner - namely its best-selling iPods, which now play videos,and its related iTunes online music and video store.Beginning this week, it also will likely have a new heavyweightpartner.Apple is widely expected to introduce its first computers containing processorsfrom Intel, which could dramatically widen the company's appeal beyondits niche of hard-core devotees.To mass-market computer users, the Intel logo would be a comfortingsignal that Apple machines will be compatible with other equipmentin their homes and in the tech world at large.Apple last year struck a potentially revolutionary deal to replace chipsfrom IBM Corp. and Austin, Texas-based Freescale Semiconductor Inc. withIntel chips in its computers beginning this year.In December, Apple and Intel also quietly helped launch a newtech industry consortium designed to create new standards to improvethe flow of content between TVs, computers and other devices.Kurt Scherf, principal analyst at Dallas-based research outfit Parks Associates, saidhe thinks Apple plans to introduce a revamped version ofits Mac Mini computer designed specifically as a home entertainmenthub. He also predicts Apple will announce new deals forcontent like its recent agreements with big TV networks suchas NBC, ABC and Disney for programming for its iPods.""They've definitely already set the precedent in content"" and portable devices,Scherf said. ""Now they've got to try to seriously addressthe living room with some sort of media server oftheir own.""The Mac Mini, small enough to be held in one handbut packed with enough power to handle home entertainment, seemslike the most likely candidate, Scherf said.Baker, the NPD analyst, predicted that any Apple push into homeentertainment would likely include all its computers, not just asingle one like the Mac Mini.And then, given Apple's propensity for surprise, others predict something completelydifferent.The Apple Core, an online Web site for Apple enthusiasts, speculatedthat the company may introduce new big-screen plasma TVs withMac computers built into them.Such new Apple TVs, the site predicted Monday, could download movies,organize home pictures and videos, and play music, all witha single remote control.Bob Keefe's e-mail address is bkeefecoxnews.com
Apple Computer Inc. Tuesday introduced the first computer in its Macintoshline to use a chip made by Intel Corp. Themove accelerates a shift by the maker of machines renownedfor their elegant design and ease of use to thesame brand of processor that runs the Windows software ofApple's archrival, Microsoft Corp.At the annual Macworld trade show in San Francisco, Apple chiefexecutive Steve Jobs introduced the first Intel-based Mac, a newmodel of the company's popular iMac line. ""With ... Intel'slatest dual-core processor under the hood, the new iMac deliversperformance that will knock our customers' socks off,"" said Jobs.The new machine also marks a new era for chip supplierIntel. The iMac is the first computer to use anew line of Intel chips called Core Duo. A successorto the Pentium M chip Intel designed for use inlaptop computers, the Core Duo is actually two processors inone. Each chip has two processing cores that enable itto handle many simultaneous tasks faster and more reliably thanstandard single-core chips.Apple has long relied on PowerPC chips made by IBM Corp,but IBM didn't introduce new and improved chip designs asquickly as Intel which, like its rival Advanced Micro DevicesInc., has been making dual-core Pentium chips since last year.And the PowerPC chips for Apple's line of iBook andPowerBook laptop computers lagged behind Intel's and AMD's laptop chips.Cost was also a problem, according to industry analyst Roger Kay,the president of Endpoint Technologies Associates Inc. in Wayland. BecauseIntel produces a huge volume of processor chips for companiesaround the world, it can offer chips at lower pricesthan IBM. ""The benefit that the user gets is thelower cost that comes from the volume production that Intelcan bring,"" Kay said.Apple disclosed last year that it would switch over its entireproduct line to Intel processors. The company has modified itsMac OS X operating system to run on the Intelchips, which are exactly the same as those used byWindows-based PCs. However, the Intel-based Macs won't be able torun Windows software.The transition to Intel wasn't supposed to begin until the spring,but Jobs said that the Intel-based iMac, priced at $1,299,is available now at Apple retailers. He also revealed anew Intel-based laptop Mac, priced at $1,999, set to goon sale next month.At Tuesday's event, Jobs also unveiled upgrades to Apple's iLife lifestylesoftware and iWork productivity software, and the Radio Remote, aheadphone that transforms the company's iPod music player into anFM radio.The iPod's explosive success was reflected in Apple's financial results. Jobssaid Apple sold 14 million iPods in its first quarterof fiscal 2006, which ended in December. This helped togenerate quarterly revenues of $5.7 billion, a billion dollars morethan Apple had predicted last October. Apple's results were alsoboosted by stronger sales of Mac computers. Apple sold 1.25million of the machines in the first quarter.The popularity of the iPod has made Apple a major forcein consumer electronics. The company's iTunes Music Store is theleading distributor of recorded music on the Internet, and hasbegun selling downloadable TV programs for viewing on its videoiPod.Some industry analysts had expected the company to unveil new productsfor the home entertainment market Tuesday. Rival Microsoft launched amajor push of its own at last week's International ConsumerElectronics show in Las Vegas. Microsoft showed off a newoperating system and an array of products for managing musicand movies.Jim Pelham, an analyst at Strategy Analytics Inc., a Boston communicationsand entertainment technology consultany, said he has long expected Appleto introduce other products to build on the iPod's success.But he understands why the company isn't venturing too faroff the beaten path.""I don't think they're really in the position that Microsoft is,to spread their bets across several niches,"" said Pelham. Despiteits success in music, Apple remains a niche computer companywith a loyal but relatively small following, Pelham said.Apple's stock surged $4.81 to close at $80.86, while Intel's stockdeclined 35 cents to $26.12, both on the Nasdaq stockexchange.Hiawatha Bray can be reached at brayglobe.com.

Leaping six months ahead of schedule, Apple Computeron Tuesday showed off two new computers powered by Intelmicroprocessors, giving the company new leverage in winning over PCcustomers.In a 90-minute address at the Macworld trade show here, AppleChairman Steve Jobs unveiled a new iMac desktop computer poweredby an Intel dual-core processor that he said runs morethan twice as fast as current models but costs thesame.The news was received with typical enthusiasm by hundreds of Macdevotees on opening day of the four-day show.The new iMac went on sale Tuesday at $1,300 and $1,700,depending on screen size and other features.Jobs also showed off a new line of Intel-powered laptop computerscalled MacBook Pro, which he said are four to fivetimes faster than the PowerBook models they replace. Priced at$2,000 and $2,500, the MacBooks will begin shipping in February.The announcements impressed both analysts and investors, who bid Apple stockup $4.81 a share to $80.66 on the Nasdaq. Intelshares fell 35 cents to close at $26.12.It also surprised some Apple watchers who had anticipated new additionsto the company's wildly successful line of iPods.By shifting to Intel from its longtime use of PowerPC chipsbuilt by Motorola and IBM, Apple gets a significant boostin performance and, even more importantly, experts say, a comfortlevel with current users of Windows PCs.""Now, when you buy a Mac, it will say ""'Intel Inside.'That will be a comforting factor,"" said Jim Dalrymple, newsdirector for Macworld magazine.""The move to Intel is critical to Apple's future because itallows (the company) to attract the hard-core PC crowd,"" addedanalyst Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies. ""If they showthey can run applications two or three or four timesfaster, they will get a lot of attention.""The Intel introductions come on the heels of a dazzling 2005when 32 million iPods sold, 14 million of them inthe fourth quarter alone. In 2004, the company sold just8.3 million of the devices.Apple's sales from October through December hit a record $5.7 billion,compared with $3.49 billion in the same quarter a yearearlier.By focusing on its new Intel-based products, Apple is appealing toits power users and laying groundwork for expanding its sharebeyond the estimated 4 percent of the personal computer marketthat it now holds.Experts called the accelerated Intel introduction a big advantage for Apple,which had previously predicted that Intel-powered Macs wouldn't be availableuntil midyear. Getting to market early gives power-hungry Mac usersa reason to buy a new machine and software makersnew incentives to develop programs that run on the newplatform.""This is an amazing effort, given the short amount of timethey had to work on it,"" said Michael Gartenberg, ananalyst with Jupiter Research.While only one Intel-powered Mac is available right now, Jobs saidthe entire line of Macs will shift to Intel bythe end of 2006. Software developers also are racing towrite programs that will run on both the Intel andolder PowerPC.The Intel announcement was accompanied by an appearance by Intel ChairmanPaul Otellini, who walked on stage wearing a white ""bunnysuit"" used in chip manufacturing. ""Steve, I want to reportthat Intel is ready to go,"" he said.For years Apple shunned Intel products -- and even mocked themin its television ads. But last June it announced itwould use Intel chips, partly motivated by an inability toget its G5 microprocessors to run effectively in its PowerBooklaptop computers.Intel's dual-core chips are a much better fit for the laptopplatform, analysts say. Preceding Tuesday's unveiling, Apple also showed offimprovements to its suite of iLife software, which includes photo,video and music editing capabilities.New to the $79 lineup is software that lets users moreeasily produce podcasts and create their own Web sites.""This takes emerging consumer activities, such as blogging and podcasting, andmakes them drop-dead simple and attractive,"" said Van Baker, ananalyst with Gartner. He called the new Apple products ""ahome run.""While Apple surprised observers with its quick conversion to the Intelplatform, it also defied speculation that it would introduce anew iPod and perhaps unveil a new Macintosh designed tobe a command center for other consumer electronics in thehome, such as stereos and televisions.But analyst Bajarin said Apple is likely to introduce new iPodslater this year, and media center Macs might not beon the near horizon, even though companies such as MicrosoftCorp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. are pushing hard to market suchproducts.""I don't think we'll see that from Apple in the shortterm,"" he said. ""Apple has a tendency to let othercompanies get the arrows in their backs, then Apple comesin and does it better.""
Apple Computer Inc. on Tuesdayunveiled its first Mac computers based on Intel processors, marking a big shift of the computer maker.Addressing a packed crowd of the Apple faithful in the annual Macworld show in San Francisco, chief executive Steve Jobs released the long-awaited new products: the desktop and laptop machines using Intel's dual core chips.The iMac will come in the same sizes and sell for the same prices as the current models, but the Intel chips make it two to three times faster, Jobs said.A 1.83-gigahertz version of the iMac with a 17-inch screen sells for 1,299 U.S. dollars.A new laptop computer, called the MacBook Pro, will be available in February. The machine, four to five times faster thancurrent PowerBook laptops, will also include a built-in camera forvideo conference, he said.""The MacBook Pro is the fastest Mac notebook ever, obviously,"" Jobs said.Apple had used the PowerPC processors made by IBM and Motorola in its Macintosh computers for more than two decades. But the company planned a shift to Intel last year, after the PowerPC processor was criticized as being slower.With the first personal computer Apple II, Apple had pioneered the information technology during the 1980s. Now Apple computers' market share is shrinking under competition from cheap producers such as Dell, but the company still has a group of loyal fans.
","Apple rolled out its new Intel-based Mac computer in January 2006, six months early. An Intel-based laptop was to go on sale in February. An Intel processor inside a Macintosh put a whole library of Windows-based games and software within the reach of Mac users. Though there were benefits, skeptics questioned Apple's move; in the past, major transactions have lost customers and software developers. Apple helped launch a consortium designed to create new standards to improve the flow of content between TVs, computers and other devices. Speculation is that Apple plans to introduce a Mac Mini computer home entertainment hub. ","Steve Jobs admitted that Apple had been working on the move to Intel for at least five years, creating two versions of its Mac OS X one with the current chips and another by Intel. Jobs said that Macs would top 3 gigahertz speed by summer. The Apple faithful had been caught by surprise by the company's switch. The new Intel chips that Mac will use is called Core Duo that features two computing engines on a single piece of silicon. The new IMacs will be up to two times faster than the older ones using the G5 chip. ","In looking for alternative chips, Jobs talked with Sony but was disappointed with the Cell's design. Adobe Systems and Microsoft vowed to support Macs running existing and new hardware. Apple and Intel helped launch a tech consortium to create new standards to improve content flow between devices. Six months ahead of schedule, Apple introduced the new iMac, twice as fast as before but the same price; and MacBook Pro, four times faster than PowerBook laptops. Both use Intel's Core Duo processor that speeds up simultaneous tasks. The entire line of Macs will shift to Intel by the end of 2006. ","On 10 January, six months ahead of schedule, Apple introduced two new Intel-based computers, an iMac and a laptop called the MacBook Pro. The new iMac is two to three times faster than the old model, while the laptop is four to five times faster, although they cost the same as the old models. Software developers are working on programs that will run on both the Intel and the older Macs. Although the processors inside are the same as those used on Windows-based PCs, the new Macs will not be able to run Windows software.

D0926,D0926-A,"Steve Fossett is waiting on the wind.With all preparations complete for a solo, non-stop flight around the globe, the only thing standing in the way of the legendary adventurers next attempt to set a world record is an uncooperative jet stream.""It's never been an exact science,"" said spokeswoman Anna Burdsall. ""There are two different weather systems we're dealing with -- the ground weather in Salinas, that's one consideration, and the other is the weather and the jet stream going around the world.""The launch of the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer has been delayed a number of times since it arrived in Salinas, Kansas, on January 7.The light-bodied aircraft relies on prevailing winds, or the jet stream, to help push it along its journey. But it needs to avoid the jet stream until it reaches its cruising altitude or else it could be damaged by heavy turbulence.A February 2 launch was cancelled because the jet stream moved too far north, which meant Fossett would lose too much fuel catching up to it to make it the rest of the way around the world.The February 6 and February 8 launches were cancelled because the jet stream moved too close to Kansas and created a situation of heavy wind and turbulence.So Fossett and his crew have remained on high alert, waiting for the perfect weather conditions. The next potential launch date is late next week.""Everyone within the project team understands how these type of projects work,"" said Burdsall, who described the mood of the 30-plus people working on the project as one of anticipation.The project brings together three giants of aviation and adventure.Fossett has set dozens of world records and world firsts with jet airplanes and gliders, hot air balloons and sailing. The American millionaire became famous in the mid 1990s when he made a number of attempts with British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson to fly around the globe in a hot air balloon.Branson, whose company Virgin Atlantic Airways is funding the GlobalFlyer, is acting as the reserve pilot.The British businessman has also set a number of sailing and aviation records in his own right while promoting the Virgin brand. He will monitor Fossett's progress from mission control in Salinas.The GlobalFlyer was designed by Burt Rutan, who recently made headlines when his SpaceShipOne won the 10-million-dollar ""X Prize"" for sending a privately-designed craft into space twice in two weeks.Rutan also designed the Voyager, which was used by his brother Dick Rutan and Jeanne Yeager in 1986 to set a record of nine days for a non-stop, non-refueled flight around the world.Fossett hopes to beat that record by making it in less than 80 hours, and by doing it on his own.""The first solo non-stop is a grand endeavour,"" Fossett said in an interview on the GlobalFlyer Web site.""This will require all of my abilities as a pilot, it will test my endurance, and it will demonstrate the finest in lightweight aircraft construction and improvements in jet engine fuel efficiency that have never before been achieved.""The 3,350-pound (1,522-kilogram) single engine aircraft will carry nearly 19,000 pounds (8,636 kilograms) of fuel in 13 tanks for the 23,000-mile (37,260-kilometer) journey.Some of the major cities Fossett expects to pass along the way are Chicago, Toronto, London, Paris, Rome, Cairo, Bahrain, Karachi, Calcutta, Shanghai, Tokyo, Honolulu and Los Angeles.Virgin is looking for people with high powered telescopes to operate as spotters and take pictures and video of the plane as it flies overhead at 45,000 feet (13,636 meters).
Facts and figures about the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer, which is scheduled to take off from Salina, Kansas, on Monday with American Steve Fossett at the controls:The goal:- a solo, non-stop, non-refueled flight around the world.The journey:- estimated travel time: between 70 and 80 hours.- distance traveled: must be more than 36,787.559 kilometers (equal in length to the Tropic of Cancer) or around 23,000 miles- some of the major cities Fossett will pass along the way: Chicago, Toronto, London, Paris, Rome, Cairo, Bahrain, Karachi, Calcutta, Shanghai, Tokyo, Honolulu and Los Angeles.- estimated speed: 250 knots (285 miles per hour/460 kilometers per hour)- flying altitude: 45,000 feet or 13,000 meters (typical altitude for commercial flights is 33,000 to 37,000 feet)The aircraft:- designed by Burt Rutan's California-based Scaled Composites, which recently won the 10 million dollar ""X Prize"" for sending a privately-designed three-person craft into space twice in two weeks.- the seven-foot-long (2.1-meter-long) pressurized cabin is equipped with a reclining carbon fiber seat so low that Fossett will need to sit on pillows in order to see for takeoff and landing.Specifications:- Wing Span: 114 feet (35 meters)- Length: 44.1 feet (13.41 meters)- Height: 13.3 feet (4.0 meters)- Gross Weight: 22,000 pounds (10,000 kilograms)- Empty Weight: 3,350 pounds (1,522 kilograms)- Number of fuel tanks: 13- Percentage of weight at take-off that is fuel: 83 percent- Engine: Williams FJ44-3 ATW, located above the aft fuselage on the top of the wing- Flight controls: all flight controls are mechanically actuated using cables, push pull tubes and bellcranks and are fully reversible.
The early stages of American adventurer Steve Fossett's bid to make the first solo non-stop flight around the world without refueling aboard the GlobalFlyer have gone ""exactly as planned"", organizers said.""Mission control has spoken with Steve and he reports that everything is working well and that he is extremely pleased with progress so far,"" project manager Paul Moore told a press briefing late Monday.After weeks of weather delays, the GlobalFlyer took off at 6:47 pm (0047 GMT Tuesday) from Salina Municipal Airport on a journey expected to last between 60 and 80 hours.Hundreds of spectators lined the tarmac and cheered as the aircraft, heavily laden down by fuel, trundled down the runway and rose into the darkening sky.There was a brief moment of anxiety when the craft appeared to lose altitude seconds after taking off, before it regained height and climbed into the skies.Fossett spoke briefly to reporters before climbing into the cramped cockpit.""I'm feeling good. I'm feeling healthy. It's going to be a long night tonight and a long night tomorrow night,"" he said.The three-day journey will test Fossetts endurance and his abilities as a pilot.The delicate, light-bodied airplane has been built with very little margin for complications like turbulence and Fossett will need to keep a close eye on the fuel distribution to ensure that the plane remains properly balanced.The greatest potential for structural problems came during the first two hours of the flight when Fossett maneuvered the plane through the ground winds and potential turbulence.At takeoff, the 3,350-pound (1,522-kilogram) single engine aircraft was carrying nearly 19,000 pounds (8,636 kilograms) of fuel in 13 tanks for the 23,000-mile (37,260-kilometer) journey at altitudes as high as 52,000 feet (15,850 meters).Fossett is wearing a chest pack with a parachute and should be able to bail out in less than two minutes if he encounters any critical failures. Once he reaches his cruising altitude of about 45,000 feet (13,000 meters) he can expect a smoother ride.By 10:00pm (0400 GMT, Tuesday) Fossett had traveled 1,400 kilometers (869 miles) and was approaching Canadian airspace after having passed over Chicago and Detroit. He was flying at an altitude of 38,000 feet (11,580 meters) at an approximate speed of 310 knots (357 miles per hour).While in the air, Fossett will be in near-constant contact with mission control here via a NASA-designed communication system.""It was obviously an emotional moment in that I was standing with Steve Fossett's wife. It was a dangerous moment and an enormous relief when it got off the ground and left Salina,"" said British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson, whose Virgin Atlantic Airways is funding the daring venture.""Something I never thought I would get to say was 'next stop Salina,'""  Branson said.A chase plane is following Fossett along the route in order to document the flight and provide support should he be forced into an early landing. Fossett has been equipped with an emergency beacon which would alert search-and-rescue teams to his exact position.Fossett has little room to stretch in the 7.7-foot-long (2.3-meter-long) cabin and will sustain himself with diet milkshakes.Despite the dangers, Fossett said he is determined to try to capture the ""most important aviation records that have been left undone."" ""It's worth the risk,"" he said.The project brings together three giants of aviation and adventure.Fossett has set dozens of world records and world firsts with jet airplanes and gliders, hot air balloons and sailing.The former stock options trader became famous in the mid 1990s when he made an attempt with Branson to circumnavigate the globe in a hot air balloon. He managed the trip solo on his sixth attempt in the summer of 2002.Branson has set a number of sailing and aviation records in his own right while promoting the Virgin brand. He will monitor Fossett's progress from mission control in Salina.The GlobalFlyer was designed by aviation legend Burt Rutan, who recently made headlines when his SpaceShipOne won the 10 million dollar ""X Prize"" for sending a privately-designed craft into space twice in two weeks.Rutan also designed the Voyager, which was used by his brother Dick Rutan and Jeanne Yeager in 1986 to set a record of nine days for a non-stop, non-refueled flight around the world.Fossett hopes to beat that record by making it in less than 80 hours, and by doing it on his own.Once he clears the Canadian province of Newfoundland, Fossett will head across the Atlantic Ocean to Africa. He hopes pass above Casablanca before he continuing on towards Libya, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, China, South Korea and Japan.
American adventurer Steve Fossett flew over Africa on Tuesday after battling a series of equipment problems in the early stages of his bid to make the first solo non-stop flight around the world without refueling.Fossett, who took off from here in the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer on Monday for a flight expected to last between 60 and 80 hours, said he had to deal with a number of ""dramas,"" particularly during takeoff, but the flight was going well overall.At 1607 GMT, Fossett was at approximately 45,000 feet (13,000 meters) and had been in the air for 15 hours and 20 minutes. The GlobalFlyer was over Morocco heading east at a speed of around 340 knots (390 miles per hour/630 kilometers per hour)""At this time everything is going very well,"" Fossett said in a radio hook-up with reporters at Mission Control in Salina. ""I'm very happy with the situation and I think we've got a good chance.""He said the takeoff of the GlobalFlyer, which is essentially a flying gas tank -- 83 percent of the total weight is fuel -- had been difficult. ""It had a lot of dramas in the launch, dramas with equipment failures that had to be solved,"" Fossett said.""The plane was much slower than I expected but fortunately the plane picked up speed and I didn't have to abort,"" he said.Among the problems was a temporary failure of the Global Positioning System, or GPS, Fossett's primary navigation aid.""This was my sole source of navigation so this was very serious,"" he said, adding that the GPS had not functioned for about half of his flight over Canada. ""I believe it was an antenna problem,"" Fossett said.He cautioned that other problems could arise during the flight and there was still a long way to go. ""There may be new things that come up so there's no real basis for confidence,"" he said, ""but I'm happy with the situation.""Fossett said he had consumed three chocolate milkshakes since the flight began. ""It's not exactly my favorite diet but it will certainly serve the purpose for this flight.""At Mission Control, flight controllers were carefully monitoring fuel consumption.""One of the critical factors we are monitoring is the amount of fuel he has left,"" said project manager Paul Moore. ""He's eaten quite substantially into his fuel (so far)  but that's as we expected.""Moore said the GPS problem had been potentially very serious. ""This could have been a showstopper,"" he said. ""This was really a big worry as we are unable to fly without GPS especially when were out of radio range.""Steve was essentially flying blind,"" Moore said. ""Happily, after a couple of hours of malfunction the GPS system did reengage.""The three-day journey will test the endurance and piloting abilities of Fossett, a 60-year-old millionaire who has set dozens of world records and world firsts with jet airplanes and gliders, hot air balloons and sailing.At takeoff, the 3,350-pound (1,522-kilogram) single engine aircraft was carrying nearly 19,000 pounds (8,636 kilograms) of fuel in 13 tanks for the 23,000-mile (37,260-kilometer) journey at altitudes as high as 52,000 feet (15,850 meters).Virgin Atlantic Airways of Sir Richard Branson is funding the GlobalFlyer and the British entrepreneur is in Salina monitoring the flight.The GlobalFlyer was designed by aviation legend Burt Rutan, who recently made headlines when his SpaceShipOne won the 10 million dollar ""X Prize"" for sending a privately-designed craft into space twice in two weeks.Rutan also designed the Voyager, which was used by his brother Dick Rutan and Jeanne Yeager in 1986 to set a record of nine days for a non-stop, non-refueled flight around the world.Fossett hopes to beat that record by making it in less than 80 hours, and by doing it on his own.
American adventurer Steve Fossett likes to joke that his attempt to fly around the world without stopping or refueling has no ""practical"" purpose.But the research that went into developing the super-light and aerodynamic aircraft could one day lead to more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly commercial planes, said Sir Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic, which is funding the project.""As an airline, we hope that Virgin Atlantic airplanes will (one day) be made of composite materials and that metal will be thrown away,"" Branson said at a press conference Monday.The single engine turbofan aircraft designed by Burt Rutans Scale Composites is constructed with lightweight, composite materials in order to maximize fuel efficiency. It is so aerodynamically perfect that it needs drag parachutes to land.While he admits that his taste for adventure and publicity also drove his interest in the GlobalFlyer, Branson said he also hopes that the project will spur further interest in aviation and adventure.""A lot of benefits to mankind come from projects like this,"" Branson said. ""Kids around the world can log in and participate in a great adventure and perhaps aspire to something like it in the future.""The aircraft will also allow the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to test a new state-of-the-art communications system that will one day be used on spacecraft.NASA said that the equipment has the potential to ""reduce the cost and infrastructure of the current ground-based communications systems"" by using satellites to relay tracking and flight data.The GlobalFlyer is also being used as a platform for research into cosmic radiation.The experimental aircraft took off from Salina Municipal Airport here on Monday for a flight around the world that is expected to last between 60 and 80 hours. Fossett crossed the Atlantic and was over Africa on Tuesday.
American adventurer Steve Fossett flew over the Middle East on Tuesday after overcoming a navigation equipment problem that threatened to derail his historic bid to make the first non-stop flight around the world without refueling.Fossett, who took off from here in the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer on Monday for a flight expected to last between 60 and 80 hours, said he hae navigation aid.""This was my sole source of navigation so this was very serious,"" he said, adding that the GPS had not functioned for about half of his flight over Canada.

""This could have been a showstopper,"" he said. ""This was really a big worry as we are unable to fly without GPS especially when were out of radio range.""Steve was essentially flying blind,"" Moore said. ""Happily, after a couple of hours of malfunction the GPS system did reengage.""Moore said cabin pressure was good and the temperature in the cramped cockpit was 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees Celsius). ""His feet are a bit chilly,"" said Moore.The three-day journey will test the endurance and piloting abilities of Fossett, a 60-year-old millionaire who has set dozens of world records and world firsts with jet airplanes and gliders, hot air balloons and sailing.At takeoff, the 3,350-pound (1,522-kilogram) single engine aircraft was carrying nearly 19,000 pounds (8,636 kilograms) of fuel in 13 tanks for the 23,000-mile (37,260-kilometer) journey at altitudes as high as 52,000 feet (15,850 meters).Virgin Atlantic Airways of Sir Richard Branson is funding the GlobalFlyer and the British entrepreneur is in Salina monitoring the flight.The GlobalFlyer was designed by aviation legend Burt Rutan, who recently made headlines when his SpaceShipOne won the 10 million dollar ""X Prize"" for sending a privately-designed craft into space twice in two weeks.Rutan also designed the Voyager, which was used by his brother Dick Rutan and Jeanne Yeager in 1986 to set a record of nine days for a non-stop, non-refueled flight around the world.Fossett hopes to beat that record by making it in less than 80 hours, and by doing it on his own.
US adventurer Steve Fossett was approaching the coast of Pakistan late Tuesday after overcoming a navigation equipment problem that threatened to derail his historic bid to make the first non-stop flight around the world without refueling.Fossett, who took off from here in the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer on Monday for a flight expected to last between 60 and 80 hours, said he had to deal with a number of ""dramas"" during takeoff but the flight was going well overall.At 03:30 GMT, Fossett was at 48,197 feet (14,700 meters) and had been in the air for nearly 27 hours. The GlobalFlyer was over the Arabian sea heading east towards Karachi, Pakistan at speeds of around 340 knots (390 miles per hour/630 kilometers per hour).Earlier in the day, in a radio hook-up with reporters at Mission Control in Salina, Fossett said he had a ""good chance"" of completing the record-breaking flight.""I have picked up a 100 mile per hour (160 kilometers) jet stream just behind mew and I am covering territory fast, which is very encouraging,"" he said. ""It's interesting to watch things go by and I am looking forward to another good day tomorrow.""The most serious problem was a temporary failure of the Global Positioning System, or GPS, Fossett's satellite navigation aid.""This was my sole source of navigation so this was very serious,"" he said, adding that the GPS had not functioned for about half of his flight over Canada.

Millionaire adventurer Steve Fossett has taken off on his attempt to become thefirst person to complete a solo trip around the world in an airplane withoutmaking a single stop.Fossett, the first person to circle the globe solo in a balloon, launched hisGlobalFlyer from the Salina Municipal Airport shortly before 7 p.m. Monday,beginning a 66-hour journey by climbing northeast into a darkeningsky.Hundreds of spectators, braving a bitterly cold wind, gathered along thetwo-mile (three-kilometer) runway to watch the takeoff. Fossett hoped to returnto Salina on Thursday morning.The 23,000-mile (37,000-kilometer) flight had already been postponed severaltimes because of shifting jet stream patterns or weather at theairport.""I'm a bit nervous about takeoff,"" said Fossett, 60, who has logged about 30hours in the jet-powered aircraft. ""I will be the ultimate test pilot. I have alot to worry about. It's a major endeavor.""Financed by Virgin Atlantic founder Sir Richard Branson, it would be the firstsolo flight around the world without stopping to refuel.Branson watched the takeoff from the side of the runway with Fossett's wife. ""Itwas obviously an emotional moment and the most dangerous part of the journey,""he said. ""It was an enormous relief when it actually came off theground.""By late Monday night, Fossett was soaring over Canada.""He was pretty determined to get away,"" project manager Paul Moore said at abriefing hours after the takeoff.Aviation pioneer Wiley Post made the first solo around-the-world trip in 1933,taking more than seven days and stopping numerous times along the way. The firstnonstop global flight without refueling by a duo was made in 1986 by JeanaYeager and Dick Rutan, brother of Burt Rutan, designer of theGlobalFlyer.Besides the nonstop record, Fossett will attempt to break seven other aviationrecords, including the longest flight by a jet aircraft. The current record ismore than 12,000 miles (19,300 kilometers), set by a B-52 bomber in1962.Mission control director Kevin Stass said Fossett would fly over Chicago,Detroit and Canada before heading across the Atlantic late Monday night. Theroute would then take him over Africa, the Middle East, India, China and thePacific Ocean.The flight plan was adjusted once more later Monday after Algeria closed aportion of its airspace, mission control director Kevin Stass said. The change,he said, would slightly reduce the overall length of the flight and save some ofthe 18,000 pounds ( 8,100 kilograms) of fuel aboard the single-enginejet.Fossett planned to fly at an average speed of 287.5 mph (462.6 kph) and rely onthe jet stream to stretch his fuel. The GlobalFlyer will have about 15 percentextra fuel to allow for weather conditions or other changes to the flight plan,said Jon Karkow, chief engineer for the flight.There was a risk the fuel could freeze from flying in the cold at altitudes of52,000 feet (15,600 meters) for such a long time.Fossett will survive on diet milkshakes. ""I just picked a bunch of flavors offthe shelf at the store,"" he said.Branson planned to follow Fossett in a chase plane for the first day of theflight and on the last leg. He gave Fossett his wristwatch, complete withemergency beacon device, to wear for the flight.""We want you and (the watch) back in one piece at the end,"" Bransonquipped.Fossett became the first to fly a balloon solo around the world in 2002 afternearly dying twice in six attempts to set the record. He has also tried to breakthe world gliding altitude record for the past four years in New Zealand but hasfailed because of poor conditions.___On the Net:
Kansas town basks in glow og GlobalFlyerBy LAURA BAUERThe Kansas City Star SALINA, Kan. -- Anytime Jeff Palmer hearsa plane overhead, he peers out the front window ofMr. G's Market.""I look to see if it's the GlobalFlyer,"" says Palmer, whofrom behind the store counter demonstrates how he bends downand tilts his head toward the sky.For more than two weeks the store cashier has been peeringout this window, hoping to get a glimpse of thecutting-edge plane designed to break yet another aviation record formillionaire adventurer Steve Fossett.Having already shattered records in a hot-air balloon and a glider,Fossett hopes to soon become the first to make asolo, nonstop flight around the world without refueling.As early as next Sunday, the first window of opportunity, Palmershould get a pretty good look at the plane asFossett and the Virgin Atlantic team attempt the feat fromthe Salina airport, less than a mile from Mr. G's.The team was attracted to the central Kansas town and itsairport for the extra-long runway and newly renovated hangar 703.It's inside hangar 703 where the GlobalFlyer, with its 114-feet wingspan and 13 gas tanks, has been housed and workedon since it arrived from Mojave, Calif., on Jan. 6.While the team waits for good weather around the world, constantlymeasuring barometric pressures and monitoring jet streams, residents are preparingfor what they say is their town's best bet toget into the history books.Employees at the Holiday Inn are ready to roll out theirred carpet -- literally -- for the hordes of internationaland national reporters and television crews. The hotel bar isconcocting a special GlobalFlyer drink, with ingredients not yet revealed.""It'll be like the flight,"" says smiling Holiday Inn sales managerGala Bloyd, referring to how the details of the missionare kept under wraps until closer to the departure. ""We'llannounce that (the ingredients) when they take off.""The welcome parties are planned for people like Virgin Atlantic's chairman,Sir Richard Branson, and town leaders have scheduled tours tointroduce Salina to an international audience. Hundreds of volunteers arelined up to make sure guests are treated right.""This gives us the opportunity to introduce our visitors here towhat this community is all about,"" says Gerald Cook, presidentof the Salina Area Chamber of Commerce, who has alreadyfielded questions from reporters in New York, London and Italy.""It's a show and tell, if you will.""But before all that, and before Fossett hits the sky forwhat could be up to an 80-hour flight, some preparationsremain. For Fossett, the crews from Virgin Atlantic and ScaledComposites (which designed and built the plane) and the KansasState University Airway Science students who've become an integral partof the mission, there's a lot of unfinished business.When officials with Virgin Atlantic came to look at the Salinaairport facilities and runway, which measures 12,300 feet long, theyvisited Salina's K-State campus. The location's main focus is itsCollege of Technology and Aviation.By that time Salina officials knew there was a good probabilitythe town would be the location for the launch andthe landing. But they had no idea where the flightwould be controlled from, or in more technical terms, whereMission Control would be.""It could have been in London, Hong Kong, anywhere,"" says TimRogers, executive director of the Salina Airport Authority. But ""whenthey saw the campus facility, immediately the light came onfor Virgin Atlantic staffers, 'This is ideal for Mission Control.'""Shortly after the announcement was made that the entire mission wouldtake place in Salina, school officials got in touch withseveral Airway Science students -- aspiring professional pilots and airplanemechanics. From there, 12 students were hand-picked to help onthe mission.They thought they would run a few errands, do minor researchand, if they were lucky, pick up valuable knowledge fromseasoned aviation professionals.Monica Chester, a senior from Phillipsburg in the professional pilot program,laughs now as she and three other students describe howthey are instead helping map the mission's flight plan byresearching weather patterns and jet streams.And the eight aviation mechanics students are helping improve and repairthe plane to ensure a successful mission.""It's definitely not a stand-back-and-see-how-it's-done kind of job,"" Chester says. ""It'sstep up and get it done.""Under the supervision of Philip Grassa, the crew chief from ScaledComposites, the aviation mechanics students work nearly every day onthe plane. After a test flight, the students helped repaira valve that was causing trouble with cabin pressure.Earlier last week the students installed the flight tires on theplane. The tires were new, but the tread was shaveddown to save on weight.""They didn't think they'd get to work on the airplane asan actual mechanic,"" says Grassa, who has worked on GlobalFlyerfor two years. ""They thought they'd be running errands forme.""Grassa hollers, ""How we doing over there?"" to a small groupworking on a shield to go over the flight controlsin the back of the cabin.After offering a suggestion of where to put glue, Grassa wasback to talking about the students and how they havebeen integral in helping get GlobalFlyer ready.""This is basically my adopted crew for the preparation for thismission,"" Grassa says.Some of the students get wide eyes as they talk aboutworking with Scaled Composites employees and with Fossett -- whomsenior Seth Short from Burrton describes as ""your grandpa inreal good physical shape. He's as nice as can be.""As Chester puts it: ""We hoped we'd get to meet him,but now we're on a first-name basis with him.""For the students in the professional pilot program, their work isin front of the computer calculating fluctuations in the weather.They balance the benefits of flying at high altitudes wherethe jet engine is more efficient versus lower where aplane gets the best winds.Short explains how the weather needs to be just right.""We're looking for cold weather, high barometric pressure and favorable jetstream,"" says Short. ""He can't take off in any precipitationthat would freeze.""Another pilot student, Nancy Milleret of Tonganoxie, jumps in to interpret.""You don't want ice on the plane,"" says the junior whois used to breaking down aviation talk to the studentsshe guides in the air. ""Ice is bad.""That's because the plane is not equipped with de-icing gear. Thatwould add weight to the plane. And for a triparound the world without refueling, extra weight is also bad.Student Pat Rinearson of Olathe explains why the plane needs thefavorable jet stream.""He wants the tail winds,"" Rinearson says. ""The jet stream movesevery minute. What we're trying to do is figure outwhere it is and average what the tail wind componentwill be through the flight.""The plane will travel east to west. It doesn't have enoughgas to make the 20,000-nautical-mile trip without the benefit oftail winds. As Milleret explains: ""West to east, he wouldn'tmake it.

One hundred one years after the Wright brothers ushered inthe age of powered flight, Steve Fossett is ready totackle what may be the last great challenge in worldaviation. From Kansas, not Kitty Hawk.Weather permitting, the 60-year-old millionaire will take off from the Salina,Kan., municipal airport today and be back three days later,by way of Montreal; London; Paris; Rome; Cairo, Egypt; Bahrain;Karachi, Pakistan; Calcutta, India; Shanghai; Tokyo; Honolulu; and Los Angeles.There will be no stops. No refueling. And not much sleepfor Fossett, who will be wedged in the 7 footcockpit of a veritable flying fuel tank as he attemptsthe first solo flight around the world on one tankof gas.If he's successful, Fossett will earn a place in history alongsideaviator Wiley Post, who circled the globe alone in 1933in a single-engine airplane, the Winnie Mae. Post made 11stops and took just under eight8 days.""Flying around the world has always been a great adventure,"" Fossettsays. ""I hope to make it with no stops andin under 80 hours.""It won't be his first around-the-world flight. In 2002, he becamethe first person to solo the globe in a balloon-- a 14-day odyssey, which began and ended in Australia.It was his sixth attempt.The solo aspect of the record is important to Fossett.""Ninety-one people flew across the Atlantic before (Charles) LIndbergh did,"" hesays. ""The hallmarks of aviation are that solo flights areranked higher than crew flights just because of the difficultyand the level of self-reliance required.""He may be flying solo, but he will be supported bymore than 40 engineers, meteorologists and pilots at Salina ""missioncontrol"" who will advise him by radio as he circlesthe globe. A network of amateur spotters will report ""Fossettsightings"" as he travels. And a chase plane will rendezvouswith him several times during the three-day flight.Fossett, who made his fortune as a trader on the ChicagoBoard Options Exchange, is the most visible of three aviationgiants who have pooled their talents for the record attempt.Virgin Atlantic Airways founder and chairman Richard Branson, himself an avidballoonist, is funding the $2.5 million project, which he calls""the last great aviation record inside the Earth's atmosphere andthe first great aviation achievement of this century.""Branson, whose $2.2 billion net worth makes him No. 247 onForbes' list of the world's richest people, isn't fretting aboutthe cost. Besides, he says the flight will demonstrate technologythat will help develop ""a new generation of more fuel-efficientcommercial aircraft.""The airplane is decked out in the red-and-white livery of Branson'sairline, but the craft is the brainchild of aviation designgenius Burt Rutan, whose SpaceShipOne last year became the firstprivately built craft to reach the edge of space. Rutanwon the $10 million Ansari X Prize for the advancementof space tourism.The Virgin Atlantic Global Flyer -- first sketched by Rutan onthe back of a napkin in 1999 -- is undoubtedlyone of the strangest-looking flying machines ever to take wingover the Kansas heartland.Built by Rutan's Scaled Composites of Mojave, Calif., it consists oftwo 44-foot lightweight carbon fiber torpedoes joined at the hip.A cigar-shaped cockpit is suspended between, with a single jetengine -- a modified turbofan like those used in corporatejets -- mounted above and behind the cockpit. Fossett hasto sit on padded cushions to see out of thebubble-like canopy.The design is so aerodynamically perfect that the plane has todeploy two drogue parachutes to help it descend for alanding. With a 114-foot wing span that makes it 21/2 times wider than it is long, however, the contraptionlooks like it might have trouble just getting off theground.Taking off may, in fact, be one of the toughest challenges.Fully loaded, the plane carries 3,000 gallons of jet fuel,six times its own weight. Commercial airliners carry less thanhalf their weight in fuel.At takeoff, because so much fuel is stored in the plane'shollow wings, they will droop to within 3 feet ofthe runway -- meaning any sudden gust of wind couldbecome an adventure-ending disaster.""It's an experimental aircraft with such lightweight construction there's a riskof structural failure,"" Fossett says. ""The first time it flieswith a full load of fuel will be when Itake off on the mission. If I miscalculate, I willrun right into the cornfields.""The dicey aspects of the takeoff are one reason Fossett chosethe Salina airport. Its 12,300-foot runway and a 1,300-foot overrun-- built when it was Schilling Air Force Base --provide plenty of room for the Global Flyer to getup to takeoff speed.Once he is airborne, Fossett intends to climb to around 50,000feet, well above the altitude flown by commercial traffic. Theplane will be so heavy early in the flights thathe'll have to avoid the turbulence of the jet stream.As the plane's fuel load lightens, however, the jet stream willplay a major role in whether Fossett will make ithome. As he crosses Europe, the Middle East, Asia andthe Pacific Ocean, he hopes to use the tailwind toadd an average of 70 miles to his ground speedand increase his range.The Global Flyer carries only enough fuel to cover 20,000 milesin still air -- a good 3,000 miles short ofthe 36,787.559-kilometer minimum distance required for the arbiter of worldaviation records, the Paris-based Federation Aeronautique Internationale, to recognize thefeat.But Fossett has another reason for using a midcontinent location forhis takeoff and return. In the final hours, he'll berunning close to empty.""If I run out of fuel in the last thousand miles,I will be able to glide to a safe landingat almost any airport in the western United States,"" hesays. ""If I had chosen a West Coast airport, Iwould risk ditching in the Pacific.""So critical is the jet stream to Fossett's ambitions -- bothas an early obstacle and a late-in-the-game friend -- thatthe flight has already been delayed more than two weeksin hopes of a more favorable alignment.Although the plane has been ready to fly since Feb. 2,the weather has prompted several delays. A meteorological ""go"" requiresthe proper speed and course of winds aloft, the rightlocal weather (cold and calm) for the absence of anymajor storms along Fossett's planned route.""Looking at the behavior of the jet stream over the lastfive5 or 10 years, things only line up the waywe need them about 50 percent of the time,"" saysDavid Dehenauw, a Belgian meteorologist doing long-range forecasting for theflight.The Global Flyer won't be the first airplane to circle theworld without refueling. Voyager, an earlier Rutan creation that nowhangs in the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum, did thatin 1986.But Voyager had two pilots, Burt Rutan's older brother Richard Rutanand pilot Jeana Yeager. It also had two engines anda speed that averaged a little over 100 miles anhour. Because it couldn't fly high enough to make useof the jet stream, the flight took nine days --and nearly failed when it had to be rerouted dueto Libya's refusal to let the plane enter its airspace.Unlike his marathon balloon flights, which have allowed time for napping,Fossett -- cruising at nearly 300 miles an hour --will have to stay awake for most, if not all,of the 80 hours he is airborne.But as a precaution, the plane also carries a control systemthat would maintain the course in the event Fossett nodsoff.Fossett hasn't said publicly what he'll do if he doesn't makeit, but his earlier balloon flights have made it clearthat he doesn't quit easily.His successful around-the-world flight in 2002 was his sixth attempt ineight years -- including one flight that ended in anear disaster when a thunderstorm shredded his balloon and hehad to ditch off the coast of Australia. He waspicked up by a passing yacht -- and promptly beganmaking preparations for his next attempt.Mike Toner writes for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. E-mail: mtoner@ajc.com
","Steve Fossett's attempt at the first around-the-world non-stop no-refueling solo flight began with takeoff of the Global Flyer from Salina (Kansas) Municipal Airport at 0047GMT on March 1, 2005. Fossett described takeoff as ""difficult"" as the aircraft was slower than he had expected. By 0400GMT he was over Canada where he experienced a GPS malfunction, but after a couple of hours it reengaged. At 1607GMT he was over Morocco and by 0330GMT March 2nd the Global Flyer was over the Arabian Sea heading east towards Karachi, Pakistan at about 390mph. ","Steve Fossett left Monday evening from Salina on a solo, nonstop, non-refueled flight around the world in the Global Flyer. He estimated flying time at 60-80 hours. He took off at 6:47 and was concerned for a brief moment when the plane seemed to lose altitude seconds after taking off. By 10 PM he approached Canadian airspace and soared toward the Atlantic Ocean. While flying across Canada Fossett's GPS malfunctioned. After a couple of hours the GSP corrected itself. Monitoring fuel usage was a critical challenge during the flight. Fossett flew over Africa and the Middle East on Tuesday. ","Steve Fossett, hopes to become the first person to fly solo, non-stop flight around the world without refueling. Fossett's plane, the Global Flyer, was designed by Burt Rutan and the flight is funded by Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic Airways. Departure depends on favorable weather. His plane does not carry enough fuel for the trip without tail winds. The flight will begin and terminate at Salina, Kansas. Fossettt hopes to make the trip in under 80 hours. The flight began at 6:47 PM on Monday, March 1st. By late Tuesday after overcoming a navigational equipment problem, he was approaching Pakistan. ","Steve Fossett and his Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer arrived in Salina, Kansas, on January 7, 2005, to prepare for his solo, non-stop flight around the globe. He finally took off at 0047 GMT on Tuesday, March 1. By 0400, he was approaching Canadian air space after flying over Chicago and Detroit. He then flew over Canada and the Atlantic Ocean and was over Morocco at 1607. After flying over Africa, he was over the Arabian Sea, approaching Karachi, Pakistan, at 0330 on Wednesday."

As a result, he can only take power naps for the rest of the three-day journey.On Tuesday, in a series of radio hook-ups with reporters at Mission Control here, Fossett said he had a ""good chance"" of completing the record-breaking flight.""I have picked up a 100 mile per hour (160 kilometers) jet stream just behind me and I am covering territory fast, which is very encouraging,"" he said. ""It's interesting to watch things go by and I am looking forward to another good day tomorrow.""The most serious problem was a temporary failure of the Global Positioning System, Fossett's satellite navigation aid.""This was my sole source of navigation, so this was very serious,"" he said, adding that the GPS had not functioned for about half of his flight over Canada. ""I believe it was an antenna problem,"" he said.He cautioned that other problems could arise and that there was still a long way to go.

""His feet are a bit chilly,"" said Moore.Fossett nonetheless reported being ""comfortable enough"" in the 7.7 foot (2.3 meter) long cockpit.""I have got elbow room, I can get to everything, I'm not complaining,"" he said. ""It is a long trip - especially the nights. I feel a little bit tired, but I have been through this before and I am going to be okay.""The three-day journey will test the endurance and piloting abilities of Fossett, a 60-year-old millionaire who has set dozens of world records with jet airplanes and gliders, hot air balloons and sailing.British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson - who has set a number of aviation and sailing records of his own - is funding the project through his company Virgin Atlantic Airways.Interest in the record-setting attempt has drawn journalists from all over the world to Salinas, and the mission's website, virginatlanticglobalflyer.com, has drawn more than eight million hits the past 24 hours.

American adventurer Steve Fossett said Wednesday he may be forced to abort his mission to circle the globe without stopping after experiencing significant fuel loss on takeoff.Fossett called the previously undetected loss of an extra 2,600 pounds (1,181 kilograms) of fuel ""a huge setback.""""I don't have a very high level of confidence at this point,"" Fossett told reporters from his plane, adding: ""I'm going to do the best I can.""Fossett said he would have to maintain a tailwind speed of 67 miles (180 kilometers) per hour, the average up to now, to finish his attempt.Earlier Wednesday, Fossett passed the halfway point in his effort to make the first solo, non-stop flight around the world without refueling and with almost no sleep.Fossett took off from this Midwestern US state on Monday and was to return here Thursday morning after spending between 60 and 80 hours in the air. The 3,350-pound (1,522-kilo) single-engine aircraft was to burn nearly 19,000 pounds (8,636 kilos) of fuel.The attempt is being bankrolled by Virgin Atlantic founder and entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson, who has set a number of aviation and sailing records of his own.
American adventurer Steve Fossett, seeking to make the first solo flight around the globe without refueling, is running low on fuel but will fly at least as far as Hawaii before deciding whether to continue, officials said Wednesday.""I'm pleased to say that based on the information provided to him by the team here at Mission Control, Steve has decided that he will fly at least as far as Hawaii,"" Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer project manager Paul Moore told reporters.""He will then make a further decision at that stage as to whether he feels comfortable and confident to fly beyond Hawaii towards the west coast of the US,"" he added.Fossett is running low on fuel and Mission Control had been considering whether to abort the flight in Hawaii or have the plane turn back towards Japan.At 2000 GMT on Wednesday, Fossett was east of Japan flying over the Pacific towards Hawaii.He took off from an airport here on Monday and is hoping to touch down in Salina on Thursday, becoming the first person ever to make a solo non-stop, non-refueled flight around the world.
American adventurer Steve Fossett has decided to continue his historic bid for the first solo non-refueled flight around the world despite loss of fuel, project managers announced here late Wednesday. ""Let's go for it,"" Fossett told Mission Control via satellite radio as his plane cruised north of Hawaii. Project manager Paul Moore told reporters that the goal of the first solo non-stop, non-refueled circumnavigation of the globe was ""within Steve's grasp,"" despite the fact that the plane had leaked fuel. The mission was called into question earlier Wednesday, when it was discovered the plane had 2,600 pounds (1,181 kilograms) less fuel than expected. While the cause of the loss has not been determined, organizers said it was possible that the fuel evaporated or escaped. More fuel than expected may have been used during takeoff.The plane had never before been flown with full tanks and some fuel may have spilled out through a venting system used to maintain adequate pressure in the tanks, organizers said. A leak is unlikely as the fuel loss ceased after the first few hours of flight.Organizers are hopeful that Fossett will be able to make it back to Salina on Thursday if tailwinds remain strong. 
Exhaustion began to set in as American adventurer Steve Fossett reached the final legs of his epic bid at the first solo, non-stop non-refueled flight around the world, which he is confident he will complete despite some loss of fuel. When asked how he felt after his second full day of flying, Fossett late Wednesday told reporters via satellite phone: ""It feels like three days.""""I've gotten minimal naps while keeping my eyes on the instruments,"" he added, explaining that because of the west-to-east direction he is flying, he ""had to do four nights in a two and a half day trip.""The 60-year-old millionaire had a stressful night after the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer support team at Mission Control here discovered that he had 2,600 pounds (1,181 kilograms) less fuel than expected. The 3,350-pound (1,522-kilo) single-engine aircraft lifted off from here with 18,100 pounds (8,210 kilos) of fuel on Monday.For much of the day there were concerns that Fossett would have to abort the mission and land in Hawaii.But by 04:00 GMT Thursday, Fossett and his crew determined that he had sufficient fuel to continue onward.""The jet stream has been extraordinary. That allowed me to make up some time. In addition I've practiced fuel conservation."" Fossett said. ""I have every hope of making it to Salina.""Fossett said he was happy to hear that he had already broken one record: the longest non-stop distance traveled by a jet airplane.He sounded personally touched to hear about the vast public interest his journey had generated. On launch, the mission's Web site, www.virginatlanticglobalflyer.com, received 2.8 million hits. Between 04:00 GMT Wednesday and 04:00 GMT Thursday, the site received 76 million hits.While the cause of the fuel loss has not been determined, organizers said it was possible that fuel evaporated or escaped or that more fuel than expected was used during takeoff.The plane had never flown before with full tanks and some fuel may have spilled out through a venting system used to maintain adequate pressure in the tanks, organizers said. A leak is unlikely, they added, as the fuel loss ceased after the first few hours of flight.The plane's four main tanks are equipped with sensors, but not the additional tanks in the wings, where it was impossible to detect a possible leak until they began draining into the main boom tanks.By the time Fossett reached Hawaii the wing tanks had begun to drain and it appeared there were no further fuel losses, said project manager Paul Moore.Organizers are now hopeful that Fossett will be able to make it back to Salina by Thursday midday (around 18:00 GMT) if tailwinds remain strong. The plane was equipped at takeoff with 15 percent more fuel than it was expected to use.It also has a strong glide capacity and could make the last 200 miles (325 kilometers) on an empty tank if necessary. Moore said that given the current fuel situation, Fossett should be able to land with fuel to spare. However, Moore cautioned that a number of problems could arise in the coming hours to force Fossett to abort the flight.""Some things have gone in Steve's favor in the last few hours,"" he said. ""But Steve and the Global Flyer are close to the limits of their endurance."" An unscheduled landing would not pose a risk, Moore said. ""Although Steve required a huge runway to takeoff, there are a number of airstrips that Steve can safely land on,"" he said.At 0930 GMT Thursday, Fossett was flying over the Pacific Ocean, 1,151 miles (1852) kilometers southwest of California, at an elevation of 46,282 feet (14,107 meters) and a speed of 255 miles per hour (410 kilometers per hour). He had been flying for more than 53 hours.The three-day journey is a severe test of endurance and piloting abilities for Fossett, who has set dozens of world records with jet airplanes and gliders, hot air balloons and sailing.The attempt is being bankrolled by Virgin Atlantic founder and entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson, who has set a number of aviation and sailing records of his own.The GlobalFlyer was designed by aviation legend Burt Rutan, who recently made headlines when his SpaceShipOne won the 10 million dollar ""X Prize"" for sending a privately-designed craft into space twice in two weeks. Rutan also designed the Voyager, which was used by his brother Dick Rutan and Jeanne Yeager in 1986 to fly around the world without stopping or refueling in nine days.Fossett hopes to beat that record by making it in less than 80 hours, and by doing it on his own.
Madcap aviator Steve Fossett glided his GlobalFlyerto a picture perfect landing here Thursday 67 hours after taking off,becoming the first pilot to circle the globe nonstop, alone andwithout refueling.Fossett stayed awake by drinking a dozen chocolate proteinmilkshakes as he broke what his supporters consider the last greataviation feat. His mission of some 23,000 miles set several worldrecords, registering as the fastest nonstop flight around the world.``That's something I've wanted to do for some time,'' Fossett, 60,said, shortly after squeezing out of the tiny cockpit before a raucouscrowd of about 5,000. ``I've achieved my ambition.''After landing, Fossett exchanged high-fives with Britishbillionaire Richard Branson, a long-time friend who financed theproject and commissioned legendary aircraft designer Burt Rutan tobuild the catamaran-shaped plane. It was powered by a single jetengine.``Can you walk?'' Branson asked Fossett before spraying him withchampagne.The flight marked the second major privately funded aerospace eventsince the fall with a Rutan design. In October Rutan's SpaceShipOnerocket soared into the edge of space on a suborbital flight and backwith a single pilot, claiming a $10-million prize.By contrast, Fossett's round-the-world solo flight was done for thetechnological and human endurance challenge, with no prize moneyinvolved.In recent decades most aviation records have been set by commercialaircraft or government-funded space missions. Aviation enthusiastsapplauded Fossett's exploit as a reminder of the early days of flightwhen adventurous pilots frequently broke records, became instantcelebrities and drew front-page newspaper headlines and massivecrowds.In Fossett's case, much of the town of Salina showed up at theairport to welcome him, including a high school marching band andseveral people holding up signs: ``Go Go GlobalFlyer!''``It's the biggest thing that ever happened in our lives,'' saidAmber Windholz, a 17-year-old baton twirler for the band.The first plane to circumnavigate the globe nonstop and withoutrefueling was another designed by Rutan, the Voyager in 1986. But thataircraft was powered by two propeller engines and flown by two pilotstaking turns. And it took nine days to fly around the world.Fossett began his journey Monday at 6:47 p.m. CST when the StarTrek-lookalike craft, with a 114-foot wingspan took off from theSalina Municipal Airport with 18,000 pounds of fuel -- or about 82percent of the aircraft's weight.Salina was chosen mainly because its runway is one of the longestin the Midwest, and because it allowed Fossett to spend the lastsegment of his mission over land.To break the world record,Fossett had to fly the craft more than22,858 miles, or the same circumference as the Tropic of Cancer, andpass a dozen waypoints.During the flight, Fossett kept to drinking protein milkshakes,which minimized bowel movements while providing nutrition. He alsotook half a dozen catnaps of about one to three minutes.A millionaire and former options trader in Chicago, Fossett hasbroken 60 aviation records, competed in triathlons and the 1,100 mileIditarod sled dog race in Alaska. In 2002 he became the first pilot tomake a solo, nonstop hot air balloon around the world in 13 days and 8hours .Beside the fastest and the longest records Fossett has broken, theTennessee native also set the world record for the slowest swim acrossthe English Channel, completing the 21-mile ocean swim in 22 hours.``Steve is a different animal than most of us,'' Rutan said.At 1:48 p.m. CST, Fossett landed the GlobalFlyer on the same runwaywhere he took off 67 hours, 2 minutes and 38 seconds earlier. The gastank caps and the cockpit door still had the same adhesive tape thatbeen applied before the flight as a way a way to verify there were nosurreptitious refueling stops.The trip wasn't without tense moments. Problems with some equipmentjeopardized the mission at the onset and toward the end.In the early part of the flight, Fossett had to rely on directionsfrom mission control because of problems with the aircraft's globalpositioning system, which provides near precise geographic location ofthe aircraft.Then toward the end, as he flew past Japan and began the trekacross the Pacific, gauges showed that the airplane was low on fuel.Fossett decided to continue after the airplane picked up strongtailwinds of up to 160 miles per hour.``We got beautiful tailwinds over the Pacific,'' said Rutan. ``Ifwe didn't have the tailwinds, we would not have made it.''Fossett looked surprisingly refreshed after he landed. But one ofhis first wishes, he said, was to be able to ``sleep for a full day.''Hart reported from Kansas, Pae from Los Angeles.
Millionaire adventurer Steve Fossett's solo flight around the worldflight encountered its first major hurdle Wednesday with the discoveryof a serious fuel shortage aboard his Global Flyer thatthreatened to cut short the journey.As Fossett was flying over mainland China, mission control officials inSalina, Kan. reported their conclusion that he had a fuelshortage -- 2,600 pounds, or 450 gallons -- less thanthey had counted on.The shortage was blamed on a discrepancy between gauges monitoring therate of fuel consumption and fuel tank sensors measuring theremaining fuel. ""This is a huge setback to think wemight not have enough fuel for the remainder of theflight,"" Fossett said.Despite the bad news, Fossett decided to press on to Hawaiiand re-evaluate his fuel supply when he reached the islands,sometime around 10 p.m. EST Wednesday.If he continues, he expected to land at Salina Municipal Airportaround midday today.""The whole mission is jeopardized, but we will just have totake it one step at a time,"" Fossett said.Fossett, who left Monday night on the solo flight, was takingcatnaps Wednesday to stay alert.He planned to pump fuel from the airplane's dozen or sowing tanks to two central fuel booms to get afinal, accurate measurement of exactly how much fuel remained.""I don't have a very high level of confidence at thispoint,"" he conceded. ""The fuel that remains in the wingsstill has to be transferred to the main tanks, andif there is some kind of blockage, that could boilthe whole clam.""He and mission control officials said they would decide Wednesday nightwhether to press on to the west coast of theUnited States, seven hours of flying time away, to returnto Fossett's starting point in Salina.""Steve and all of us in mission control are fairly optimistic,but there is still a long, long way to go,""said mission director Paul Moore.As Fossett started across the Pacific, his single-engine jet was burningapproximately 30 gallons of jet fuel an hour, with enoughfuel estimated on board for another 25 hours or soof flying.With the aid of a 110-mile-per-hour tail wind and a groundspeed of nearly 400 miles per hour, that would bemore than enough to get him all the way toKansas. But flight officials said they expected the tail windsto subside east of Hawaii, and that could make thedifference.Once the fuel is exhausted, the Global Flyer would be lightenough to allow Fossett to glide the last 200 milesof his journey.""Right now he has insufficient fuel to make it home withouta tail wind,"" Moore reported. ""Steve is quite literally atthe mercy of the winds.""Fully loaded at takeoff, his single-engine jet carried 18,100 pounds offuel, so the missing fuel amounted to nearly 15 percentof the plane's total. Because the Global Flyer's full loadof fuel included about a 15 percent margin, mission controlofficials said the chances of completing his flight were tooclose to call.Mission control officials said the first indication of a fuel problemcame within hours of takeoff. ""We saw it early inthe flight, but we really didn't want to admit thatthe discrepancy was real,"" engineering director Jon Karkow acknowledged Wednesday.""It now looks like that within the first three anda half hours of flights, 2,600 pounds of fuel simplydisappeared.""Mission engineers still aren't sure what happened, but they said fuelapparently vented unexpectedly from the craft's four wing tanks duringthe aircraft's initial climb to cruising altitude.Until the start of its global flight, the plane -- whichcarries six times its own weight in fuel -- hadnever taken off with a full load, a maneuver sorisky that Fossett didn't want to try it until hewas ready to circle the globe.Mike Toner writes for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

For GlobalFlyer, ""Mission Accomplished""By DIANE CARROLLThe Kansas City Star SALINA. Kan. -- Steve Fossett had justendured 67 hours in a cramped cockpit, with only milkshakesfor sustenance, not knowing for half the way whether hehad enough fuel to get home.But when he emerged from the cockpit of his GlobalFlyer at2 p.m., having become the first to fly a planesolo around the world without refueling, one might have thoughthe was returning from an afternoon jaunt.The burly 60-year-old, dressed in a silvery flight suit, popped outhis head, acknowledged the crowd gathered at Salina Municipal Airportwith a wave and walked steadily into the arms ofhis wife, Peggy Fossett. Then, in a most understated way,he told the crowd: ""I'm a really lucky guy. Igot to achieve my ambition.""Fossett seemed to take his latest adventure in stride, but cityleaders and aviation authorities called it a very big deal.""This is a monumental achievement in aviation,"" said David Hawksett ofLondon, who assesses scientific achievements for Guinness World Records. Interms of significant firsts, he said, Fossett's feat is onpar with the 1969 moon landing and the 1953 climbup Mount Everest.""This kind of thing makes people sit up and say, 'Wow,look what can be done!""'More important, Hawksett said, it ""inspires kids all over the world.""Clif Berry Jr., who wrote 2002's Milestones of the First Centuryof Flight , said Fossett's accomplishment was ""an incredible feat.""""Just imagine, there you are all alone at 45,000 feet, withno chance to refuel. It's just marvelous,"" Berry said""I do hope it inspires the young and old to havetheir own challenges and go after them.""Sylvia Rice, vice president of the Salina Chamber of Commerce, saidFossett's achievement put her city on the map. It isa significant addition to the city's already rich aviation history,she said.""Everyone was so excited to see that plane come in,"" Ricesaid. ""You could feel the adrenaline and emotion, and peoplewere crying, and it was wonderful.""Mission control directors estimated the crowd in the thousands. People werestrung out in groups along the 2.5-mile runway.Shortly before the 1:47 p.m. touchdown, the mission's project director toldmedia gathered on the south side of the runway thatFossett would not do a flyover because turbulence had madethe plane difficult to handle.""The aircraft is so light now that he is not goingto take the risk,"" director Paul Moore said. ""The mainthing is that he cruises down safely.""The landing looked perfect.Jon Karkow, chief engineer for Scaled Composites, the company that designedand built the plane, said Fossett did an excellent jobof bringing the plane down. It had about 1,100 poundsof fuel left, enough to fly about another 10 hours.The GlobalFlyer was leaking a little hydraulic fluid, Karkow said, andhad a few bugs on it. Other than that, itappeared to be in perfect shape, he said.The mission was sponsored by Virgin Atlantic, a British airline foundedby Richard Branson. Branson greeted Fossett on Thursday with ahug and a bottle of champagne, which Branson began sprayingon Fossett. Fossett grabbed the bottle, sprayed his friend backand took a chug.Fossett holds world records in five sports, including ballooning and sailing.Branson has been his partner in some of them.In an interview with reporters near the GlobalFlyer, Fossett said thatthe fuel situation had concerned him, that but he hadrun into similar problems before.He said he liked ""things that are difficult to do"" andloved technology projects.""I would do these things if no one were paying attention,""he said.When asked what kind of contribution his feat had made tomankind, he said he wasn't sure it had made any.""I know Richard Branson doesn't agree with me. He thinks there'san important technological contribution in this,"" Fossett said. ""I thinkit's more in the lifestyle itself. I like going outand doing things that are interesting to me, and Ithink other people should do what is interesting to them.""The Global Flyer left Salina at 6:47 p.m. Monday. It weighed4,000 pounds and carried 18,100 pounds of fuel. On Wednesdaymorning, Mission Control directors announced that 2,600 pounds of fuelhad mysteriously disappeared. They said the fuel shortage put theworld record in jeopardy.By Wednesday evening, however, the directors were more optimistic. And, asit turned out, the GlobalFlyer appears to have had fuelto spare.When asked Thursday morning whether the fuel situation had been overplayedto gain publicity, Branson said the concern was real.""Incredibly, the thing is, in life truth is often stranger thanfiction,"" he said.NASA astronaut Ken Cockrell of Houston, whose last space mission wasin 2002, was intrigued enough by the mission to spendthe week in Salina. He was enthusiastic about it tothe end.""In every human heart there is a desire to explore,"" Cockrellsaid, as he waited on the runway Thursday for Fossettto touch down.""Some people like to explore things in a very small nicheof their environment. Others, like Steve, want to explore thingsno one else has ever done.""The Star's Laura Bauer contributed to this report.To reach Diane Carroll, call (816) 234-7704 or send e-mail todcarrollkcstar.com .
An audacious solo flight around the world -- the first withoutstops or refueling -- ended Thursday afternoon where it beganas the GlobalFlyer touched down safely, its 13 fuel tanksnearly empty.The plane, piloted by Steve Fossett, a 60-year-old investment executive andavid sailor, glider pilot and balloonist, covered about 23,000 mileson a zigzag course across the Atlantic, Africa, Asia andthe Pacific to ride the tailwinds, which sometimes blew at150 mph. It touched down shortly before 2 p.m. localtime on Thursday at a former Air Force base inSalina, Kan., 67 hours after it took off.The voyage, apparently the longest solo airplane flight in distance andtime, was also a test of human endurance. Fossett, whoemerged from his cramped cockpit through a small access hatchto the cheers of spectators and his ground crew, saidhe did not sleep at all for the first 24hours, had only a few catnaps for the rest ofthe trip, and subsisted on a dozen diet milkshakes.Fossett, who became the first to fly around the world soloin a balloon on his sixth attempt in 2002, saidon the runway in Salina that this solo flight was""a major ambition.""Richard Branson, the flamboyant Virgin Atlantic airline magnate who bankrolled theproject for an undisclosed sum, waved a giant checkered flag,and later doused Fossett in champagne.Before the trip Fossett called the mission ""highly interesting from atechnical standpoint."" On landing, he said, ""I had the goodfortune of getting the right people associated with it.""The plane consisted of a tiny fuselage flanked by twin boomsto hold the fuel, each with its own tail. Agliderlike wing, as long as the wing on a Boeing737, but lacking the flaps and slats that help pilotscontrol most long-distance planes, connected the cabin and the booms.The jet engine was attached to the top.The flight was a test of how fuel-efficient a plane couldbe and how much fuel it could carry. The 18,100pounds of fuel on takeoff Monday evening made up 82percent of the plane's weight.The builders nicknamed the plane the ""flying fuel tank."" One considerationin carrying so much fuel was that on landing, theplane was radically different from the one that took off.The GlobalFlyer departed to the east weighing as much asa 19-seat commuter plane, and approached from the west weighingless than a medium-sized sport utility vehicle, a difference thatposed substantial challenges because of changes in its handling characteristics.Fossett said early in the flight that it handled well, butwith only one pilot aboard, much of the flying wasdone by autopilot. He made the trip in a cigar-shapedcabin in a seat that resembled a recliner. He couldnot stand up.The GlobalFlyer was designed by Burt Rutan and built by Rutan'scompany, Scaled Composites, of Mojave, Calif.
","At 0400GMT March 2 over India a reading showed that just 9600 lbs. of fuel remained of the 19,000 lbs at takeoff. Mission control reported a fuel shortage: 2600 lbs. less than they had figured. Fossett decided to press on to Hawaii admitting the fuel problem was ""a huge setback."" Before reaching Hawaii he announced that he would continue on to Salina. By 0930GMT March 3 Global Flyer was southwest of California and that afternoon, after 67 hours in flight, Fossett glided into a perfect landing to the cheers of all of Salina and much of the world. ","On Wednesday after nearly 29 flight hours Steve Fossett reached his halfway point over India. While relying on autopilot, he could not ignore the complex demands of the aircraft for more than 10-20 minutes at a time. On Wednesday, while flying over mainland China mission control officials reported his fuel was 450 gallons less than expected. Fossett decided to fly to Hawaii to re-evaluate the situation. There he decided to proceed. The jet stream and great tailwinds over the Pacific allowed him to make up time. Fossett made a perfect landing in Salina Kansas after a 67-hour flight. ","Fossett reached the half-way point while flying over India and he also picked up a 100 MPH jet stream boost. While he was over China, mission control officials concluded that he had less fuel than they had counted on. Despite this, Fossett decided to press on to Hawaii. On the final legs of his flight, Fossett stayed awake by drinking a dozen chocolate protein milkshakes. Slightly over 67 hours after departure from Salina, Fossett landed the Global Flyer on the same airstrip from which he had departed. The plane had enough fuel remaining to fly another 10 hours. ","Steve Fossett continued his non-stop, solo flight, reaching the half-way point over Myanmar at 0705 GMT on Wednesday. Over China there was concern about the fuel supply, but he decided to continue to Hawaii and at 2000 was east of Japan. As he was north of Hawaii, he again decided to continue because the jet stream was so strong. By 0930 on Thursday, he was 1,151 miles southwest of California. He landed at Salina, Kansas, at 1948 GMT. He had taken just over 67 hours to fly a 23,000 mile zigzag course around the world."
D0927,D0927-A,"Peter Jennings revealed that he is suffering from lung cancer and plans tocontinue on ""World News Tonight"" as much as possible after beginningchemotherapy next week.Jennings, ABC's chief anchorman since 1983, was replaced by Elizabeth Vargas onTuesday but taped a message telling viewers about his diagnosis.""I will continue to do the broadcast,"" he said. ""On good days, my voice will notalways be like this. Certainly, it's been a long time. And I hope it goeswithout saying that a journalist who doesn't value _ deeply _ the audience'sloyalty should be in another line of work.""A former smoker who quit 20 years ago, Jennings resumed smoking briefly afterthe Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The 66-year-old anchor was too ill towork Saturday during the network's special report on Pope John Paul II's death.He hasn't been feeling well the past few months, and didn't travel underdoctor's orders after December's tsunami because of what was described then asan upper respiratory infection. He did go to Iraq in January for theelections.Jennings said he was surprised at how fast the news traveled and at the kindnesshe had received from so many people.""Finally,"" he said, ""I wonder if other men and women ask their doctors rightaway: `OK, doc, when does the hair go?""Lung cancer is the leading cancer killer in the United States, and roughly fourout of five people diagnosed with the disease die within five years, said Dr.Cliff Connery, chief of thoracic surgery at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital inManhattan.Doctors said most lung cancer patients can continue to work throughouttreatment, but need flexibility to take it easy on days they are not feelingwell.With his very visible position on television each night, Jennings could be aninspiration for many others going through a similar fight, said Dr. DavidJohnson, chief of oncology and hematology at the Vanderbilt University School ofMedicine.""I think it sets the right example,"" Johnson said. ""I think it says youshouldn't stop your life if you have cancer. It may take your life, but youshouldn't let it control your life.""There are effective ways to treat lung cancer, but its mortality rate is so highbecause so many patients aren't diagnosed until their disease is in an advancedstage, Connery said.Charles Gibson, Vargas and others will substitute for Jennings from time totime, said ABC News President David Westin. Gibson is in Rome for coverage ofthe pope's funeral, an assignment that Jennings, a former Rome and Londoncorrespondent for ABC News, normally would have taken.""He's already bringing to this new challenge the courage and strength we've seenso often in his reporting from the field and in anchoring ABC News,"" Westin toldABC staffers. ""I know that all of us will give him every bit of support that heneeds and asks for.""Jennings is the last of the anchor troika that dominated U.S. broadcast networknews divisions over the last two decades. NBC's Tom Brokaw stepped down lastyear and CBS' Dan Rather left last month.""Peter is an old friend,"" Brokaw said Tuesday. ""I'm heartbroken, but he's also atough guy. I'm counting on him getting through this very difficultpassage.""While still in his 20s, Jennings anchored ABC's evening news for two years inthe 1960s. He returned to the desk in 1978 when third-place ABC tried amulti-anchor format, which was abandoned in 1983 when Frank Reynolds died fromcancer. Jennings has been ABC's sole evening anchor ever since.A Canadian who proudly became a U.S. citizen in 2003, the urbane Jenningsdominated the ratings from the late 1980s to the mid-'90s, when Brokaw surpassedhim.""Jennings has served American broadcast news with a graceful internationalistintelligence,"" said Rich Hanley, director of graduate programs at QuinnipiacUniversity's school of communications. ""His manner of news delivery stood incontrast to but not in opposition of the gentle Midwestern aesthetic expressedby Tom Brokaw and the don't-mess-with-Texas eccentricity of DanRather.""
Peter Jennings, the last of the three long-dominantnetwork anchors still on the job, said Tuesday he has been diagnosedwith lung cancer.Jennings, 66, plans to begin chemotherapy and to continue to anchorABC's ``World News Tonight'' when he can, but specialists said thedecision to forgo surgery suggests a more advanced form of cancer forwhich long-term survival rates are relatively low.Jennings had planned to anchor Tuesday night's newscast, butdecided an hour before airtime that his voice was too weak. In avideotaped message, he disclosed the diagnosis in a raspy voice,saying, ``Yes, I was a smoker until about 20 years ago, and I was weakand smoked over 9/11. But whatever the reason, the news does slow youdown a bit. ... The National Cancer Institute says that we aresurvivors from the moment of diagnosis. I will continue to do thebroadcast; on good days my voice will not always be like this.''After a four-month period in which Tom Brokaw retired at NBC, DanRather relinquished the anchor chair at CBS and Ted Koppel said he wasleaving ABC, Jennings's illness underscored the generational shiftunderway at the broadcast networks. They have been losing audienceshare for two decades but still reach 30 million people with theirevening newscasts.Jennings has been the face of ABC News for much of his 40-yearcareer there, first as anchor from 1965 to 1968, in what he hasdescribed as an unsuccessful tenure, then as part of a three-mananchor team in 1978 before becoming solo anchor again in 1983.Since Brokaw's departure in December, Jennings has brought hisnewscast close to the top-rated ``NBC Nightly News'' in the Nielsens.ABC anticipated Brokaw's resignation by kicking off a promotionalcampaign for Jennings with the tag line: ``Trust is earned.''ABC News President David Westin said in a note to the staff that``Peter's been given a tough assignment. He's already bringing to thisnew challenge the courage and strength we've seen so often in hisreporting from the field and in anchoring ABC News.'' Westin saidCharlie Gibson, Elizabeth Vargas and others would fill in for Jenningswhen necessary. Vargas got the last-minute call Tuesday night.ABC executives refused to provide medical details of the type orstate of Jennings's cancer. Nine in 10 lung cancer cases are relatedto smoking, and a diminishing risk continues even after someone quits.Norman Edelman, chief medical officer of the American LungAssociation, said a decision by patients not to seek surgery for lungcancer ``suggests they believe it's already spread to a point wheresurgery does not offer a cure.'' This is either because the cancer isat too advanced a stage or because it is a form called small-cellcancer -- which occurs in about a quarter of such cases -- and hasalready spread to other parts of the body, he said. Still,``chemotherapy can absolutely prolong life,'' said Edelman, whoteaches at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.Michael Thun, vice president of epidemiology for the AmericanCancer Society, said that ``the most effective treatment for localizedlung cancer is surgical removal. If it's already spread, then surgeryis not an option.'' Although the five-year survival rate for men withoperable lung cancer is 45 percent, he said, it is under 14 percentfor more advanced cancer that cannot be removed.Jennings, who had not been feeling well for months, got thediagnosis Monday afternoon and told his staff that night. Some in theindustry had been sniping at him for not going to Asia to cover thetsunami and not anchoring coverage of the pope's final hours Fridayand Saturday or heading off to Rome.``Peter has always been healthy as a horse and shows up foreverything,'' said an ABC staffer who requested anonymity becausenetwork employees have been asked not to comment. ``For Peter not tobe there for the pope truly did leave everyone saying there must besomething terribly wrong.'' But, the staffer added, ``this is a manwho will have no time and no patience for pity.''In a note to his staff, Jennings wrote, ``Almost 10 millionAmericans are living with cancer. I am sure I will learn from them howto cope with the facts of life that none of us anticipated.'' Headded: ``There will be good days and bad, which means that some days Imay be cranky and some days really cranky!''Jennings added a similarly light note on Tuesday night's broadcast,smiling several times and noting that he was ``a little surprised atthe kindness today from so many people. ... I wonder if other men andwomen ask their doctors right away, `OK, Doc, when does the hairgo?'''Jennings, Rather and Brokaw once dominated the media landscape, toa degree unimaginable today, because beginning in the early 1980s theyreached about half the television audience, unchallenged by cable news-- then in its infancy -- or talk radio or the Internet.By the time newer and faster technological rivals, includingbloggers who often criticized them, came on the scene, the Big Threeanchors were well-established figures from having chronicled so manynational and global stories, from war to impeachment to terrorism. Ayounger generation of anchors mostly lacks that depth of experience --Jennings as a Middle East-based correspondent for seven years, Ratheras a White House correspondent and ``60 Minutes'' contributor, Brokawas a White House reporter and ``Today'' host.NBC planned best for the inevitable succession, anointing BrianWilliams, 45, who has held onto the ratings lead, 21/2 years before hetook over in December. CBS had no replacement ready when Rather, underpressure from his botching of the story about President Bush'smilitary service, stepped down last month, although Bob Schieffer, 68,has won praise as interim anchor for his more conversational style.ABC, despite a stable of high-priced stars like Koppel and BarbaraWalters, never groomed an obvious young successor to Jennings. And theevening news franchise itself, less lucrative than the popular morningshows, is often derided as an anachronism with an aging core of loyalviewers. ``Good Morning America'' co-host Diane Sawyer, as well asGibson, would be part of any shortlist, but both seem happy with theircurrent situations. Vargas is viewed as a rising star within thenetwork. Koppel, who plans to leave ABC in December over plans to make``Nightline'' a live, hour-long broadcast, has filled in for Jenningsbut never expressed interest in being a permanent evening anchor.The son of a Canadian broadcaster, Jennings got dual U.S.citizenship after the 2001 terrorist attacks. He was the courtliest ofthe Big Three anchors, the most frequently married -- four times -- andthe least self-promotional. He often described himself as a terribleinterview.Alex Jones, director of Harvard's Shorenstein media center, saidthat when he interviewed Jennings two decades ago, ``he wasembarrassed that he had not finished high school and worked all theharder to be a superb journalist. This was always a man who had a moregraceful humor and air of sophistication, which came from his days asa foreign correspondent when he looked like something from a 1940smovie, handsome and dashing.'' Because of his limited education, Jonessaid, ``he took that spot as anchor with some trepidation.''Such was Jennings' longevity that he was in Germany when the BerlinWall went up and when it came down. Jennings was the first toestablish a television bureau in the Middle East and one of threewestern journalists to witness Saddam Hussein's first appearance in anIraqi court last year. The winner of 14 Emmy Awards, he has reportedfrom all 50 states and hosted specials such as ``Peter JenningsReporting,'' ``The Search for Jesus,'' ``The Kennedy Assassination --Beyond Conspiracy'' and, more recently, one on UFOs. He also anchoredthe New Year's Eve broadcast at the turn of the millennium that won aPeabody Award.``Peter is part of the DNA of ABC News,'' said spokesman JeffreySchneider. ``He's very strong and he's a fighter. Obviously this is anemotional day here. Everyone's first, second and third thoughts arefor Peter's speedy recovery.''
ABC News anchor Peter Jennings has been diagnosed withlung cancer, the network announced Tuesday, and will immediately begina round of outpatient chemotherapy that is expected to keep him fromthe anchor desk at times in the coming months.The 66-year-old newsman, who smoked when he was younger, had beenfeeling ill during the last several days and was diagnosed Mondayafternoon. He broke the news to his senior staff at ``World NewsTonight'' in an e-mail Tuesday morning, saying he hoped to continue toanchor throughout his treatment.``There will be good days and bad, which means that some days I maybe cranky and some days really cranky!'' he wrote. ``Almost 10 millionAmericans are living with cancer. I am sure I will learn from them howto cope with the facts of life that none of us anticipated.''Jennings' announcement provoked sadness and dismay among hiscolleagues at ABC, where the anchor plays a central role in leadingthe news division. His illness may sideline, at least temporarily, oneof the last remaining lions of network news, coming on the heels ofthe departures of NBC anchor Tom Brokaw and CBS anchor Dan Rather fromtheir evening newscasts. Another television veteran, Ted Koppel,announced last week that he was leaving ABC and ``Nightline'' at theend of the year. Jennings, who has anchored ``World News Tonight''since 1983, led the newscast Friday and is expected to do so againtonight. He begins treatment in New York next week. A networkspokeswoman declined to identify the location, citing his privacy.ABC News President David Westin told the network's staff that heand Jennings expect the anchor to continue the newscast during histreatment ``to the extent he can do so comfortably.''``But we should also expect him to be off the broadcast from timeto time, depending on how he feels,'' Westin wrote in an e-mail to theentire staff, adding that Charlie Gibson and Elizabeth Vargas, amongothers, would substitute for Jennings.``Peter's been given a tough assignment,'' Westin added. ``He'salready bringing to this new challenge the courage and strength we'veseen so often in his reporting from the field and in anchoring ABCNews. I know that all of us will give him every bit of support that heneeds and asks for. Peter will once again lead the way, but we willstand with him at every turn.''Jennings called the diagnosis ``quite a surprise'' and expressedgratitude for his colleagues.``In all the years I have worked here I have had the mostoutstanding support from this news division,'' he wrote. ``Hundreds ofyou have been like family. It feels good to have such a family rightnow.''Jennings did not go to Rome to cover Pope John Paul II's death. Andhe stayed back from Asia after the disastrous tsunami in December. Atthe time, ABC said Jennings had a severe upper respiratory infection,and the network sent Diane Sawyer.Jennings joined ABC News in 1964. Jennings has won 14 nationalEmmys, several Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University awards, severalOverseas Press Club awards and a George Foster Peabody award.Times staff writers Scott Collins and Mary MacVean contributed tothis report.
Anchorman: The very word suggests security and gravitas. Seriousbut sympathetic, the timbre of his voice is a firm tenor or astentorian baritone, perhaps a bit tense in dire straits, but neverpanicky. Closing out the night watch, his signature sign-off soundslike a benediction. ``Good night and good luck,'' said Edward R.Murrow. ``And that's the way it is,'' asserted the decisive WalterCronkite.The future of the iconic American anchorman was on the minds ofmany this week as the news that Peter Jennings had been diagnosed withlung cancer raised concerns that he wouldn't be able to continue asanchor at ABC News.After the long goodbye of NBC's Tom Brokaw (who served from 1983until December), and the forced retirement of CBS' besieged Dan Rather(in harness from 1981 until March), the departure of the 66-year-oldJennings (sole anchor since 1978) would complete a clean sweep of thevenerable troika from the erstwhile Big Three. Even more significant,it would mark the end of a special kind of personality-driven newsexperience -- the last unique legacy (reruns not included) of theclassic age of broadcast television.The anchor's roots reach back to the birth of modern broadcastjournalism in 1938, when CBS Radio launched its ``World News Roundup''just in time to track Hitler marauding across Europe. The declamatorystyle of the town-crier announcer (familiar as the so-called Voice ofGod in the Hollywood newsreels) soon gave way to a new reportorialmodel in which the journalist became a commentator as well, guidingthe listener through strange doings and complex geopolitics.Murrow, of course, was the prototype for this new breed ofbroadcast journalist. When he moved from radio to TV, his visiblepresence only intensified the emotional link: the movie star looks,the patrician manner, the cigarette smoke swirling around his headlike incense. On March 9, 1954, when Murrow delivered a slashingbroadside at Sen. Joseph McCarthy, he was cashing in a lifetime ofmoral capital accrued from Munich to Panmunjom.As an anchor, Murrow was a bit of a bust, but another candidate waswaiting in the wings. During the TV coverage of the 1952 presidentialconventions, CBS News President Sig Mickelson coined the term``anchorman'' for his primary on-air reporter. The man Mickelsonpicked was Walter Cronkite.Cronkite had to wait until 1962 before taking the reins of ``TheCBS Evening News'' away from Douglas Edwards, but 1963 was hisbreakout year. That September, first CBS and then NBC expanded theirnews broadcasts from 15 minutes to 30. Then, over a vertiginous fourdays that November, the Kennedy assassination sent millions ofAmericans to the anchor to calm their nerves and soothe their souls.Cronkite's iconic bearing of the bad news (``From Dallas, Texas, aflash, apparently official. ...'') has long since become audiovisualshorthand for the moment of impact: pulling off his glasses, chokingup, stoically going forward.Like Murrow, Cronkite spent his capital carefully, trading on hischeerleading for NASA to cover his flanks when he turned against theVietnam War after the 1968 Tet offensive. The anchor was alwayscareful not to run too far ahead of his Nielsen demographic -- maybe afew feet ahead of the fashion curve, but never out on the cuttingedge.It was around this time that Cronkite earned his sobriquet as ``themost trusted man in America,'' not as impressive as it sounds giventhe competition.In 1981, the same year that Rather edged out the eminence gris, amore significant milestone in the annals of anchordom appeared onscreen: CNN, the beginning of 24-hour news and the end of thenetworks' monopoly.By the 1990s, from the Gulf War through O.J.-TV to the massacre atColumbine High School, a multiplicity of news options and a dizzyingcast of faces were available to bear the bad tidings.The dinnertime newscast -- once de rigueur from coast to coast --became a missable feast for Americans who had been munching all day oncable and the Internet. (From their high-water mark in the late 1960s,ratings for the network newscasts have plummeted by 60 percent.)Tellingly, the most traumatic day in U.S. broadcasting history --9/11 -- bequeathed no equivalent to Cronkite's JFK moment: The imagesof disaster are indelible, but no face, gesture or remark from asingle newscaster stands out.Over the years, American anchormen derived their authoritativeprofile less from anything they did than from the simple fact ofprolonged exposure, repeated ceremonially for years, in a hegemonicmedia environment. In this sense, it is hard to lament the transfer ofpower from the great and powerful men in front of the curtain to everymunchkin with a modem. Yet it also is hard not to get a littlesentimental over the end of a tradition that well-served the news,and, on occasion, the nation.
The first message was posted just six minutes after thenews broke April 5 that ABC anchor Peter Jennings had been diagnosedwith lung cancer. By the end of the week, more than 3,400 e-mailsoffering him prayers and good wishes had filled the network's onlinemessage board -- many of them expressing an intensely personal senseof grief.``Our old and trusted friend, you have looked out for all of us forso long, and comforted us in our time of need,'' wrote Peggi and RonBarratt. ``Please take the time to now look out for yourself.''While the announcement of Jennings' illness hit the alreadyunsettled world of network news with even more turbulence, it alsojolted television viewers, stripping them -- at least for a time -- ofthe last of the three familiar faces that had anchored the eveningnews for the past two decades.Jennings still hopes to lead the newscast throughout hischemotherapy. But he was unable to deliver the news last week becauseof a hoarse voice, and it remains unclear how frequently he will be onthe air.Viewer reaction to his illness underscored the challenge facing thenetworks as they usher in a new generation of evening news anchors:replicating the strong bonds that have developed between audiences andthe iconic faces of ABC, NBC and CBS.``The illusion that television has created is that we experienceevents, and the people that bring us through, that are our guides, arethe network anchors,'' said Gary Edgerton, a professor at Old DominionUniversity in Norfolk, Va., and co-editor of the Journal of PopularFilm and Television. ``We have these really intense, interpersonalconnections with these stars.''NBC eased the transition from Tom Brokaw to Brian Williams inDecember by announcing the move two years ahead of time and givingviewers ample opportunities to watch Williams as a substitute anchor.CBS tapped a veteran newsman, Bob Schieffer, to temporarily replaceDan Rather when he left the newscast last month.Jennings' diagnosis forces ABC executives to begin contemplatingthe question of succession, too -- a matter most had assumed would beat least several years off.``It signals the transition that ABC inevitably is going to have tomake,'' said Charles Bierbauer, a former CNN and ABC correspondent whoserves as dean of the University of South Carolina's College of MassCommunications and Information Studies. ``The simple fact is that thegeneration is changing.''But transferring viewer affection to new anchors is not a simplematter, media experts said.``These are the type of interactions that have to be developed overtime,'' said Jeffrey McCall, a professor of communications at DepauwUniversity in Greencastle, Ind., who noted that competitive pressuresfrom all-news cable channels, the Internet and other news sourceslimit the amount of time new anchors have to bond with theiraudiences.``Network news is in a big pickle,'' he said. ``They can't affordto let whoever takes over the time to grow into the role.''Some executives actually view the turnover as an opportunity toradically remake the broadcasts in hopes of appealing to a youngerdemographic.CBS Chairman and Chief Executive Leslie Moonves has called thetraditional ``voice of God'' anchor an antiquated concept andsuggested that his network may roll out a more irreverent,multi-anchor format.``Those days are over where you have that guy sitting behind thedesk that everybody believes to the nth degree,'' he told reporters inJanuary.But TV news correspondent and anchor Morton Dean dismissed the ideathat audiences no longer seek that kind of relationship. ``I thinkit's a mistake for anybody to think anchors are no longer as importantas they once were, because when there's a crisis in America, oraffecting America, people turn to someone they trust,'' said Dean, whoworked at CBS and ABC. The audience for the three major eveningnewscasts has shrunk considerably amid growing competition, yet theystill combine to attract upward of 26 million people each weeknight.Indeed, there was ample evidence last week that viewers greatlyvalue the intimacy and confidence they have felt with Jennings, whohas anchored ``World News Tonight'' for 22 years. ABC's Web site wasflooded with emotional testimonials from people about his effect ontheir lives, many referring to him as a member of the family.An Ohio mother said she and her children say, ``Good night, Peter''every night after the newscast. A college student wrote that she nevermisses his broadcasts and that she used to watch it nightly with herfather.Viewer after viewer cited Jennings' handling of coverage of theSept. 11 attacks as a welcome balm during a horrific day. Asecond-grade teacher from Wilmington, N. C., said Jennings' demeanor``gave your viewers a sense of peace, that everything would eventuallybe better than it was at that moment'' and helped ``explain theunexplainable to our children.'' A Cincinnati viewer wrote that ``whenthe nation circles its wagons, you are the wagon master that providesus with a sense of calm.''``Life won't be the same till you're back in the living rooms ofAmerica every night,'' wrote a woman identified as Marilyn L.Stuart Fischoff, a professor emeritus of media psychology atCalifornia State University, Los Angeles, said he is not surprised bythe emotional responses to Jennings' absence from the newscast lastweek.``There is research that shows when you remove pivotal people ontelevision from a person's daily life, they feel like they've had adeath in the family,'' he said. ``They feel rootless.''ABC executives stress that Jennings is still the anchor of ``WorldNews Tonight'' and will do the broadcast whenever he feels up to it.When he can't, he still plans to exert a strong force in shaping thenewscast.``We are enormously grateful for the loyalty of our audience, andwe expect they will continue to get their news from Peter Jennings,''ABC News spokesman Jeffrey Schneider said. ``Nights when they don'tsee him physically on the air, they know his steady hand is on thetiller.''Schneider insisted that ABC executives are focused on Jennings'recovery. But TV news veterans said the network must consider who willtake over if Jennings is unable to continue.Charles Gibson, co-host of ``Good Morning America,'' and ``20/20''co-anchor Elizabeth Vargas, who are filling in for Jenningstemporarily, are considered possible permanent replacements for thelongtime anchor, along with ``World News Tonight Saturday'' anchor BobWoodruff and chief White House correspondent Terry Moran.But Robert Zelnick, chairman of Boston University's Department ofJournalism and a former ABC News correspondent, said it would be hardto find an adequate replacement. ``This is a body blow to ABC and toaficionados of evening news,'' he said. ``I've been walking around fordays feeling a lump of sadness. He's been such a big part of ourlives.''
Peter Jennings, in a statement read Friday night on ABC's ``WorldNews Tonight,'' shared with viewers his feelings about his battle withlung cancer and expressed gratitude for the support he has receivedfrom fans and friends. The 66-year-old anchorman had announced onApril 6 that he was diagnosed with the disease and shortly thereafterbegan treatment.``Thousands of you have spoiled me rotten with your attention inthe last couple of weeks,'' Jennings said in a statement that was readon air by Elizabeth Vargas. ``So many experiences have meant somethingspecial. A woman in my building who is a cancer survivor showed up atmy front door so that we could see that bald really is beautiful.She's right.''By allowing his feelings to be expressed on air, Jennings gaveviewers an unusually personal glimpse of what it is like to have thedisease as well as offering what may be solace to cancer patients,support group leaders said.``What we see in Peter Jennings is a role model,'' said SuzanneBrace, executive director of HopeWell Cancer Support in Lutherville,Md. ``Whenever someone like that goes public, it gives otherspermission to talk about their cancers. It also offers encouragementand courage. People think, `If he can go public with his employersabout his cancer, maybe I can, too.' ''Jennings offered a further update on his treatment Friday in aletter posted on the abcnews.com Web site.``Yesterday, I decided to go to the office; I live only a fewblocks away. I got as far as the bedroom door. Chemo strikes,''Jennings wrote. ``Do I detect a knowing but sympathetic smile on manyof your faces? You knew this was coming.''Jennings went on to describe notes and messages he had receivedfrom Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Hamilton Jordan, former chief ofstaff in the administration of President Carter.In a note, Specter told the anchorman, ``the only way to getthrough chemo is to work your way through it.''``He's a tougher man than I am,'' Jennings said.Jordan sent Jennings a book titled ``No Such Thing as a Bad Day.''``He's had cancer four times. He tells me, as have many others, thatwhen it gets really bad, it will get better. Whew!'' Jennings added.``I won't soon forget an encounter as I was leaving the hospital. Amiddle-aged couple was going into the building and as they passed me,I heard my name and turned. The woman stepped right in my face andsaid, `Me too. Lung cancer.' Instinctively, immediately, we gave eachother a hug -- a real hug -- and went on our respective ways knowingthat we had been strengthened by the connection.''That kind of testimony from a public figure like Jennings can makea ``huge difference'' in peoples' lives, Brace said last night afterhearing Jennings' remarks on the newscast.``I was thinking back to when Betty Ford first went public with herbreast cancer, and what a difference that made,'' Brace said. ``Thisdoes give people a way to say, `Me too.' ''Jennings has not anchored the newscast since April 1. Vargas andCharles Gibson, co-host of ``Good Morning America,'' have substitutedfor him.
""World News Tonight"" anchor Peter Jennings has lung cancer,ABC announced Tuesday, but plans to remain on the jobthroughout his treatment.He and ABC News President David Westin sent e-mails to theirnewsroom colleagues about the diagnosis, which Jennings received Monday. Westincalled the news ""a tough assignment,"" while Jennings, 66, saidit was ""quite a surprise.""A former smoker who quit some years ago, Jennings will beginoutpatient chemotherapy treatment next week in New York, but heintends to continue broadcasting as his health permits.In his e-mail, Westin wrote, ""It's both Peter's and my expectationthat he will anchor 'World News Tonight' during the periodof treatment to the extent he can do so comfortably;but, we should also expect him to be off thebroadcast from time to time, depending on how he feels.""Charles Gibson, Elizabeth Vargas and others will substitute for Jennings asnecessary.Jennings wrote of his coming treatment: ""There will be good daysand bad, which means that some days I may becranky and some days really cranky!""Almost 10 million Americans are living with cancer. I am sureI will learn from them how to cope with thefacts of life that none of us anticipated.""The news comes at a time when Jennings remains virtually thelast of the longtime network anchors. NBC's Tom Brokaw signedoff in December. Dan Rather left his desk at CBSa month ago. Last week, Jennings' ABC colleague Ted Koppelannounced he will leave ""Nightline"" this December.Once the main source of news for TV watchers, these networkanchors have lost viewers over the past decade because ofthe proliferation of alternate news resources on cable TV andthe Internet. In Rather's absence, CBS executives have discussed experimentingwith the time-honored ""voice-of-God,"" single-anchor format.""This will probably be a momentous year for network news,"" saysMichael Castengera, a lecturer at the University of Georgia's GradyCollege of Journalism and an independent media consultant. ""As thestruggle continues to win viewers, people at very high levelsat the networks are going to have to make sometough decisions.""As a coach for aspiring broadcasters, Castengera has told his studentsto watch Jennings' broadcasts, ""because he has such a relaxed,personable style that makes him very easy to relate to,""he says. ""Peter Jennings is one of the few anchorsthat people almost invariably say, 'Yes, I could see sittingdown and having a drink with him and talking casuallyabout issues.' ""Jennings joined ABC News in 1964 and served as the anchorof ""ABC Evening News"" from 1965 to 1968. He wasforeign desk anchor for ""World News Tonight"" from 1978 to1983, the year he was named the program's anchor andsenior editor. Born in Toronto, he became a U.S. citizenin 2003.Steve Murray writes for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. E-mail: stmurray@ajc.com
Peter Jennings, the last of the three major anchors of hisera who is still working on a nightly newscast, revealedTuesday that he has lung cancer and that he willbegin chemotherapy next week.E-mail messages released Tuesday by Jennings and ABC News president DavidWestin stressed that Jennings, who is 66 and who hasanchored ABC's ""World News Tonight"" since 1983, will continue towork during treatment, provided he feels well enough. Jennings decidedlate Tuesday not to anchor Tuesday night's program and wasreplaced by ""20/20"" coanchor Elizabeth Vargas.The dramatic news - which comes on the heels of lastweek's announcement that ""Nightline"" host Ted Koppel will leave atyear's end and which follows the recent departures of CBSand NBC anchors Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw - reinforcesthe idea that a chapter in television journalism is comingto an end.""Your initial reaction is you wish Peter Jennings well,"" said J.Max Robins, editor in chief at Broadcasting & Cable magazine.""You really wonder, if given this kind of narrowcasting environment,we'll ever see people of this iconic stature again inthe news business.""The health of Jennings, a former smoker, surfaced as an issuelate last year, when he was unable to travel abroadfor coverage of the devastating tsunami in southern and SoutheastAsia. At the time, ABC insiders thought he was battlinga lingering flu or a similar ailment. The announcement Tuesdayseemed to stun the network.""Obviously this is a very emotional day at ABC News,"" saida spokesman, Jeffrey Schneider. ""Everybody is rallying around Peter, andwe are here to help him get through this andbeat this.""He added: ""We expect him to be the anchor for manyyears to come.""NBC completed a lengthy and smoothly choreographed transition in December whenBrian Williams succeeded Brokaw in the anchor chair. At CBS,Rather's announcement last November that he would step down, whichfollowed a furor over the flawed ""60 Minutes Wednesday"" reporton President Bush's military record, left that network scrambling fora successor. Veteran correspondent Bob Schieffer was picked to fillthe slot on an interim basis when Rather departed lastmonth.ABC's ""World News Tonight"" is currently in second place in thenightly news wars, but it has been breathing down theneck of the ratings leader, ""NBC Nightly News."" (For theweek that ended April 1, ABC's newscast averaged almost 9.5million viewers, compared with 10 million for NBC.) Until now,there has not been much public discussion about an eventualsuccessor to Jennings, who has worked at ABC News since1964. Schneider said the diagnosis has not caused the networkto focus more intently on the Jennings succession.In his e-mail to the staff, Westin said that when Jenningsis unable to work, Vargas and ""Good Morning America"" cohostCharles Gibson would be among the substitutes. Others likely tofill in include chief White House correspondent Terry Moran andnetwork correspondent Bob Woodruff.While making Jennings's condition public, the network did not provide detailsabout the diagnosis or prognosis. Westin wrote that the anchorwould undergo outpatient treatment in New York and that ""weshould also expect him to be off the broadcast fromtime to time.""In his own e-mail to his colleagues, Jennings said: ""There willbe good days and bad, which means that some daysI may be cranky and some days really cranky!""Almost 10 million Americans are living with cancer. I am sureI will learn from them how to cope with thefacts of life that none of us anticipated.""Dr. Scott Swanson, a thoracic surgeon at New York's Mount SinaiMedical Center who specializes in lung cancer, said of Jennings:""He seems pretty healthy now. In terms of the chemotherapystopping him, most people do work through chemotherapy.""""Lung cancer in general is aggressive,"" Swanson added. ""Overall, we're stillhaving a hard time with it, mainly because we're notfinding it in an early phase.""
Peter Jennings, the sole anchor of the ABC evening newscast forthe past 22 years, announced Tuesday that he was sufferingfrom lung cancer and had begun treatment.ABC said Jennings, 66, would work as often as he couldduring his course of treatment. But the network, which hasseen the recent replacement of anchors at NBC and CBSas an opportunity for Jennings to vault into the ratingsleadership, is planning to use substitute anchors, including Charles Gibsonand Elizabeth Vargas, in his absence.Jennings was unable to anchor the ABC newscast on Tuesday night,though he had originally planned to. He did tape abrief commentary to close the newscast, speaking in a hoarseand strained voice.He said: ""The National Cancer Institute says that we are survivorsfrom the moment of diagnosis. I will continue to dothe broadcast. On good days, my voice will not alwaysbe like this. Certainly, it's been a long time. AndI hope it goes without saying that a journalist whodoesn't value -- deeply -- the audience's loyalty should bein another line of work.""ABC News emphasized that Jennings would remain its evening news anchor.In an e-mail message to his staff on Tuesday, DavidWestin, the president of ABC News, praised Jennings for hisleadership of the news division over the years and expressedthe division's support as he encountered this challenge. ""Peter willonce again lead the way but we will stand withhim at every turn,"" Westin said.He added that Jennings would undergo outpatient treatment in New Yorkand would continue to work on the newscast ""to theextent he can do so comfortably.""Jennings had been a heavy smoker until the mid- to late-1980s,colleagues said. He quit at that time, though the colleaguessaid it was an enormous struggle for him and periodicallyhe was known to sneak a cigarette or two. Atone point, Jennings and his executive producer then, Paul Friedman,visited a hypnotist in Boston seeking to break their addictionsto cigarettes.That treatment worked for a time, but as Jennings acknowledged inhis commentary on Tuesday night, he returned to regular smokingafter the terrorist attacks in 2001. He later quit again,a colleague said.Lung cancer is usually difficult to treat. While the prognosis dependson the type of lung cancer, the overall cure rateis just 16 percent. Sixty percent of lung cancer patientsdie within a year of diagnosis, and nearly 75 percentdie within two years.
The news that Peter Jennings will be absent from ""World NewsTonight"" for an indeterminate period while he is being treatedfor lung cancer has, at least from a business perspective,had its most profound impact on Jennings' ultimate boss, DavidWestin, the president of ABC News.In the short run, the absence of Jennings threatens to undermineone of the chief goals Westin has set for hisnews division this year: to overtake its main rival, ""NBCNightly News,"" at a moment of potential vulnerability for NBC-- just as Brian Williams has lost some of theaudience he inherited in December from Tom Brokaw.Westin faces a far bigger dilemma in the long run. Withestimated annual advertising revenue of more than $100 million, ""WorldNews Tonight"" is big business for ABC. If Westin continuesto simply patch together a lineup of substitute anchors whilewaiting for Jennings to recover his health, the network couldsquander the momentum it has already generated. But if ABCNews makes any long-term strategic or personnel moves, including groominga successor for the anchor chair, it could appear tobe preparing for a future without Jennings, who, at 66,maybe the news network's biggest star.Even as he began treatment last week as an outpatient, Jenningsremained a presence on ""World News Tonight,"" albeit backstage. Hewas in regular e-mail contact with Westin; Jonathan Banner, theprogram's executive producer; and others, going so far as tocomment on scripts for upcoming shows. One morning last week,he even participated via conference call in the program's 9a.m. editorial meeting, his voice hoarse but strong.Jennings has also been encouraged by Westin and Banner to comein and reclaim the anchor chair on any night hefeels up to it, with as little as 45 minutes'notice. ""He's e-mailing; he's suggesting stories,"" Banner said. ""Quite frankly,I think some of my colleagues might be surprised athow he's getting involved in scripts.""On March 31, less than a week before Jennings disclosed hiscancer, Westin announced that Ted Koppel would be leaving ""Nightline""and the network in December.""It's a very dynamic time at ABC News,"" said Paul Slavin,a senior vice president in the division. ""There is aconstant stream of big decisions coming down the road.""
","Peter Jennings's announcement April 5, 2005, that he had lung cancer left his colleagues at ABC News saddened and dismayed. He had been ""World News Tonight"" anchorman since 1983. By the end of the week, ABC had received 3,400 e-mails offering him prayers and good wishes.

D0927,D0927-B,"Peter Jennings, the suave, Canadian-born broadcaster who delivered the news toAmericans each night in five separate decades, died at age 67.Jennings, who announced in April that he had lung cancer, died Sunday at his NewYork home, ABC News President David Westin said in a statement.""Peter has been our colleague, our friend, and our leader in so many ways,""Westin said. ""None of us will be the same without him.""With Tom Brokaw and Dan Rather, Jennings was part of a triumvirate thatdominated network news for more than two decades, through the birth of cablenews and the Internet. His smooth delivery and years of international reportingmade him particularly popular among urban dwellers.""Peter was born to be an anchor,"" Brokaw said Monday on NBC's ""Today."" He saidhe met Jennings in 1966 covering Ronald Reagan's campaign for Californiagovernor and ""we had an instant friendship.""Rather, appearing on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" tribute to Jennings, notedthat beneath Jennings' polished exterior was a fierce competitor.""If Peter was in the area code, I didn't sleep,"" Rather said.Jennings dominated the ratings from the late 1980s to the mid-'90s, when Brokawsurpassed him. He remained a Canadian until 2003, when he became a U.S. citizen,saying it had nothing to do with his politics _ he did it for hisfamily.""He was a warm and loving and surprisingly sentimental man,"" said fellow ABCanchor Ted Koppel.Jennings deeply regretted dropping out of high school, and he would have wantedthat lesson passed along, Koppel said. He made up for it by becoming a studentof the world, studying cultures and their people for the rest of hislife.""No one could ad lib like Peter,"" said Barbara Walters. ""Sometimes he drove mecrazy because he knew every detail. ... He just died much tooyoung.""Jennings was wherever the big story was. He logged more than 60 hours on the airduring the week of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, offering a soothingsense of continuity during a troubled time.""There are a lot of people who think our job is to reassure the public everynight that their home, their community and their nation is safe,"" he told authorJeff Alan. ""I don't subscribe to that at all. I subscribe to leaving people withessentially _ sorry it's a cliche _ a rough draft of history. Some days it'sreassuring, some days it's absolutely destructive.""Jennings' announcement four months ago that the longtime smoker would begintreatment for lung cancer came as a shock.""I will continue to do the broadcast,"" he said, his voice husky, in a tapedmessage that night. ""On good days, my voice will not always be likethis.""Although Jennings occasionally came to the office between chemotherapytreatments, he never again appeared on air.Broadcasting was the family business for Jennings. His father, Charles Jennings,was the first person to anchor a nightly national news program in Canada andlater became head of the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.'s news division. A pictureof his father was displayed prominently in Jennings' office off ABC'snewsroom.Charles Jennings' son had a Saturday morning radio show in Ottawa at age 9.Jennings never completed high school or college, and began his career as areporter at a radio station in Brockville, Ontario. He quickly earned an anchorjob at Canadian Television.Sent south to cover the Democratic national convention in 1964, the handsome,dashing correspondent was noticed by ABC's news president. Jennings was offereda reporting job and left Canada for New York.As the third-place news network, ABC figured its only chance was to go afteryoung viewers. Jennings was picked to anchor the evening news and debuted onFeb. 1, 1965. He was 26.""It was a little ridiculous when you think about it,"" Jennings told authorBarbara Matusow. ""I was simply unqualified.""Critics savaged him as a pretty face, and the experiment ended three yearslater. He later described the humbling experience as an opportunity, ""because Iwas obliged to figure out who I was and what I really wanted tobe.""Assigned as a foreign correspondent, Jennings thrived. He established an ABCNews bureau in Beirut, Lebanon, and became an expert on the Middle East. He wona Peabody Award for a 1974 profile of Egyptian President AnwarSadat.Jennings returned to the evening news a decade after his unceremonious departureand became the evening news anchor in 1983. Starting in 1986, Jennings began adecade on top of the ratings.He is survived by his wife, Kayce Freed, and his two children, Elizabeth, 25,and Christopher, 23.___On the Net:
At a music-filled memorial at Carnegie Hall, ABC News anchor Peter Jennings wasremembered Tuesday as a journalist with a childlike awe of the world, a devotedfather and loyal Canadian who always carried a copy of the U.S.Constitution.A picture of a smiling Jennings, the sun in his face and blue skies behind him,was projected over the stage of the New York landmark.The audience of about 2,000 people was filled with luminaries: Mike Wallace,Brian Williams, Dan Rather, Tom Wolfe, Larry King, Jon Stewart, Charles Gibson,Al Sharpton, Alan Alda, George Stephanopoulos, Bob Schieffer, Michael Eisner,Elizabeth Vargas and her husband Marc Cohn.""An anchor is what keeps a ship from drifting into dangerous waters,"" said ABCNews President David Westin. ""It keeps us steady and secure during the night,and that's what Peter was to ABC News.""When they joined the network four decades ago, Ted Koppel recalled how he wasknown as the smart one and Jennings the handsome one. Jennings _ who died oflung cancer Aug. 7 _ kept his looks to the end but was also ""very, very smart,""he said.""From the time I first met Peter 41 years ago until our last meeting a few weeksago, I felt a thrill whenever I saw him,"" the ""Nightline"" host said. ""Not thatmany people have that charisma, that kind of animal magnetism that makes itdifficult to focus on anybody else in the room.""Jennings, ABC's chief news anchor for more than 20 years, was also ""famouslyattracted to women,"" Koppel said. ""Even so, he only married four ofthem.""A handful of homeless people were also in the hall. Jennings' widow, Kayce, wasstartled recently when a homeless man approached to express sympathy for herloss; Jennings had befriended him during walks in Central Park.Jennings frequently served meals to the homeless after leaving the ABC Newsstudio and its evening broadcast of ""World News Tonight,"" said Mary BrosnahanSullivan of the Coalition for the Homeless.""The Peter I knew was somebody of concrete action,"" she said.Personal remembrances were interspersed with music _ a gospel choir, violinistNatalie MacMaster, cellist Yo-Yo Ma, singer Alison Krauss and a jazz combofeaturing Wynton Marsalis. Jennings was an insatiable jazz fan.""For Peter, jazz was more than just a form of music, it was a way of looking atlife,"" Westin said.A hopeless sentimentalist, Jennings was ""the only person I knew who got weepytelling about his service on jury duty,"" ABC producer Tom Nagorskisaid.Alan Alda recalled Jennings as ""complex and simple at the same time,knowledgeable and inquisitive, kind and tough at the same time, gracious anddirect."" He never left a social engagement without Jennings giving him a book;the last was a copy of the Constitution, he said.Jennings never lost his Canadian identity _ an honor guard from the RoyalCanadian Mounted Police marched at the service _ but was proud also to become aU.S. citizen a few years before he died.Since his death many of his ABC News colleagues have worn bracelets saying ""whatwould Peter do?"" For all the professional colleagues and anecdotes at thememorial, the pictures projected onstage showed an off-camera Jennings on familyoutings. Friends said his two children, Chris and Elizabeth, were his proudestaccomplishments.They were also the last to speak at the nearly two-hour remembrance.""There is no way to express how much I miss my father,"" his son said. ""Each dayis, above all else, a day without him.""
Peter Jennings, the urbane anchorman of ABC's evening newscast forthe past 22 years, died Sunday, it was announced by his network. Hewas 67.It was reported that he had died at his home in New York.Jennings had not been on the air since April 5 when he revealed hehad lung cancer. He had been conspicuously absent from the coverage ofPope John Paul II's funeral in Rome. A smoker until about 20 yearsago, he said he relapsed under the pressure of Sept. 11, 2001 butlater quit again.The Canadian-born Jennings was a familiar face in millions ofhouseholds for more than 40 years. His well-rounded tones, world-savvyair and matter-of-fact delivery led ``World News Tonight'' to the topof the ratings for 11 of the past 20 years, even as all the networkslost huge numbers of viewers to cable television, to the Internet andto the longer workdays and busier lives of those who used to watch thenews over the family dinner.Jennings ranged the world as a reporter and anchorman, specializingin the Middle East long before many domestic viewers knew much moreabout the region than the location of Jerusalem and the movie``Lawrence of Arabia.''He was at the Summer Olympic Games in Munich Sept. 5, 1972 whenArab terrorists seized and killed Israeli athletes. Familiar with thehistory and goals of the Black September terrorist group, Jenningsfiled a series of reports, and moved his camera crew close enough toget clear pictures of the terrorists, which ``displayed considerablemoxie,'' wrote Barbara Matusow in ``The Evening Stars: The Making ofthe Network News Anchor.'' She called it ``among the most grippingepisodes ever shown on live television.''Twenty-nine years later, Jennings was on the air within minutesafter two airliners crashed into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11,2001, and stayed on the air for more than 12 consecutive hours, andfor 60 hours that first week, ABC News said in its biography of theanchor. His steadiness and ``Herculean'' work during that period waswidely praised.``We watched Peter Jennings' beard grow, and we were somehowreassured that he did not shave, that through morning, afternoon,evening and on into the night, he did not leave the desk, that heconfided in us his uncertainties, that he shared the confusions ofeach hour,'' Washington Post columnist Marc Fisher wrote. ``He grewmore pale and more vulnerable, as if he knew that we needed him to behuman, so that we could be together.''During that devastating day, as all activity stopped and Americansremained glued to their televisions, Jennings' trademark cool warmedas he faltered just a bit.``We do not very often make recommendations for people's behaviorfrom this chair,'' he told viewers, ``but as (one ABC Newscorrespondent) was talking, I checked in with my children, and it --who were deeply stressed, as I think young people are across theUnited States. So, if you're a parent, you've got a kid'' -- he pausedand smiled awkwardly -- ``in some other part of the country, call themup. Exchange observations.''He became a citizen of the United States in 2003, 39 years after heleft Canada. ``There's no explaining the timing,'' he told USA Today.``Did 9/11 make a difference? Yes, it did make a difference. Didworking on (his book) 'In Search of America' for the last severalyears, which kept me on the road a lot and dealing with bothcontemporary and historic national issues -- about which I felt verydeeply? That made a difference.''His death marked a year in which the evening anchors of all threemajor broadcast networks left the anchor's chair. NBC's Tom Brokawretired in December 2004, and CBS' Dan Rather stepped down from theanchor's job in March 2005.Born in Toronto, the son of pioneering Canadian broadcaster CharlesJennings, an 11-year-old Peter Jennings first broadcast ``Peter'sPeople,'' a radio show for children. He dropped out of high school,worked briefly in a bank and then entered broadcasting. He became aradio news reporter in Brockton, Ontario and worked briefly for theCanadian Broadcasting Corp. before switching to co-anchor CTV NationalNews at Canada's first privately owned network in 1962. While coveringthe 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, Jenningsattracted the attention of the then-president of ABC, Elmer W. Lower,who offered him a job. Jennings turned it down but three months laterreconsidered.Based in New York City, he was immediately seen as a rising star. Ayear later, at age 26, he was named co-anchor and then sole anchor ofABC Evening News' 15-minute broadcast. His inexperience showed,especially in comparison to veteran competitors Walter Cronkite at CBSand Chet Huntley and David Brinkley on NBC. Widely derided as a``glamorcaster'' and ``anchorboy,'' Jennings was ridiculed for hisAnglicized diction and ignorance of American history and culture.After three years, he returned to the ranks of domestic newscorrespondents.He was sent to the Middle East in 1969 to establish the firstAmerican television news bureau in the Arab world, and there he foundhis niche. For seven years, based in Beirut, he traveled to virtuallyevery Arab country and built a store of knowledge he would draw uponfor years. His reporting during the 1973 Israeli-Arab war earned therespect of viewers. He conducted the first television interview withPalestine Liberation Organization's Yasser Arafat, and his 1974profile of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat won his first George FosterPeabody award. He was the first U.S. reporter to interview the IranianAyatollah Khomeini, then in exile in Paris.Jennings returned to the U.S. in 1975 as Washington correspondentand news reader for the predecessor to Good Morning America. After 10months, he was reassigned overseas as chief foreign correspondent,based in London.ABC executive Roone Arledge then created a three-anchor broadcast,with Frank Reynolds in Washington, Max Robinson in Chicago andJennings in London. In 1983, after Reynolds died of cancer, Jenningswas called back to the U.S. to retrieve his role as ABC's soleanchorman.His years at the helm were not without glitches. He, along with theother major networks, prematurely and erroneously reported thatDemocratic nominee Al Gore won Florida in the 2000 presidentialelection. Jennings was frequently accused of liberal bias byconservative media watchdog organizations, and pro-Palestinian bias byIsraeli partisans. A 2004 commentary in a journalism trade magazine,the Columbia Journalism Review, dismissed criticism that ABC'snewscast was ``anti-war,'' noting that ``despite the pressure to be acheerleader, World News Tonight with Peter Jennings was more probingduring the war than its rivals. The center's anti-war label is lookinglike ABC's red badge of courage.''Washington Post television critic Tom Shales, who is no fan ofJennings, in 1994 praised his special on the Bosnian war, writing,``You have to hand it to Peter Jennings. He has managed to maintainhis dignity and his stature even as network news has grownincreasingly tabloidian all around him. He has stayed above the fray,and as frays go, this one is particularly unsavory... It isn't luridor sexy and it probably won't get big ratings, but it's the kind ofthing a network news division ought to be doing just for the sake ofdoing it.... It could easily be argued that CBS News remembers (EdwardR.) Murrow in words, whereas ABC News remembers him in deeds -- deedslike tonight's Jennings report.''Five times he was named the country's best anchorman in a poll ofreaders of another trade magazine, Washington Journalism Review. Hewon Harvard University's Goldsmith Career Award for excellence injournalism and the Radio and Television News Directors Paul WhiteAward, chosen by the news directors of all three major networks.``World News Tonight'' was honored with the Edward R. Murrow award forbest national newscast in 2004. He won 14 national Emmys, two GeorgeFoster Peabody awards, several Overseas Press Club awards and severalAlfred I duPont Columbia University Awards for journalism.In addition to anchoring, he covered issues in depth on hour-longprimetime specials, called ``Peter Jennings Reporting.'' Begun in1990, the show ranged from historic issues such as the Kennedyassassination to religious controversies to the crisis in arts fundingto a chronicle of the bombers of Oklahoma City, as well asinternational crises. He anchored live news specials for children, andco-wrote ``The Century'' (1998) with Todd Brewster, which later becamea 12-hour ABC series. He and Brewster also collaborated on ``In Searchof America'' (2002).His marriages to Valerie Godsoe, Annie Malouf and Kati Marton endedin divorce.Survivors include his wife, Kayce Freed of New York City; and twochildren from his third marriage, Elizabeth and Christopher. 
Peter Jennings, a Canadian-born high school dropout who became theface of ABC News and a household name in the United States, died oflung cancer Sunday at his home in New York. He was 67.ABC News announced his death Sunday night and released a statementfrom his wife Kayce Freed, his 25-year-old daughter Elizabeth Jenningsand his 23-year-old son Christopher Jennings.``Peter died with his family around him, without pain and inpeace,'' it read. ``He knew he'd lived a good life.''His death was met with grief at ABC, where he functioned as boththe public face and behind-the-scenes manager of ``World NewsTonight.''ABC News President David Westin called the 41-year ABC veteran --known for his urbane demeanor and driven perfectionism -- ``ourcolleague, our friend, and our leader,'' adding: ``None of us will bethe same without him.''Westin said Jennings had faced his fight against lung cancer ``withrealism, courage, and a firm hope that he would be one of thefortunate ones.''``In the end, he was not,'' he said.Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in U.S. men andwomen, accounting for 163,510 deaths this year. Most cases of lungcancer are directly attributable to smoking.A lung cancer diagnosis presents a poor prognosis, with a one-yearsurvival rate of only 42 percent and a five-year rate of 15 percent.Jennings' death comes as a bitter bookend to a decades-long era intelevision news dominated by three well-known figures: the longtimeABC newsman, CBS' Dan Rather and NBC's Tom Brokaw. Brokaw retired inDecember, and Rather stepped down from the evening news in March.A longtime smoker, Jennings first announced his diagnosis April 5,when he said he would begin chemotherapy treatment.In a poignant taped message that aired on ``World News Tonight,''Jennings -- his voice already hoarse and raw -- said he had quitsmoking 20 year ago but was ``weak'' and took it up again after theSept. 11, 2001, attacks. He pledged to continue to anchor ``World NewsTonight'' on ``good days.''That was his last time on the air. In his absence, ``Good MorningAmerica'' co-host Charles Gibson and ``20/20'' co-anchor ElizabethVargas, among others, have filled in for him.During his four decades at ABC -- especially his last 22 as anchor-- Jennings developed a reputation for rigorous standards and adevotion to substantive stories, especially international affairs. Asmanaging editor of ``World News Tonight,'' he combed over every scriptthat went on the broadcast.``Peter was a real guardian at the gate,'' said Judy Muller, acontributing ABC correspondent and an assistant professor at theUniversity of Southern California. ``He was so committed to theintegrity of news.''Peter Charles Archibald Ewart Jennings was born on July 29, 1938,in Toronto. He spent most of his childhood in Ottawa.He gained his passion for broadcast news from his father, CharlesJennings, who was the first person to anchor a nightly national newsprogram in Canada and became head of the Canadian BroadcastingCorporation's news division.Jennings once referred him as his ``only hero.''At age 9, Jennings was already hosting a weekly children's showcalled ``Peter's People'' on CBC radio, reading letters from childrenon the air. But he was unenthusiastic about school and dropped out ofhigh school in the 10th grade.He quickly made his way in broadcasting, working for a small radiostation in Brockville, Ontario, and then landing a job as the host ofa CBC public affairs show in Montreal.At age 24, he was already co-anchoring Canada's first privatenetwork newscast and was spotted by an ABC correspondent covering aNATO meeting. ABC recruited the young anchor in 1964.Impressed with his good looks and poise, the network thrust himbriefly into the anchor chair, but the 26-year-old proved to be toogreen for the post.In 1967, he began his career as a foreign correspondent, openingthe network's bureau in Beirut, Lebanon. He rapidly made his mark incovering hot spots around the world. He was in Munich, Germany, in1972 when Arab terrorists took Israeli athletes hostage at theOlympics. He covered the battle over apartheid in South Africa and wasin Berlin to report on the Berlin Wall coming down.Jennings became ABC's chief foreign correspondent and was based inLondon when the network asked him to return to the anchor desk as partof a three-person team, with Frank Reynolds based in Washington andMax Robinson in Chicago.When Reynolds died of cancer in 1983, Jennings took over as theonly anchor. He helped power ABC to the top of the ratings for adecade, winning over viewers with his witty, sophisticated manner. Hecontinued to travel extensively to cover stories, and was mostrecently in Iraq in January to report on the elections there.``He was a person with an enormous amount of experience andself-confidence -- and a presence,'' said Richard Wald, a former ABCNews executive. ``That's all you can say about him. He had it, healways did.''Aside from his wife and children, he is survived by his sisterSarah Jennings.There was no immediate word on services.
Anchor Peter Jennings' death was met Monday with a cascade ofsorrowful appreciations from national leaders, colleagues and viewersaround the country as anguished ABC employees struggled to absorb theimpact of his loss on the network.Jennings -- who died at home in New York on Sunday night fourmonths after he was diagnosed with lung cancer -- was hailed as afiercely determined newsman who infused his broadcasts with asophisticated sensibility honed by years as a foreign correspondent.Often demanding, he occasionally frustrated co-workers with hisrelentless probing, an approach many credit with raising the standardsof ABC News.He was lauded by everyone from President Bush -- who called him ``apart of the life of a lot of our fellow citizens'' -- to more than25,000 viewers who posted messages on the ABC News Web site expressingtheir grief at his death.``One word describes Peter Jennings on air: Class,'' wrote one.``He shall be missed.''With his death, retired NBC anchor Tom Brokaw said that he felt``as if I've lost a member of my family,'' while former CBS anchor DanRather praised Jennings as ``one of the most talented, caring andsuccessful electronic journalists of all time.''The debonair Jennings anchored ``World News Tonight'' for the last22 years, half of his four decades-long career at ABC. As managingeditor of the evening broadcast, he oversaw each story that went onthe air, personally editing nearly every story script.``In many respects, Peter is the news division,'' said Paul Slavin,senior vice president of worldwide newsgathering for ABC News. ``Therewas never a decision that was made without considering what Peterthought about it. ... He was, in a way, the persistent conscience.''Jennings' death forces ABC to confront a similar challenge that NBCand CBS have faced in the last year: settling on a successor for anestablished anchor. Brokaw's handoff of the ``NBC Nightly News'' toBrian Williams in December was long-planned and widely praised as aseamless transition. CBS has tapped veteran Washington correspondentBob Schieffer to temporarily replace Rather, who left the anchor deskin March, while the network mulls over a new format for its broadcast.ABC executives said Monday that no decisions have yet been madeabout who will take over for Jennings. For now, ``Good MorningAmerica'' co-host Charles Gibson and ``20/20'' co-anchor ElizabethVargas will continue to anchor ``World News Tonight'' on a temporarybasis.Network officials had hoped that the changes at the other networksthis year would give Jennings a chance to regain the title of thetop-rated evening newscast, a position he held from the mid-1980s tomid-1990s. But after the anchor, a longtime smoker, learned he wasfighting lung cancer in April, he immediately began chemotherapy.``He has left us with a phenomenal foundation, and it is afoundation that we will move forward with,'' Slavin said. ``Thecorporeal part of Peter may not be here, but his thoughts and hisideas, his demands for excellence and his heart will stay here.''As an exacting editor, Jennings pushed himself and those around himrelentlessly, often asking correspondents to repeatedly rewrite theirstory scripts.``He drove everyone very hard, including and perhaps especially,himself,'' said congressional correspondent Linda Douglass. ``Heinvolved himself in every detail of our news coverage, from decidingwhich stories were covered to how they were covered to how the storieswere written. At ABC News, it felt as though he was in ourbloodstream.''Paul Friedman, a longtime executive producer of ``World NewsTonight,'' said Jennings had an ``insatiable curiosity.''``He was a perfectionist, which made him terrific to work with inthe sense that it was challenging all the time, and occasionallydifficult,'' Friedman said.(Begin optional trim)Jennings' drive was rooted partly in his embarrassment that henever completed high school or college, according to friends andformer colleagues. Wherever he traveled for stories -- which was often-- the anchor brought with him a suitcase full of books to read.``He felt he had to prove himself,'' said CNN Washington bureauchief David Bohrman, who worked with Jennings for more than a decadeas a senior producer at ABC. ``You always got the impression that hefelt he was going to be exposed as a fraud any minute because hedidn't finish school. He just couldn't rest. He never realized howgood he was.''(End optional trim)Colleagues said Jennings also brought a sentimental, compassionateapproach to stories that he rarely let viewers see. Slavin said theanchor would push producers to home in on the emotional core of thenews, such as a mother's loss of her son in Iraq.``He is one of the most sensitive, emotional anchors in thebusiness,'' said Slavin, repeatedly referring to Jennings in thepresent tense.Up until his final days, Jennings believed he could win his battlewith lung cancer, friends said.``Frankly, I thought he would as well, because I knew what a brave,fierce competitor he was,'' Rather said. ``But the odds were toolong.''Times staff writer Henry Weinstein contributed to this report.
Peter Jennings' untimely death Sunday put a period to the era inwhich network anchors derived their ``authority'' from journalisticexperience, as well as on-camera presence.If television viewers are unlikely to see his equal again, it hasless to do with Jennings' unique personal qualities -- formidable asthey were -- than with the melancholy state of the three broadcastnetworks' news operations. Years of shortsighted and unremittingcost-cutting by their corporate proprietors have made them shells ofwhat they once were. Among the network and cable news divisions, onlyCNN maintains anything like a full-service foreign reportingoperation; increasingly, even the others' commitment to comprehensivedomestic coverage is withering.So if ABC wanted to cultivate another Jennings -- someone with asophisticated reportorial background and an engaging broadcast persona-- it simply lacks the organizational ability to do it.In 1965, for example, when the then-26-year-old Jennings had adisastrous first go at anchoring ABC's nightly newscast, he describedhimself as ``simply unqualified.'' To remedy that, he spent more thana decade reporting from ABC bureaus in the Middle East and Europe. Bythe time he was named as one of three co-anchors of the network's``World News Tonight'' in 1978, he was ABC's chief foreigncorrespondent.Can anybody name the person who occupies that assignment today?Perhaps more important, can anyone imagine one of the current crop oftelevision news ``personalities'' admitting he or she is unqualifiedto do anything from brain surgery to stand-up comedy?Although wealth and celebrity came with his anchorman's chair,Jennings never lost his field reporter's legs. It seems a commonplaceobservation to make, but constantly gathering facts and, then,thinking about them in some systematic way is what preparesjournalists to respond intelligently to the demands of breaking news.Most recently, many Americans saw Jennings do just that in the morethan 60 hours of sober and reflective broadcasting he did in theimmediate aftermath of the 9/11 atrocities.Monday, his former colleague Barbara Walters was among those whosingled out Jennings' nearly unmatched ability to ad lib smartly andoften eloquently while covering developing stories. Canadian newsanchor Lloyd Robertson said that ``Peter brought a high quality ofliterature to electronic journalism. There was nobody who could putthings together on the air as easily and as rapidly as he did.''(Begin optional trim)Part of that was mental agility, part unremitting attention to hiswork. During the mid-1990s, my wife, Leslie Abramson, was a legalanalyst for ABC News. While on business in New York, she ran intoJennings, who invited her to join a group of network executives andbroadcasters that night at the Committee to Protect Journalists'annual dinner.During the course of the essentially ceremonial evening with itsintroductions and speeches, Leslie noticed Jennings repeatedlyreaching into an inside coat pocket for a small, bound notebook inwhich he made notations.``Are you taking notes on this?'' she asked.``No,'' Jennings replied. ``I write down thoughts as they occur tome. You never know when you're going to need a good idea.''(End optional trim)Relentless and inquisitive preparation was one thing thatdistinguished Jennings' journalism, but so did a perspective thatactually was quite singular. The cool, engaged-but-somewhat-apartpersona that Jennings brought to his on-screen work was as much asmatter of intellect as temperament. Jennings the journalist wasquintessentially a man of the middle distance.Some of that may have been attributable to his Canadian origins.U.S. attitudes toward the rest of the world tend to oscillate betweenhysterical triumphalism and lacerating self-loathing. Around bothpoles, what tends to be lost is the fact that there are other peoplein the world, who live their own lives and act for reasons of theirown. As a physically vast nation with a tiny population, most of whichlives hard up against the United States, Canadians tend to approachother people and countries with a wry combination of self-deprecationand self-assertion. Those qualities were one of the things that madeJennings a superb foreign correspondent.Shortly after 9/11, Jennings became a naturalized American, thoughhe retained his Canadian citizenship. In an interview with theCanadian Press at the time, he explained his decision: ``I am aCanadian. My mother, like many of her generation, always found areason to resent the United States and defined herself as a Canadianby being not American.'' In the wake of the attacks on the World TradeCenter and Pentagon, however, Jennings experienced his connection toother Americans in an urgent new way. ``I felt more attached to themthan I perhaps had anticipated in emotional terms,'' he said. ``Thisis my home.''As television news increasingly trades on attitude andentertainment rather than reporting and analysis, one of the thingsthat will be missed most about Jennings and his work is the respect heshowed for American viewers. Without intending to, he once summed thatquality up in an interview with the Toronto Star:``There are a lot of people in this business who believe that partof our job is to reassure the public every night,'' Jennings said. ``Isubscribe to leaving people with essentially a rough draft of history.Some days it is reassuring. Some days, it is absolutely destructive.''One of the tragedies of our time is that the corporate time-serverswho now direct the course of broadcast journalism do not share PeterJennings' faith that American viewers are entitled to that respect.
Peter Jennings' four-decade career as a networktelevision reporter and anchor made him a national media star, butthose who knew the ABC newsman best remembered him Tuesday in deeplypersonal terms, recalling the ``goofy'' father who loved to dance thejitterbug while cooking and the man of quiet generosity who took apersonal interest in the homeless living in Central Park.A two-hour memorial service, held at Carnegie Hall a little morethan a month after the 67-year-old anchor died of lung cancer, focusedless on his work as a broadcast journalist and more on recollectionsof his private life by family, friends and colleagues.``He was often described as cosmopolitan, but I think my fathervalued awe over sophistication,'' said Christopher Jennings, his23-year-old son, noting his love of canoe trips and his fiercedevotion to his family.``The slightest achievement by his children -- or even his dog --could wet his eyes,'' he said. ``My father gave love in earnest.''``Each day is, above all else, a day without him,'' his son added.About 2,000 people filled the gilded auditorium for the emotionalcelebration of Jennings' life, including nearly all of the toptelevision network executives and journalists: NBC anchor BrianWilliams, ``Today'' co-hosts Katie Couric and Matt Lauer, former CBSanchor Dan Rather, current CBS anchor Bob Schieffer, ``Good MorningAmerica'' co-hosts Charles Gibson and Diane Sawyer, Fox News host BillO'Reilly, CNN anchor Aaron Brown and PBS interviewer Charlie Rose.(Former NBC anchor Tom Brokaw was caring for his mother in Californiaand could not attend.) New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg attended, ,as did his predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and the Rev. Al Sharpton.Performers included cellist Yo-Yo Ma and jazz trumpeter WyntonMarsalis.``From the time I first met Peter 41 years ago until our lastmeeting a few weeks ago, I felt a thrill whenever I saw him,'' saidTed Koppel, host of ABC's ``Nightline.'' ``Not many people havegenuine charisma, that kind of animal magnetism that makes itdifficult to focus on anyone else in the room. Peter had that.''Jennings' death on Aug. 7, just four months after he had announcedhis diagnosis, has been a major blow to ABC. The network has notsettled on who will replace him as anchor of ``World News Tonight.''Robert Iger, chief executive of the Walt Disney Co., ABC's parentcorporation, said the company owed Jennings ``an extraordinary debt ofgratitude'' for his work, adding how difficult it was to accept hisdeath.``When you know someone of Peter's dynamism and presence, yousimply think they will always be there,'' Iger said at the memorial.But for the most part, speakers took note of their private loss. Amontage of photos projected on the back of the stage throughout theservice depicted Jennings' off-air life: bicycling and hanging off theside of a sailboat, embracing his children and walking arm in arm withhis wife, Kayce Freed. In the images, Jennings looked tan and healthy,squinting into the sun with a contented smile.Actor Alan Alda said Jennings was simply ``authentic.'' He recalledhow the anchor would insist on staying to help wash dishes afterdinner parties and how he always gave him a book to read after visits,most recently a copy of the U.S. Constitution.``There's a vacancy now that no president can fill, no power onEarth can fill,'' Alda said. ``Others will step in and fill in hisshoes excellently. But no one can replace the unique presence that wasPeter.''Mary Brosnahan Sullivan, executive director of the Coalition forthe Homeless, said a number of homeless people who live in the parkacross from Jennings' Manhattan apartment approached his widow, Kayce,after he died, offering their condolences and noting how he frequentlytook the time to speak with them. Jennings often volunteered todistribute meals to the homeless around the city, she said, and wouldengage in long conversations with the people he met.``Maybe today,'' she said, ``we can try to see the world the wayPeter saw it.''Jennings' 25-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, spoke last, telling thetearful audience: ``Without him, I find myself stumbling and in thedark. ... Loving him so much and not having him with me is the hardestthing I've ever done.''
Peter Jennings, a high school dropout from Canadawho transformed himself into one of the most urbane, well-traveledand recognizable journalists on American television, died Sunday. He was67 and lived in Manhattan.The cause of death was lung cancer, said Charles Gibson, whoannounced the death of his colleague on television in aspecial report just after 11:30 p.m. Jennings had disclosed thathe was suffering from lung cancer on April 5, firstin a written statement released by ABC and later thatnight on ""World News Tonight,"" the evening news broadcast thathe had led since September 1983.In brief remarks at the end of that night's program, Jennings,his voice scratchy, told viewers that he hoped to returnto the anchor desk as his health and strength permitted.But he never did.It was a jarring departure for someone who for so longhad been such a visible fixture in so many Americanhomes each night. Along with the two other pillars ofthe so-called ""Big 3"" -- Tom Brokaw of NBC andDan Rather of CBS -- Jennings had, in the early1980s, ushered in the era of the television news anchoras lavishly compensated, globe-trotting superstar. After the departure of Brokawfrom his anchor chair in December, followed by Rather's retirementfrom the evening news in March, Jennings' death brings thatera to a close.For more than two decades, the magnitude of a news eventcould be measured, at least in part, by whether Jenningsand his counterparts on the other two networks showed upon the scene. Indeed, they logged so many miles overso many years in so many trench coats and flakjackets that they effectively acted as bookends on some ofthe biggest running stories of modern times.Jennings' official ABC biography notes, for example, that as a foreigncorrespondent, he was ""in Berlin in the 1960s when theBerlin Wall was going up,"" and there again, as ananchor, ""in the 1990s when it came down."" Similarly, hewas on the ground in Gdansk, Poland, for the birthof the Solidarity labor and political movement, and later forthe overthrow of the country's communist government.In addition to every major world capital and war zone, Jenningsalso reported from all 50 states, according to the network.He seemed to draw on that collective experience -- aswell as his practiced ability to calmly describe events asthey unfolded live -- not long after two hijacked planesstruck the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001. Overthe course of that day, and those that immediately followed,he would spend more than 60 hours on the airin what Tom Shales of The Washington Post, among othercritics, praised as a tour de force of interviewing andexplanatory broadcast journalism laced with undisguised bewilderment.""This is what it looked like moments ago,"" Jennings said atone point that first morning, as he introduced a pieceof videotape recorded moments earlier in Lower Manhattan. ""My God!The southern tower, 10:00 Eastern time this morning, just collapsingon itself. This is a place where thousands of peopleworked. We have no idea what caused this.""The coverage of all three broadcast networks that week underscored amaxim of the television news business: that however much theaudience of the evening news programs may have eroded inrecent years, viewers usually return during moments of crisis.At the peak of his broadcast's popularity, in the 1992-93 televisionseason, Jennings drew an average audience of nearly 14 millionpeople each night, according to Nielsen Media Research.(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)He reached that milestone midway through an eight-year ratings winning streak,during which his audience sometimes exceeded those of both Brokawand Rather by 2 million or more viewers. (For nearlya decade since, to his periodic frustration, his broadcast hadlagged behind that of NBC's, even after Brokaw yielded toBrian Williams in December.)Though the audience for the evening news has fallen precipitously inrecent years -- a casualty of changes in people's schedulesand the competition offered by the cable news networks andthe Internet -- Jennings' broadcast (and those on CBS andNBC) still drew a combined audience of more than 25million viewers this past year.And however much his audience had aged -- the median ageof a Jennings viewer this past season was about 60,according to Nielsen -- advertisers still spend in excess of$100 million annually on each of the evening news programs.Like Brokaw, Rather and now Williams, Jennings was well paidfor his efforts: he earned an estimated $10 million ayear in recent years.(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)His most recent contract with the network was due to expirelater this year, but at least until he took ill,the network was preparing to extend Jennings' time in theanchor chair for ""several years to come,"" according to DavidWestin, president of ABC News.Jennings' broadcast training had begun at an astonishingly young age, afunction at least partly of his pedigree. Peter Charles Jenningswas born July 29, 1938, in Toronto. His father, Charles,was a senior executive of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation anda pioneer in Canadian radio news.In ""The Century"" (Doubleday, 1998), one of two coffee-table-worthy history booksthat he cowrote with Todd Brewster, Jennings recalled an earlyexercise that his father put him through in an effortto sharpen his powers of observation. ""Describe the sky,"" hisfather had said. After the young boy had done so,his father dispatched him outside again. ""Now, go out andslice it into pieces and describe each piece as differentfrom the next.""By age 9, he had his own show on Canadian radio,""Peter's Program."" He dropped out of high school at 17,and by his early 20s was the host of adance show similar to ""American Bandstand"" called ""Club Thirteen.""His rise to the pinnacle of Canadian television news, and laterits far larger counterpart to the south, was swift. In1962, at age 24, he was named co-anchor of thenational newscast on CTV, a competitor of his father's network,a job that he held until 1964.That year, he moved to the United States to begin workas a correspondent for ABC. Barely a year later, thenetwork named him an anchor of ""ABC Evening News,"" thena 15-minute newscast, which put him -- at age 26-- head-to-head with Walter Cronkite on CBS and the formidabletandem of Chet Huntley and David Brinkley on NBC. Thoughhe would serve ABC in that capacity for nearly threeyears, Jennings said in an interview last year that hewas ill-suited for the job and unhappy in it.""I had the good sense to quit,"" he said.What followed was more than a decade of postings abroad asa foreign correspondent for ABC, during which, Jennings said lastyear, he got an on-the-job introduction to the world witha tuition bill effectively footed by his employer.""I have no formal education to speak of,"" Jennings said. ""ABChas been my education and provided my education. ABC hasenabled me to work everywhere in the world and hasended up paying me beyond handsomely.""From 1968 to 1978, Jennings traveled extensively, including to Vietnam, Munich,Germany (where he covered the hostage-taking at the 1972 SummerOlympics), and Beirut, Lebanon (where he established the network's firstnews bureau in the Arab world.)In 1978, he began his second tour as an anchor forthe network, serving as one of three hosts of ""WorldNews Tonight,"" along with Frank Reynolds and Max Robinson, ina format devised by Roone Arledge, the legendary sports programmerwho had added the news division to his portfolio. Jenningswas the program's foreign anchor, and reported from London until1983.Three weeks after Reynolds died following a battle with bone cancer,Jennings was named the sole anchor (and managing editor) ofthe broadcast, titles that Mr. Jennings continued to hold athis death.As an anchor, Jennings presented himself as a worldly alternative toBrokaw's plain-spoken Midwestern manner and Mr. Rather's folksy, if attimes offbeat, Southern charm. He neither spoke like many ofhis viewers (""about"" came out of his mouth as a-BOOT,a remnant of his Canadian roots) nor looked like them,with a matinee-idol face and crisply tailored wardrobe that werefrequently likened in print to those of James Bond.Though his bearing could be stiff on the air (and hissyntax so simplistic at times as to border on patronizing),Jennings was immensely popular with his audience.(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)During a trip last fall through Kansas, Pennsylvania and Ohio inthe weeks before the presidential election, he traveled at timesaboard a coach customized by the news division to trumpetits campaign coverage and frequently received a rock star's welcomewhen he decamped.For example, in the parking lot of a deli just outsideof Pittsburgh, where he had come to interview a long-shotcandidate for Congress whose threadbare headquarters was upstairs, Jennings foundhimself on the receiving end of several hugs from loyalviewers.""He's so handsome,"" one of those viewers, Vilma Berryman, 66, thedeli owner, observed immediately after meeting him. ""He's taller thanI thought. He speaks so softly.""Like all of the Big 3, Jennings was not without hisdetractors. Among his critics were those who contended he wastoo soft on the air when describing the Palestinian causeor the regime of the Cuban leader Fidel Castro --accusations he disputed. Similarly, an article published in July 2004in the National Review portrayed him as a thinly veiledopponent of the American war in Iraq.The article quoted Jennings as saying: ""That is simply not theway I think of this role. This role is designedto question the behavior of government officials on behalf ofthe public.""Jennings was conscious of having been imbued, during his Canadian boyhood,with a skepticism about American behavior; at least partly asa result, he often delighted in presenting the opinions ofthose in the minority, whatever the situation.And yet, he simultaneously carried on an elaborate love affair withAmerica, one that reached its apex in the summer of2003, when he announced that he had become an Americancitizen, scoring, he said proudly, 100 percent on his citizenshiptest.In a toast around that time that he gave at thenew National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, he described his adoptedhome as ""this brash and noble container of dreams, thismuse to artists and inventors and entrepreneurs, this beacon ofoptimism, this dynamo of energy, this trumpet blare of liberty.""Jennings' personal life was at times grist for the gossip pages,including his three divorces. His third wife, the author KatiMarton, whom he married in 1979 and divorced in 1993,is the mother of his two children, who survive him.They are a daughter, Elizabeth, and son, Christopher. He isalso survived by his fourth wife, Kayce Freed, a formerABC television producer whom he married in December 1997. Havingprided himself on rarely taking a sick day in nearly40 years -- and being dismissive, at times, of thosehigh-paid colleagues who did -- Jennings had missed the broadcastand the newsroom terribly in recent months.In a letter posted on April 29 on the ABC newsWeb site, excerpts of which were read on that night'sevening news, Jennings described how treatments for his cancer hadproven more debilitating than he had anticipated.""Yesterday I decided to go to the office,"" he wrote. ""Ilive only a few blocks away. I got as faras the door. Chemo strikes.""""Do I detect a knowing but sympathetic smile on many ofyour faces?"" he added.About a month later, Jennings did make a rare visit tothe ABC News headquarters on the Upper West Side ofManhattan. With a gray sweater draped over his shoulders, andhis feet clad in thick wool socks and moccasins, Jenningsheld court for about a half-hour late one morning fromhis desk, in what is known as ""the rim,"" anewsroom one floor below the ""World News Tonight"" studio.His voice soft and his body as much as 20 poundslighter than usual, Jennings told several dozen staff members whohad gathered around his desk about the doctors and otherpatients he had been meeting and of a first-time radiationtreatment that he had just received, according to one veterancorrespondent who did not wish to be identified so asnot to offend Jennings' family.Jennings brought himself and many of his colleagues to tears whenhe turned to Charles Gibson, one of his two principalsubstitutes on the program, and thanked him for closing eachnight's broadcast with the phrase, ""for Peter Jennings and allof us at ABC News."" Jennings then put his handover his heart and said, ""That means so much tome,"" according to his colleague.But whatever maudlin feelings were in the air quickly evaporated, Jennings'longtime colleague recounted, when the anchor brandished a familiar blackcalligraphy pen and began marking up the rundown for thatnight's broadcast. ""No, that's not a good one,"" he couldbe overheard telling Jonathan Banner, the program's executive producer, aboutone segment. Of another, he added, ""You want to movethis higher up.""For his closest colleagues, the reassuring sight of the anchor-as-editor provideda fleeting moment of normalcy in what had been adisorienting and heartbreaking few months.
Peter Jennings, the ABC News anchor who diedlast month, was recalled as a devoted father, hard-driving journalistand a man who befriended homeless people, during a serviceat Carnegie Hall on Tuesday. The service was sprinkled withreflections from Jennings' colleagues at ABC, his two children andfriends, like the actor Alan Alda. Because Jennings was amusic lover, there was music, too, with selections that includedbagpipers escorted by members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,Wynton Marsalis on trumpet and a cello solo by Yo-YoMa.""We're left now with just a little bit of snow atthe bottom of the screen,"" Alda said in describing Jenningsas irreplaceable. He was a ""truly authentic"" person who conveyedhis mix of graciousness, candor and concern to the millionswho watched him as anchor of ""World News Tonight,"" Aldasaid.He never left Jennings' home without a book in tow, Aldarecalled, and Jennings -- a Canadian who became a U.S.citizen -- always carried a copy of the Constitution. Othersrecalled Jennings' fondness for canoeing, his way of putting peopleat ease and his heart-on-his-sleeve sentimentality. He was, they said,a friend who stuck around for life's inevitable heartbreaks.""He never, ever let us down,"" said Charles Glass, a journalistwho helped Jennings cover the Arab-Israeli war for ABC.With lines stretching around the block, the two-hour service attracted ordinarypeople paying their respects, ABC and Walt Disney Co. executivesand colleagues who included Ted Koppel, Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer,Larry King, Jon Stewart and Katie Couric. Mayor Michael R.Bloomberg and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani also attended, asdid Al Sharpton.Photographs of Jennings, often with friends or with his children, Christopherand Elizabeth Jennings, were flashed on a big screen inthe cavernous Stern Auditorium. Jennings, one of the most recognizablejournalists on American television, died on Aug. 7 from lungcancer. He was 67 years old.Koppel drew laughter throughout his remarks. He facetiously announced that hewas not gay, but then said that during their 41-yearfriendship he was keenly aware of his friend's extraordinary charisma.""I felt a thrill whenever I saw him,"" he said.He continued: ""Peter was notoriously attractive to women. Even so,he only married four of them.""Robert A. Iger, president of the Walt Disney Co., remembered Jennings'""uncanny ability to entertain and to inform,"" as the primaryface of ABC during significant world events. At the sametime, during a recent lunch, Jennings agreed with him thatnothing was more satisfying than seeing their children grow up,Iger said.Tom Nagorski, the producer of ""World News Tonight,"" said Jennings' formerstaffers now wear plastic blue bracelets that say, ""What wouldPeter do?"" Jennings was forever arranging and rearranging his staff'spersonal and professional lives, he said. He even chided Nagorski,then the foreign editor, for planning his wedding at thesame time as the elections in South Africa. Then, withcharacteristic good cheer, Jennings offered to help with wedding plans,he said.Jennings' widow, Kayce Freed, has been stopped in recent weeks bynumerous homeless people offering their condolences, said Mary Brosnahan Sullivan,executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless. For thehomeless, Jennings delivered meals, inquired about their lives and donatedmoney to organizations, Sullivan said.Christopher Jennings said his father integrated his children into his world,taking them to his office and on assignment, soliciting theirviewpoints. Jennings was often described as cosmopolitan, he said, buthe was also a man who always cherished ""the abilityto be awed.""
ABC News anchor Peter Jennings died of  lung cancer at the age of 67 on Sunday, his company said.The Canadian-born broadcaster who delivered the news to Americans each night in five separate decades died at his New Yorkhome, said ABC News President David Westin late Sunday.Jennings announced in April that he had lung cancer and would begin treatment.Although he occasionally came to the office after his diagnosis, he never again appeared on the air. Jennings anchored ABC's World News Tonight for more than 20 years.Jennings, the face of the ABC News, logged more than 60 hours on the air during the week of the terrorist attacks in the United States on Sept. 11, 2001.
","Peter Jennings, a Canadian-born high school dropout, who became the face of ABC News and a household name in the United States, died in August 2005. He was 67. ABC News stated, ""Peter died with his family around him, without pain and in peace."" A friend said Jennings had faced lung cancer ""with realism, courage, and a firm hope that he would be one of the fortunate ones."" In the end, he was not. Jennings' death brought to an end a decades-long era in television news dominated by three figures, CBS's Dan Rather, NBC'S Tom Brokaw and ABC's Jennings. ","Although Jennings indicated that he would return as anchor when able, he was never able. In a letter posted on April 29 he described how treatments had proven more debilitating than he had anticipated. About a month later he appeared at ABC News headquarters, his voice soft and his body as much as twenty pounds lighter than usual, and mentioned that he had started radiation treatment. Up until his final days, Jennings believed he could win his battle with lung cancer, but on Aug. 7, 2005 he died at his home in New York. ","Jennings had hoped to return to the anchor desk as his health and strength permitted. But he never did. He wrote later that he once decided to go to the office ""I got as far as the door. Chemo strikes"". He also received radiation. He never again appeared on air. Until his final days, he believed he could win his battle but he died on 7 August at his home in New York. He was 67. President Bush paid tribute. More than 25,000 viewers posted messages on the ABC News site. A two-hour memorial service was held at Carnegie Hall. ","Peter Jennings died from his lung cancer on August 7. He never appeared on the news after the taped April announcement. His treatments, which included radiation beginning in May, were too debilitating. He had lost 20 pounds the first month. Only 42% of lung cancer victims survive for at least one year. His death drew appreciation from national leaders, colleagues, and viewers. Two thousand people attended his September memorial service. "
D0928,D0928-A,"A federal judge has allowed Tyco International Ltd. shareholders togo forward with a class action lawsuit against the company andothers.But U.S. District Judge Paul Barbadoro on Thursday struck down arelated claim that sought damages on behalf of Tyco stemming fromallegations of fraud and corporate looting.Former top executives L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swartz areawaiting retrial in federal court in New York on charges of stealing$600 million (euro483.33 million) from the company. Their first trialresulted in a hung jury. They have denied the charges.Barbadoro dismissed the claim seeking damages on behalf of Tycoagainst most of its current directors and several of its formerdirectors and officers. Barbadoro said it was barred under Bermudalaw. Tyco, managed from West Windsor, New Jersey, is registered inBermuda.""This represents a big shareholder win and a major step forward inthe case,"" Jay Eisenhofer, the plaintiffs lawyer, said in astatement.Barbadoro rejected the defendants' attempt to separate the accountingfraud allegations from the looting allegations, finding ""bothinterrelated and interdependent.""In the class-action lawsuit, shareholders seek damages against thecompany, Kozlowski; Swartz; Mark Belnick, former director FrankWalsh; and the company's auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers.According to some estimates, investors lost $60 billion (euro48.33billion).In a prepared statement, Tyco spokesman David Polk said: ""We believewe have a very strong case, and we are prepared to defend itvigorously.""
A judge refused to combine a retrial of larceny charges againstformer Tyco International Ltd. chief executive L. Dennis Kozlowskiwith a trial on charges that he failed to pay sales taxes on $13million worth of art.In denying the prosecution's consolidation request on Monday, stateSupreme Court Justice Michael Obus noted that the larceny trial, setto begin Jan. 18, includes Tyco's former chief financial officer MarkSwartz, 44. The judge said there is not enough evidence that Swartzwas involved in the tax scheme to join that trial with the larcenyretrial.""There is no evidence that Swartz entered into any agreement, tacitor express, with either Kozlowski or the art vendors to avoid thepayment of the sales tax,"" Obus wrote in his 11-page ruling.The tax indictment charges Kozlowski, 57, with conspiracy, falsifyingbusiness records and tampering with evidence. Obus had earlier notedthat nonpayment of sales taxes is not a crime but it is a crime tofail to collect them.Obus also said the charges involved different victims _ Tyco and itsshareholders in the larceny case, New York state in the tax evasioncase.In the tax case, Kozlowski was accused of scheming with dealers toavoid paying more than $1 million on $13 million worth of artworks.In the larceny case, Kozlowski and Swartz are accused of looting morethan $600 million from Tyco.If convicted on the first-degree grand larceny charge after theirretrial, Kozlowski and Swartz each could face up to 25 years inprison.Tyco, based in Bermuda but with U.S. headquarters in West Windsor,New Jersey, makes everything from telecommunications equipment tohome alarm systems.
The retrial of two top Tyco International executives accused of stealing $600million (euro458 million) of company money to finance lifestyles of gaudy excessis set to begin next week. Legal experts say prosecutors should, and probablywill, focus less on items like the $6,000 (euro4,580) gold-threaded showercurtain bought with company money and concentrate more on the allegedthefts.The first trial of L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swartz was aborted after sixmonths last year by a menacing letter and telephone call to ajuror.Prosecutors have told the judge they expected to present a shorter, leaner caseagainst Kozlowski, Tyco's former chairman and chief executive officer, and MarkSwartz, the former finance chief. They expect it to last a little more than fourmonths.In the first trial in Manhattan's State Supreme Court, prosecutors gave jurors avideotaped look at the $2 million (euro1.53 million) birthday party Kozlowskithrew for his wife on a Mediterranean island, and a video tour through his $18million (euro13.75 million) Fifth Avenue apartment _ .Jurors were told Kozlowski spent some $11 million (euro8.4 million) of Tyco'smoney to furnish the apartment with amenities such as a $4,050 tablecloth and a$515 toaster. There was also a $2,900 set of hangers, a $4,995 custom-madeblue-and-gold bedskirt, and a $2,665 blue velvet pillow.And those were the little things.The jurors also saw a Persian rug that cost $191,250, a George I walnutarabesque clock that set Tyco back $113,750, an Ascherberg grand piano that cost$77,000, and a pair of French antique stools, bought for $125,000.Prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau's office said atthe time that the extravagances demonstrated the defendants' greed and showedwhere some of the money they allegedly stole ended up.Kozlowski, 58, and Swartz, 44, are charged with grand larceny, falsifyingbusiness records, conspiracy and business law violations.Prosecutors said the defendants stole $170 million (euro130 million) by hidingunauthorized bonuses and secretly forgiving loans to themselves, and pocketed anadditional $430 million (euro328 million) by pumping up Tyco stock by lyingabout the state of the company's finances.Defense lawyers said Kozlowski and Swartz earned every penny they got fromTyco.The trial judge, Justice Michael Obus, has already thrown out the top charge inthe original indictment _ enterprise corruption. That count suggested thatKozlowski and Swartz had conspired with others to turn Tyco into a criminalenterprise.If convicted of the current top charge, first-degree grand larceny, and theother more serious counts, the defendants each face up to 30 years inprison.Tyco, which has about 270,000 employees and $36 billion (euro27.5 billion) inannual revenue, makes a wide range of products including electronics, medicalsupplies and security devices.
Jury selection began Tuesday for the second trial of two former top TycoInternational Ltd. executives charged with looting the company of $600 million(euro459 million) to subsidize their lavish lifestyles.Prosecutors promised to present a leaner case this time against former Tycochairman and CEO L. Dennis Kozlowski and former chief financial officer MarkSwartz.In the first trial, prosecutors played a videotape of the $2 million (euro1.53million) birthday party Kozlowski threw for his wife on a Mediterranean island,and a video tour through his $18 million (euro14 million) Fifth Avenueapartment.This time around, prosecutors were expected to focus less on items such asKozlowski's $6,000 (euro4,600) gold-threaded shower curtain and more on how heand Swartz allegedly looted the company.The retrial is expected to last about four months.Kozlowski, 58, and Swartz, 44, are charged with grand larceny, falsifyingbusiness records, conspiracy and business law violations.The defendants each face up to 30 years in prison if convicted of the mostserious charges.Their first trial, which lasted six months, was aborted last year because of amenacing letter and telephone call to a juror.Kozlowski and Swartz are accused of stealing $170 million (euro130 million) byhiding unauthorized bonuses and secretly forgiving loans to themselves, andpocketing $430 million (euro329 million) more by pumping up Tyco stock with liesabout the state of the company's finances.Defense lawyers said Kozlowski and Swartz earned every penny they got fromTyco.The judge has already thrown out the top charge in the original indictment _enterprise corruption. That count suggested that Kozlowski and Swartz hadconspired with others to turn Tyco into a criminal enterprise.Tyco, which has about 270,000 employees and $36 billion (euro27.6 billion) inannual revenue, makes a wide range of products including electronics, medicalsupplies and security devices. The company is based in Bermuda. Its U.S.headquarters is in West Windsor, New Jersey.
The two former top executives of Tyco InternationalLtd. stole $150 million from the industrial conglomerate even thoughthey were among the highest-paid people in corporate America, aprosecutor told jurors as their retrial began Wednesday.In a 3 1/2-hour opening argument, assistant Manhattan districtattorney Owen Heimer said L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swartz earnedalmost $300 million in legitimate pay between 1999 and 2001, but tookthe additional money to finance sumptuous lifestyles that includedpurchases of lavish apartments and fancy artwork.``This authorized compensation -- as huge as it was -- was just notenough for these two men,'' Heimer said. ``They had to have more, sothey stole another $150 million.''The first trial of Kozlowski and Swartz ended in mistrial lastApril after a juror's actions upstaged the legal proceedings.The juror, retired teacher Ruth B. Jordan, made a gesture in courtthat some observers interpreted as an ``OK'' sign to the defendants.Jordan was identified by several news organizations and subsequentlyreceived a threatening letter, prompting the judge to declare amistrial a week later.On Wednesday, Jordan sat in the back row as Heimer finished hispresentation.``I'm interested -- that's all,'' Jordan said afterward inexplaining her appearance. She indicated that she may attend furthercourt sessions, but would not come regularly. ``I've got a life,'' shesaid.Kozlowski, Tyco's former chief executive, and his one-time chieffinancial officer Swartz are accused of grand larceny, securitiesfraud and conspiracy in an alleged plot to loot the company and cheatshareholders.The men, who have pleaded not guilty, face up to 30 years in prisonif convicted.Defense attorneys are scheduled to give their opening statementsThursday. In the first trial, defense lawyers said the executives'actions were approved by the board, and that living an extravagantlifestyle is not a crime.Heimer argued Wednesday that Kozlowski and Swartz committed a rangeof illegal acts, including drawing huge loans from the company andthen instructing underlings to erase them from the books. The men toldTyco employees that the board of directors had ``forgiven'' the loansthrough bonuses even though they hadn't, Heimer said.After the first trial, several jurors criticized the ManhattanDistrict Attorney's office for what they saw as an overly lengthy andponderous presentation. The trial had gone on six months before endingin mistrial.Heimer appeared to be cognizant of that Wednesday as he delivered acrisp and methodical argument that focused on seven specific instancesof alleged theft.
L. Dennis Kozlowski wants to be clear: The$6,000 shower curtain wasn't his idea.The shower curtain, bought by his decorator on Tyco International's tabfor an extravagantly furnished Manhattan apartment, became perhaps the mostnotable symbol of corporate excess and conspicuous consumption of the1990s.""I understand why a $6,000 shower curtain seems indefensible,"" Kozlowski, Tyco'sformer chief executive, said on the eve of his retrialon charges of looting the company. ""But I didn't knowabout it. I just wasn't even aware of it.""Dressed in a pair of jeans and hiking boots, Kozlowski didnot look much like a swashbuckling, custom-suit-wearing chief executive.He did not sound like one either. Soft-spoken and uncharacteristically reticentat times, Kozlowski, in his first extensive interview since hewas charged more than two years ago with stealing hundredsof millions of dollars from Tyco, said that he wasinnocent and that the public perception of him was misguided.""People think that I'm a greedy guy; that I was overcompensated,""he said, leaning forward in his chair. ""Greed, I think,is the key word. But while I did earn enormoussums of money, which for a poor kid from Newarkwas spectacular, I worked my butt off, and it wasall based on my performance in Tyco's long established pay-for-performanceculture.""That image of greed, of course, stems from accusations that henot only awarded himself unauthorized bonuses, but that he hadthe company also pay $15,000 for an umbrella stand andhalf the cost of a multimillion-dollar birthday party for hissecond wife in Sardinia, with a now notorious ice sculptureof Michelangelo's ""David"" that flowed vodka.But Kozlowski, who faces a second trial on Tuesday in NewYork state Supreme Court in Manhattan, portrayed himself as aself-made entrepreneur who has become the victim of an overzealousprosecutor interested in sensational headlines and a board trying toprotect itself from shareholder lawsuits. While clearly anxious about theretrial and humbled by the enormity of the situation, heremained unapologetic about his conduct at Tyco.""I firmly believe that I never did or intended to doanything wrong,"" he said. ""I never thought in my wildestimagination I or any of us did anything wrong myentire time there. I still cannot believe that they saywords like larceny.""It is a long way down from flying on private jetsand being driven everywhere by a chauffer. ""I'm given anallowance to pay for food and, you know, basic essentialsthat I need,"" Kozlowski said.The case against him, he argued, should have been heard ina civil court, not criminal. ""I do believe this isa civil case between Tyco and I. After 27 years,there was an unamicable breakup, a faulty divorce. And Ido believe this should be ironed out in a civilmanner and certainly not in a criminal manner.""
Prosecutors have been chasing corporate crooks and piling up big statisticsin court for five years. Now get ready for aseries of trials featuring many of the biggest executives chargedwith the most audacious crimes of their era.A few big figures, like Martha Stewart and Frank Quattrone, weremixed into the mostly no-name court lineup last year. But2005 will be remembered as the year of the marqueeCEO on trial. Take a look at this lineup:Bernie Ebbers. The trial of the former WorldCom Inc. chief executivecharged as the front man for an $11 billion fraudbegins this week in New York.Ebbers is charged with fraud and conspiracy in the WorldCom collapse,the largest bankruptcy in US history. Former chief financial officerScott Sullivan, who cut his own plea deal, will bethe government's star witness.This will be an important test of the ""idiot CEO"" defense(see Richard Scrushy and Ken Lay, below). Ebbers is expectedto say he left all the numbers to Sullivan, whotold prosecutors what they wanted to hear when he gotin trouble. Ebbers was a big-picture guy.L. Dennis Kozlowski, the sequel. The former Tyco International Ltd. chiefwho became a symbol of material excess began his retrialin New York Tuesday.The first trial of Kozlowski and Tyco chief financial officer MarkSwartz ended in a sensational mistrial after a juror favoringacquittal found herself in the middle of a media frenzyand ultimately received a threatening note.Kozlowski and Swartz are charged with stealing hundreds of millions ofdollars from Tyco by hiding details of their compensation fromdirectors and selling big blocks of company stock after inflatingits value.But it was Kozlowski's outrageous spending on the company tab ($15,000for an umbrella stand?) that got most of the headlines.Richard Scrushy. The founder of HealthSouth Corp. is charged as themastermind behind a $2.7 billion earnings fraud in a trialunderway in Alabama. A jury is being selected.The HealthSouth scam wasn't as big as the WorldCom fraud, andthe company continues to operate today. But Scrushy takes thecake when it comes to defense stories. He wasn't justthe idiot CEO, he may have been in a coma.Prosecutors will rely on five former chief financial officers who willall implicate Scrushy as the ringleader. One secretly recorded theformer chief executive for the government.Scrushy will blame his lieutenants for inflating HealthSouth's profits. See apattern?Ken Lay. The former Enron Corp. chairman faces two trials. One,in which Lay faces fraud, conspiracy, and bank fraud chargesalone, will probably be held later this year. The other,in which he is charged along with two other formerEnron executives, may not make it to court before spring2006.Former chief executive Jeff Skilling and ex-chief accounting officer Richard Causeywill join Lay at a second fraud trial.The Enron team was on the job during the most infamouscorporate fraud of its time. More than 5,000 employees losttheir jobs when Enron filed for bankruptcy in 2001. Lay,as you surely know by now, was just another big-pictureguy in the dark about his company.The idiot CEO strategy may sound risky, but it has beensuccessful elsewhere. A jury in Hartford was unable to reacha verdict against former Cendant Corp. chairman Walter Forbes twoweeks ago, despite incriminating testimony from three executives.The trials ahead culminate the effort to hold people criminally responsiblefor the worst excesses of a dangerously excessive time. Butdon't count the idiots out yet.Steven Syre is a Globe columnist. He can be reached atsyreglobe.com.
The Triple Crown of corporate scandals reached full stridethis week with the spectacle of three former big-money CEOson trial simultaneously.Cases against Tyco's Dennis Kozlowski and WorldCom's Bernie Ebbers Jr. beganlast week in New York. The trial of HealthSouth's RichardScrushy launched Tuesday in Birmingham.The coincidental confluence gives Americans a glimpse of corporate theater: Accountantsin the limelight. CEOs on hot seats. Lavish lifestyles ondisplay.Legal and business academics say the cases raise questions about bigthemes, such as the delicate balance between a free marketand government regulation. But academics doubt Americans will be asriveted by the trials as they were by less significantcourtroom dramas like the California case against wife-murderer Scott Peterson.""It's hard for a lot of people to get outraged. Theysee them as a bunch of rich people ripping offa bunch of other rich people,"" said Robert Thompson, aSyracuse University professor of TV and pop culture.Actually, corporate scandals hurt workers, clients and stockholders at all levels,Thompson said. But plenty of educated Americans find it excruciatingto sort through complex financial allegations to keep track ofsuch malfeasance after recent government crackdowns, he said.After all, this is just the latest bubble of corporate trials.A similar round in 2003 and 2004 included the firsttrial of Tyco's Kozlowski -- which ended in a mistrial-- and cases against former Wall Street investment banker FrankQuattrone, former Rite Aid senior executive Franklin C. Brown andcorporate chief/home maven Martha Stewart.While corporate cases in recent years have tended to be big,allegations of wrongdoing are far from new in the worldof business, said Emory law professor William Carney. ""My firstreaction to some of these cases is, 'Ho-hum, just anotherfinancial fraud case.' ""But Columbia University law professor John Coffee said the latest caseshighlight how prosecutors are broadening what they consider corporate crimesthey will pursue. In past decades, business leaders usually facedonly civil penalties for wrongdoing, except in cases of taxfraud, insider trading or price-fixing, Coffee said.""Now we are seeing virtually any kind of corporate scandal thatinvolves the interest of investors will be examined and scrutinizedby criminal enforcers,"" he said.The allegations of the Tyco case -- including news of lavishparties and a $6,000 shower curtain -- revolve around whethercorporate executives had the permission of the company's board beforeembarking on ""extraordinary conspicuous consumption,"" he said.HealthSouth's Scrushy is fighting allegations of fraud and stock manipulation forsupposedly trying to make the company's financial situation look betterthan it was, Coffee said. Ebbers is charged with fraudafter the collapse of the long-distance phone company he founded.The cases will focus public attention again on corporate misbehavior, Coffeesaid. But Americans' views of what is reprehensible will bedetermined by ""who goes to prison and for what.""Matt Kempner writes for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. E-mail: mkempner@ajc.com
Prosecutors rewrote their opening script for the retrial of L. DennisKozlowski and Mark H. Swartz on Wednesday, purging the moststriking accusations of lavish spending that they had concentrated onduring the first trial.Instead, prosecutors focused on laying out the core theme of theircase, saying the two men, former Tyco executives, had illegallyawarded themselves millions of dollars in bonuses and concealed themfrom the company's board and shareholders.""This case is the story of how two men -- thedefendants in this case -- stole $150 million from acompany named Tyco and that corporation's owners, its shareholders,"" saidOwen Heimer, an assistant Manhattan district attorney, in his openingstatement in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. ""Thesedefendants ran Tyco, but they did not own Tyco.""While the case against Kozlowski and Swartz is very similar tothe first trial, the prosecution's new strategy -- conceived afterhours of interviews with jurors from the previous trial whocriticized their approach as unfocused -- may mean this trialcould take on a markedly different tone.The prosecution needed no reminder of that trial. The lessons ithad learned were already on display: Heimer, a veteran, wasadded to the prosecution's team and took the lead inopening arguments, while Kenneth Chalifoux, an assistant Manhattan district attorneywho presented a meandering and often confusing opening during thefirst trial, looked on from the prosecution's table.Lawyers for Kozlowski and Swartz are scheduled to present their openingarguments on Thursday.Heimer spent much of his presentation arguing that Kozlowski and Swartzhad intended to commit a crime. In the last trial,at least one juror said she had been prepared toacquit on all charges because she could not find thatthe men had the requisite criminal intent. Many other jurorssaid they, too, had wrestled with the issue of criminalintent. Heimer repeatedly spoke to the jury of a processhe described as ""instruct, deceive and conceal.""He said he would show evidence that the men had instructedtheir subordinates to forgive loans, deceived the subordinates by tellingthem the bonuses had been approved by the board andthen had concealed the payments from the board and thepublic by not disclosing them.Heimer said the men had also paid their subordinates unapproved bonuses""because they were buying the employees' loyalty and buying theemployees' silence.""
NEW YORK - Defense lawyers took a decidedly new approach intheir opening arguments in the retrial of L. Dennis Kozlowskiand Mark H. Swartz in state Supreme Court on Thursday,lashing out at the former directors of Tyco and attackingtheir credibility.Prosecutors are saying the two men had illegally awarded themselves millionsof dollars in bonuses and concealed them from the company'sboard and shareholders.Lawyers for both defendants, who had appeared to soft-peddle that issuein the first trial, told the jury that the directors'accusations that the two men stole more than $150 million-- the entire basis of the prosecution's case -- ispart of a self-serving strategy by directors to protect themselvesfrom shareholder lawsuits.""The directors are concerned about their pocketbook,"" Kozlowski's lawyer, Stephen Kaufman,said, calling their contention that they had never approved millionsof dollars of bonuses for the men ""revisionist history."" Raisinghis voice, Kaufman added: ""If Dennis can be blamed, thathelps them.""Swartz's lawyer, Charles Stillman, applied the same theme, telling jurors, ""Youneed to decide who is telling you the truth."" Butin a revealing moment, Stillman also appeared to divulge astrategy shift, one that could ultimately pit Swartz against Kozlowski.At the end of his presentation, Stillman told the jury,""You must consider the evidence for each man separately.""That statement is a departure from the strategy that defense teamsused in the first trial in which both appeared toapproach the case with an all-for-one and one-for-all policy. Indeed,throughout Stillman's presentation Thursday, he constantly referred to Swartz individuallyand rarely mentioned Kozlowski's unless he was making the casethat Swartz was his subordinate.Before the first trial and the retrial, Swartz had sought toseparate the cases, but the judge refused the requests. Still,Stillman's remarks were the first time he seemed to tryto distance Swartz from Kozlowski, despite the fact that bothmen are charged with nearly all the same crimes. Theshift may be the result of interviews with jurors fromthe first trial, who said that they liked Swartz, whotestified in the first trial, better than they liked Kozlowski,who did not testify.One issue that both defense teams did agree on was tomake the issue of criminal intent a part of theirpresentations. In the first trial, which ended in a mistrial,at least one juror said she was planning to acquitthe men because she could not find that the defendantshad criminal intent.Kozlowski's lawyer, Kaufman, spoke in front of a projection screen thatsaid ""Good Faith Belief Equals No Criminal Intent.""""The facts are that every penny that my client earned wason the books and records of the company he headed,""he said. ""Dennis never committed any act of concealment.""""Criminals act in criminal ways,"" Kaufman said. ""Does this strike youas a criminal acting in a criminal way?""Stillman, who stood next to a placard with a similar messageabout criminal intent, also told the jury, ""Mark had nocriminal intent because his intentions were honest. No criminal intentmeans no crime.""Jurors in the retrial, which is expected to last about fourmonths, are expected to hear the first testimony on Monday.Rebutting each of the accusations the prosecution made on Wednesday duringits opening argument, Stillman also sought to dissuade the juryfrom putting any stock in one of the prosecution's mainpieces of evidence, the company's board minutes. The prosecution saidit plans to show that the board approved none ofthe bonuses paid to Kozlowski and Swartz and documented inthe minutes. Stillman said the minutes ""cannot be relied onto prove anything"" because they are incomplete. He went onto say that he planned to prove that ""the directorskept no minutes for half of their meetings."" He added,""You will hear of meeting in which important decisions weremade and no minutes.""As he closed, Stillman told the jury to pay attention towhat the directors actually did, not what they said. ""Mymother taught me actions speak louder than words,"" he said.
","In January 2005, Dennis Koslowski and Mark Swartz, former top executives of Tyco International Ltd., went on trial in New York a second time for stealing $600 million from the company. The first trial ended in a hung jury. Prosecutors claim the two men illegally awarded themselves millions of dollars in bonuses and concealed them from the company's board and shareholders. A judge refused to combine a retrial of larceny charges against Kozlowski with charges he failed to pay sales taxes on $13 million worth of art. If convicted, Koslowski and Swartz each could face 25 years in prison. ","The first grand larceny trial of former Tyco CEO Dennis Kozlowski and codefendant Mark Swartz ended in mistrial. Their retrial began January 18. They allegedly stole $600 million from the company in unauthorized compensation and the sale of inflated Tyco stock. Kozlowski could face 30 years in prison. Prosecutors are focusing less on Kozlowski's life of excess and more on how he allegedly looted the company. In opening arguments, the defense suggested the compensation was legitimate, and company directors might be practicing revisionist history. Kozlowski still faces separate tax, conspiracy, falsifying business records and evidence tampering charges. ","Former Tyco executive Dennis Kozlowski has been charged in a tax case with conspiracy, falsifying business records and tampering with evidence. He is accused of scheming with dealers to avoid paying over $1M tax on $13M of artworks. He and another Tyco executive, Mark Swartz, are also accused in a larceny case of looting over $600M from the company by illegally awarding themselves bonuses and concealing them from shareholders. A trial of the two ended in a hung jury. They are to be retried in New York. The judge refused separate trials. ","The first unfocused, lengthy trial of Tyco executives Kozlowski and Swartz for stealing $600 million from Tyco was aborted after juror intimidation. The judge ruled a claim on behalf of Tyco was barred under Bermuda law, but allowed a class action lawsuit by Tyco shareholders. He refused to separate the two men's cases or allegations of accounting fraud and looting. In the retrial, prosecutors are concentrating on accusations that the men hid unauthorized bonuses, secretly forgave loans to themselves, and lied about Tyco's finances to inflate stock before selling it. The defense is trying to discredit the board of directors. "
D0928,D0928-B,"A retired chairman of the board of Tyco International Ltd. testified thecompany's financial monitors never told him about millions of dollars inforgiven loans and bonuses for Tyco's two top executives.Lawyers for L. Dennis Kozlowski, Tyco's former CEO, and Mark H. Swartz, thecompany's former finance chief, suggested that former chairman John F. Fort andother directors knew about _ but did not protest _ money the executivesreceived.Fort, 63, was chairman of the board's audit committee for much of Kozlowski'stime as CEO. He said Mark Foley, Tyco's director of financial operations, nevertold him Kozlowski and Swartz had a total of $37.5 million in loans from Tyco in1999.Fort, under redirect questioning by prosecutor Ann Donnelly, also said the headof Tyco's external audit team, Richard Scalzo of the accounting firmPricewaterhouseCoopers, never told him anything about Tyco's finances beingamiss.Fort said he asked Scalzo in each audit committee meeting whether he had seenanything that might hurt or embarrass the company or that the board needed toworry about, and Scalzo always answered that nothing was wrong.""In each meeting he assured us of that,"" Fort testified.Fort was the first witness in the retrial of Kozlowski and Swartz, and testifiedfor three full days.Kozlowski, 58, and Swartz, 44, are on trial in Manhattan's state Supreme Courton charges of grand larceny, securities fraud, falsifying business records andrelated counts. If convicted of grand larceny alone, each could face up to 25years in prison.Prosecutors say Kozlowski and Swartz stole $150 million outright by improperlyforgiving company loans to themselves, awarding themselves unauthorized bonusesand having Tyco pay for their personal expenses.Prosecutors say the defendants also made undetermined illegal profits by selling$575 million worth of Tyco stock whose value they had artificiallyinflated.When the trial continues Thursday, the next witness is expected to be FrankWalsh, a former Tyco director whose receipt of a $20 million investment banking""fee"" marked the beginning of the end of Kozlowski's tenure.Walsh was indicted in connection with the payment but pleaded guilty and escapedprison in part by returning the money.Tyco International Ltd., which has more than 250,000 employees and $36 billionin annual revenue, makes a wide range of products including electronics, medicalsupplies and security devices. It is nominally based in Bermuda but has itsoperations headquarters in West Windsor, New Jersey.
A $2 million (euro1.5 million) birthday party, a key component in theprosecution's case in the first trial of Tyco International Ltd.'s former topexecutives, was raised for the first time Tuesday in their retrial.In his third day of questioning by prosecutors, Mark D. Foley, Tyco's formersenior vice president of finance, testified that he was told the 2001 party wasa ""management meeting"" on the island of Sardinia off the coast of Italy andwould include a meeting of Tyco's board of directors.Foley said he later learned the meeting would include a number of nonmanagementpersonnel.""I think it worked out close to 50-50,"" Foley said in response to a question byAssistant District Attorney Marc Scholl.Prosecutors claim the weeklong event was more of a celebration for ChiefExecutive L. Dennis Kozlowski's wife, Karen Mayo, rather than a companyfunction. The event was attended by about 75 people, including Chief FinancialOfficer Mark H. Swartz.Kozlowski, 58 years old, and Swartz, 44, are on trial in New York State SupremeCourt, facing charges of grand larceny, securities fraud and other crimes inconnection with giant bonuses and other compensation they received while workingas Tyco's top executives. They each face up to 25 years in prison on the mostserious charge of grand larceny. They have denied wrongdoing.Their first trial ended in a mistrial in April after a juror reported receivinga phone call and letter about the case during deliberations. The juror's namehad been disclosed by several news organizations after she appeared to give an""OK"" signal to the defense.In the first trial, Barbara Jacques, a former Tyco employee who helped plan theevent, testified that about half the party was paid for by Tyco and the rest waspaid by Kozlowski. During her testimony, prosecutors played a videotape of theparty, which included an elaborate ice sculpture of Michelangelo's David, modelsin Roman dress and a performance by pop musician Jimmy Buffett.As cross-examination by defense attorneys began Tuesday, Foley testified that hewasn't instructed to withhold documents from Tyco's auditors, its auditcommittee or the company's directors.""Did Dennis Kozlowski ever tell you to withhold any records from the outsideauditors?"" asked James R. DeVita, one of Kozlowski's lawyers.""No,"" Foley said.Tyco has its headquarters in Bermuda, but now operates out of West Windsor, NewJersey___Chad Bray is a correspondent of Dow Jones Newswires
Tyco International Ltd.'s former head of finance testified Thursday he never sawthat millions of dollars in special bonuses for former top executives L. DennisKozlowski and Mark H. Swartz were ever approved by the company's compensationcommittee.Under questioning by prosecutors, Mark D. Foley, the Bermuda conglomerate'sformer senior vice president of finance, also said he wasn't aware of anydocuments being provided to the committee that detailed the special bonuses paidto Kozlowski, Tyco's former chief executive, and Swartz, its ex-chief financialofficer, in those years.""Did you know of any document provided to the compensation committee that statedDennis Kozlowski got $32 million in loan forgiveness and gross ups in September2000?"" asked Assistant District Attorney Marc Scholl.""No,"" Foley said.Prosecutors claim Kozlowski and Swartz took millions of dollars of compensationwithout proper authorization by Tyco's directors, including more than $32million (euro24.13 million) in loan forgiveness and payments to cover taxes,known as gross ups, to Kozlowski in 2000.Kozlowski, 58 years old, and Swartz, 44, are on trial in New York State SupremeCourt, facing charges of grand larceny, securities fraud and other crimes inconnection with giant bonuses and other compensation they received while workingas Tyco's top executives.

The juror's namehad been disclosed by several news organizations after she appeared to give an""OK"" signal to the defense.In his fifth and final day of testimony, Foley said management representationletters provided to Tyco's auditors and its directors indicated millions ofdollars in management bonuses were paid to key employees in 1999 and in 2000,but didn't specifically state bonuses were paid to Kozlowski and Swartz. Moredetailed documentation of the bonuses were provided separately to the auditors,Foley said.""Was Dennis Kozlowski a key Tyco employee?"" asked James R. DeVita, one ofKozlowski's lawyers.""Yes,"" Foley said.Brian Moroze, Tyco's deputy general counsel, testified Thursday that Swartzordered him to change a company relocation program in 1995 to allow certainemployees to borrow money for more than one home.Moroze said Swartz, in a handwritten memo, also told him to change the programto extend the period in which employees could receive temporary housingassistance from 12 months to 24 months and to add language that allowed theemployees to receive educational expenses for their children. The program was inconnection with the relocation of certain employees to New York, includingKozlowski and Swartz.Before that, Tyco had only provided ""bridge"" loans for relocation, meaningemployees could borrow against the equity in their homes to buy a new home neartheir new work location. The employee would repay the bridge loan when they soldtheir old home, he said.However, Moroze said he didn't have personal knowledge if the company'scompensation committee ever approved the changes.Tyco has its headquarters in Bermuda, but now operates out of NewJersey.Chad Bray is a correspondent of Dow Jones Newswires
Former Tyco International Ltd. chief L. Dennis Kozlowski took the witness standWednesday and denied he ever abused company loan programs or received a bonus towhich he was not entitled.Testifying in his own defense at his retrial on larceny charges _ he did nottake the stand at the first trial _ Kozlowski said his intent was always to growthe company, never to commit a crime.Still, asked by his lead lawyer why a $25 million (euro19 million) bonus fromthe company did not appear on his 1999 tax return, Kozlowski said he could notexplain why.""I just was not thinking when I signed my tax return that I had a $25 millionloan forgiveness,"" Kozlowski said. ""Year in and year out at Tyco, my tax returnsfor the most part had been correct. I didn't pick up on it.""The $25 million forgiveness of loans from the company had come as part of $62million (euro48 million) in bonuses Kozlowski received at the time. Prosecutorssay it should have been reported as income.Tyco, which has about 250,000 employees and $36 billion (euro27.8 billion) inannual revenue, makes electronics and medical supplies and owns the ADT homesecurity business. Nominally based in Bermuda, its operations headquarters arein West Windsor, New Jersey.Kozlowski, 58, was the first defense witness in the trial of him and formerChief Financial Officer Mark H. Swartz, 44. The two are accused of looting theconglomerate of $600 million (euro460 million).They are accused of stealing $170 million (euro131.5 million) from Tyco byhiding unauthorized pay and bonuses and by abusing company loan programs andmaking $430 million (euro332.8 million) by inflating the value of Tyco stock bylying about the company's finances.The defendants are being retried in Manhattan's state Supreme Court on chargesof grand larceny, falsifying business records and violating state business laws.Their first trial ended in a mistrial in April 2004 after a juror receivedmenacing messages during deliberations as a result of her name beingpublished.The press customarily does not name jurors during a trial.Kozlowski, whose appearance as a witness was something of a surprise, began byanswering a series of questions posed by his lawyer, Stephen Kaufman. Had heever taken a bonus to which he was not entitled? Did he abuse Tyco's loan andrelocation programs?Kozlowski replied ""no"" to each question.Kozlowski later testified that he thought a $20 million (euro15.5 million) feehe paid Tyco board member Frank Walsh for arranging the acquisition ofcommercial lender CIT Inc. had been proper.When another board member suggested Walsh should give the fee back because ofenhanced corporate scrutiny following the fall of Enron Corp., Kozlowski said hedefended the deal.""I said if they thought I did something wrong I was willing to step down as CEOof Tyco,"" Kozlowski said.He said none of the directors objected. Walsh later quit the Tyco board ratherthan give the fee back.Kaufman asked Kozlowski: ""Did you believe the payment of the fee to Frank Walshrequired the authorization of the board of directors?""""No, I did not,"" Kozlowski replied.""Did you intend to steal the money?"" the lawyer asked.""Absolutely not,"" Kozlowski said.Swartz was the only defense witness in the first trial. On the witness stand fornine days, he explained in detail Tyco's compensation plans, his and Kozlowski'srelations with the board of directors and actions that prosecutors said wereillegal.On Tuesday, after the prosecution rested, defense lawyers suggested thatKozlowski could testify, but they insisted no decision had beenmade.
Prosecutors began cross-examination of L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chiefexecutive of Tyco International Ltd., seeking to show that he had no authorityto dip into company coffers on his personal whims.""Tyco was not your company, was it?"" prosecutor Ann Donnelly asked the formerCEO.""Tyco belongs to the shareholders,"" Kozlowski answered.""And Tyco's money was not your money to spend on yourself as you pleased, wasit?"" Donnelly asked.""That's correct,"" Kozlowski replied.Kozlowski, 58, and former Chief Financial Officer Mark H. Swartz, 44, are intheir second trial on grand larceny charges in Manhattan, accused of looting theconglomerate of $600 million. Their first trial ended in a mistrial in April2004.Kozlowski took the witness stand Wednesday in his own defense, testifying thathis intent was always to boost the company's fortunes, never to commit acrime.He also said then that he was ""not thinking"" when he left a $25 million bonusoff his 1999 tax return and said he never abused company loanprograms.The prosecutor attacked Kozlowski's claim that he relied on others to preparefinancial documents, including his income taxes. She cited his work history asinternal auditor and chief financial officer at several Tyco units before hebecame CEO.""Now, we're talking about your personal income taxes,"" Donnelly said toKozlowski.She asked whether a $25 million loan forgiveness that he says was a bonus shouldhave been on his W-2 tax form as income for 1999.""I absolutely agree that the $25 million belonged on my W-2,"" the former CEOsaid.Hinting at a motive for the omission, Donnelly displayed a tax form showingKozlowski earned $20.77 million and paid $9.66 million in taxes for 1999. Sheasked how much he would have had to pay if the $25 million had beenreported.Kozlowski replied that his tax bill would have been roughly $17.5million.""It's your testimony that you didn't notice that $25 million was missing (fromthe W-2 tax form)?"" Donnelly asked.""It is absolutely my testimony that I did not notice that it was missing,"" hereplied.Donnelly asked the former CEO about documents like proxy statements and annualreports that chief executives must sign. One of the charges against Kozlowskiand Swartz is that they falsified business records to hide thefts.Kozlowski said thousands of hours by experts, lawyers and accountants went intopreparing the statements and said he relied on them, but he conceded that hesigned the documents and was ultimately responsible.Kozlowski, who made more than $100 million a year in some of his years at Tyco,was asked whether he was once the country's highest paid CEO. He replied, ""Ibelieve I read that someplace.""Kozlowski and Swartz are accused of stealing $170 million from Tyco by hidingunauthorized pay and bonuses and by abusing company loan programs and making$430 million by inflating Tyco stock by lying about the company'sfinances.Kozlowski's cross-examination was to continue Monday.Tyco, which has about 250,000 employees and $40 billion in annual revenue, makeselectronics and medical supplies and owns the ADT home security business.Nominally based in Bermuda, its operations headquarters are in West Windsor,N.J.
A prosecutor turned the witness chair into the hot seat for former Tyco CEO L.Dennis Kozlowski on Monday with questions about $12 million the company spent ondecorations and millions more for art for Kozlowski's Manhattanapartment.Assistant District Attorney Ann Donnelly noted for the jury that 2001renovations on the Fifth Avenue apartment occurred at a time when Kozlowski hadpromised shareholders Tyco was engaged in a relentless push to save moneythroughout the organization. She asked Kozlowski if the decorations _ includinga $15,000 umbrella stand and dozens of paintings _ were inconsistent with ""arelentless push to cut costs.""""That's correct,"" he answered. ""It was overspent, and I take responsibility forthat. On the other hand, I thought it would appreciate in value.""Prosecutors have said furnishings at the luxurious duplex also included a $6,000gold-threaded shower curtain, a $2,900 set of hangers and a $2,665 blue velvetpillow.Kozlowski drew laughter from several jurors and a few raised eyebrows inManhattan's state Supreme Court when he said he did not like somedecorations.""I stuffed some in the closet,"" he said. ""Some of it was Godawful.""Kozlowski also defended as ""appropriate"" the company's $1 million expense for aweeklong celebration on the Italian island of Sardinia that was promoted as a40th birthday party for his wife.He said the birthday party, featuring a performance by singer Jimmy Buffett andscantily clad young men and women dancing and serving, was only one evening of atrip that rewarded some of the company's most overworked employees.""A perk trip like this from time to time spent money on employees to keep themmotivated and hopefully reward their spouses as well,"" he said.The prosecutor repeatedly brought up references to Kozlowski's wife, saying herclothing was at the Manhattan apartment, where an $18 million renovationrepaired light fixtures and damaged walls and floors before the decoratingbegan.Kozlowski said his wife spent only two nights in the apartment and he used itonly as a hotel room.""Her clothing might have been there, but she wasn't,"" he said.More than $10 million, most of it Tyco money, was spent on at least a dozenpaintings, including a Monet and a Renoir, for the apartment, the governmentsaid.Kozlowski insisted he enlisted a respected art dealer to obtain a fair price forTyco, sending her back to a London gallery to drive a $2 million price tag forsome art down another $50,000.""It's just like buying a car _ a very, very expensive car,"" he said, promptingone juror to snicker.The testimony came in the second trial of Kozlowski and former Chief FinancialOfficer Mark Swartz.Kozlowski, 58, and Swartz, 44, are charged with grand larceny, falsifyingbusiness records, conspiracy and business law violations. Their first trialended with a mistrial in April 2004 when a juror received a menacing letter andphone call after some media reported her name during deliberations.Kozlowski testified that his main residences were in Florida and New Hampshireand that he used the Manhattan apartment only for business meetings or when heneeded to stay in Manhattan.He said he never saw a bill for the decor, which was chosen by a woman who hadrenovated his property in New Hampshire and selected cushions for hisyacht.Kozlowski and Swartz are accused of stealing $170 million by hiding unauthorizedbonuses and secretly forgiving loans to themselves and pocketing $430 millionmore by pumping up Tyco stock with lies about the state of the company'sfinances.If convicted of the current top charge, first-degree grand larceny, and some ofthe other more serious counts, the defendants each could face up to 30 years inprison.Tyco International Ltd., which has about 250,000 employees and $40 billion inannual revenue, makes electronics and medical supplies and owns the ADT homesecurity business.

Former Tyco International Ltd. CEO L. Dennis Kozlowski finished four days oftestimony at his grand larceny trial, insisting that he left it to lawyers andaccountants to decide what to tell shareholders about his compensation.Testifying only briefly Tuesday in state Supreme Court in Manhattan in responseto followup questions from his lawyer, Kozlowski acknowledged that as CEO hesigned the company's most important documents relating to what was publiclyreported about his finances.He said he trusted the decisions of the lawyers and accountants and did notdirect them on whether to include information on public documents such as tensof millions of dollars in loans that were forgiven as part of his annual bonuspackages.Kozlowski also testified that he did not notice that $25 million in bonuspayments used to pay off a company loan was not included on his tax forms fromthe company for 1999.""No one ever told me it wasn't on my W2,"" he said, referring to the tax documentthat lists how much he was compensated for the year by the company. ""It neverdawned on me.""He also said he paid about $1 million of his own money toward the company'sweeklong celebration on the Italian island of Sardinia that was promoted as a40th birthday party for his wife. The company also paid about $1million.Since taking the stand April 27, Kozlowski testified extensively about the partyand the tens of millions of dollars the company spent on a Fifth Avenueapartment he said he used only sparingly.On Wednesday, Kozlowski's co-defendant, former Chief Financial Officer MarkSwartz, was to begin testifying.Kozlowski, 58, and Swartz, 44, are charged with grand larceny, falsifyingbusiness records, conspiracy and business law violations. Their first trialended with a mistrial in April 2004 when a juror received a menacing letter andphone call after some media reported her name during deliberations.They are accused of stealing $170 million from the company by hidingunauthorized bonuses and secretly forgiving loans to themselves and pocketing$430 million more by pumping up Tyco stock with lies about the company'sfinances.If convicted of the top charge against them, first-degree grand larceny, andsome of the other more serious counts, the defendants each could face up to 30years in prison.In their first trial, Swartz was the only defense witness. On the witness standfor nine days, he explained Tyco's compensation plans, his and Kozlowski'srelations with the board of directors and actions that prosecutors said wereillegal.Tyco International Ltd., which has about 250,000 employees and $40 billion inannual revenue, makes electronics and medical supplies and owns the ADT homesecurity business.

L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief executive ofthe conglomerate Tyco International, took the stand to declare hisinnocence at his retrial Wednesday, a surprising reversal in strategyfrom his first trial, at which he did not testify.As word spread early Wednesday at the New York State SupremeCourt in Lower Manhattan that Kozlowski was about to testify,the often near-empty courtroom quickly filled with spectators.Looking directly at the six men and six women of thejury, Kozlowski, whose first trial ended in a hung jury,explained why he had decided to take the stand. ""I'mhere so I can explain to them why I'm innocentof all the charges against me,"" he said, dressed ina gray suit, light blue shirt and navy tie.In long and sometimes rambling answers to his lawyer's questions, Kozlowskiportrayed himself as an earnest, often harried, executive who rosethrough the ranks and had the full support of thecompany's board. While his testimony was clearly prepared and perhapsunsurprising, Kozlowski will face his most important test as earlyas Thursday, when the prosecution is expected to begin itscross-examination of him. He is likely to be challenged inparticular over his explanation on Wednesday on why his 1999tax return omitted a $25 million payment that was usedto forgive a loan from Tyco. He matter of factlysaid the omission was a mistake.Kozlowski's decision to testify -- a choice that is fraught withrisk -- gave members of the jury their first chanceto hear directly from the man whom they have satacross from for nearly four months. Speaking in his trademarksqueaky, nasal voice, which seems at odds with his physicallyimposing appearance, Kozlowski and his lawyers may be hoping thatputting him on the stand will humanize him and allowhim to directly answer the charges against him.""Once a defendant decides to testify, in many senses everything thatcame before it in the trial becomes irrelevant,"" said JonathanPolkes, a partner at Weil Gotshal & Manges and aformer federal prosecutor. ""If the jury likes and believes thedefendant, the jury will be inclined to acquit. If theydon't, they'll be inclined to convict.""Kozlowksi and Tyco's former chief financial officer, Mark H. Swartz, areaccused of stealing $150 million by improperly forgiving company loansto themselves and awarding themselves unauthorized bonuses. They are alsoaccused of profiting illegally by selling $575 million worth ofTyco stock whose value they had artificially inflated.In choosing to put Kozlowski on the stand, his lawyers mayhave been encouraged by interviews with jurors after the firsttrial, who had commented that their impression of Kozlowski hadchanged for the better after they viewed a snippet ofhim speaking on a videotape of the now infamous $2million birthday party for his wife in Sardinia that waspartially paid for with Tyco funds. The jurors said theywere fascinated by how out-of-place Kozlowski seemed at the partyand his unpretentious demeanor. The most famous of those jurors,Ruth Jordan, Juror No. 4, who had held out foran acquittal, made a much noticed appearance in court onWednesday, taking a seat in the back row after lunch.She drew more attention by the throng of camera crewsthat assembled outside of the courthouse than even Kozlowski.Kozlowski may have also felt he needed to testify because theprosecution, so far, has appeared to put on a substantiallystronger, more focused case this time around. During the firsttrial, jurors said they were put off by the prosecution'soften meandering and disorganized presentation that focused as much attentionon his lavish spending as it did on the criminalcharges.Kozlowski's lawyer, Stephen Kaufman, spent much of the morning having himrecite his rags-to-riches story. Kozlowski, 58, told the jury howhe grew up in Newark, N.J., played guitar in aband to make money in high school (he said hewas a horrible guitar player but was good at bookinggigs), went to Seton Hall University, was married to awoman from the Bronx and was paid $28,000 a yearwhen he started at Tyco as an accountant in theearly 1970s.He then outlined his credentials, testifying that revenue at Tyco wasabout $20 million when he arrived and had grown to$40 billion by the time he left the huge conglomeratein June 2002.Kozlowski also explained a crucial part of the defense's case --thatTyco's compensation committee, and specifically its leader Phillip V. Hampton-- had approved the bonuses in question. Hampton died ofcancer in 2001. Several of Tyco's directors on the compensationcommittee have testified that the bonuses were not approved.Kozlowski described Hampton as a mentor and the man who hadhelped him become chief executive. ""He covered my back atthe organization,"" Kozlowski said. He recounted several conversations in whichhe insisted that Hampton had given him explicit permission toforgive the loans in question. At one point, he recalleda conversation with Hampton in which Kozlowski told him thatthe year's bonuses were going to be huge and hesuggested that instead of paying them in full, the bonusesbe partially used to pay off loans. ""The numbers aregoing to be big, embarrassingly big,"" he said he toldHampton, whom Kozlowski said signed off on the plan.Hoping to take the heat out of perhaps the prosecution's strongestpiece of evidence -- that a $25 million payment wasabsent from his 1999 tax return, Kozlowski just apologized. ""Icannot explain why,"" he said. ""I was not thinking whenI signed my tax return.""He said he never noticed the money because it was forgivenessof a company loan and he never received a checkfor it. Seeming almost embarrassed, he said that it waspart of a pay package that year that amounted tomore than $60 million, much of which he had deferredfor tax purposes. Furthermore, he insisted, his accountant and anadministrator missed the omission as well.He portrayed himself in his testimony as a busy executive witha punishing schedule and endless commitments that often put himon the road and consumed his attention, forcing him todelegate the details to others. He added that he trustedthe company's day-to-day operations to others and preferred to delegaterather than delve into details.Asked if he had a computer in his office, he replied,""Yes, but just for show.""
L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief executive ofTyco International, parried a barrage of tough questions during cross-examinationon Thursday, at times appearing to frustrate an increasingly incensedprosecutor by calmly and consistently agreeing with her.""Tyco's money was not your money to spend on yourself asyou pleased, was it?"" the prosecutor, Ann Donnelly, asked Kozlowski,clearly trying to agitate him.""That's correct,"" Kozlowski nonchalantly replied.""Where did the buck stop?"" she continued.""The buck stops with me with everything at Tyco,"" he saidin state Supreme Court in Manhattan.Sitting calmly on the witness stand for nearly four hours, Kozlowski,who is accused, along with the company's chief financial officer,of looting the company of $150 million by secretly forgivingloans they had received, acknowledged that mistakes had been madein disclosing some payments in government and tax filings. Buthe said they were innocent mistakes and the payments wereproperly authorized bonuses.While Kozlowski admitted many of the prosecution's assertions about how themoney was used, he consistently said that he never intendedto commit a crime because all the loans, which hesays were approved by the board, were ""in the recordsand books of the company,"" as he explained at onepoint.During the last portion of his direct testimony, he said thathe had typically tried to pay off his loans atthe end of every year.He also said that when he left Tyco in June 2002,he owed the company about $16 million in outstanding loans,but the company held about $80 million in compensation hehad deferred.Still, his most difficult testimony came when he was confronted withhis W-2 form from 1999, which omitted $25 million thatTyco had forgiven him. Again, Kozlowski agreed with Donnelly. ""Iabsolutely agree that the $25 million belonged on my W-2that was prepared by Tyco,"" he said. ""The numbers werebig; I had a lot of money in deferred income,""he said as in way of explanation. He said healso earned about $38 million, which he deferred, and asa result, it was not taxed.Donnelly, seeming almost exasperated, pressed him further. ""It's your testimony thatyou did not notice that $25 million was missing?"" sheasked. ""That is absolutely my testimony,"" he said.Kozlowski later told jurors that his tax bill for that yearwas $9.6 million. Had the $25 million been included, hesaid, he would have owed the government about $17.5 million.Kozlowski is not charged in this trial with evading the tax,but prosecutors hope to use the W-2 form as evidencethat he tried to conceal that payment.Donnelly also displayed minutes from a 1999 Tyco compensation committee meetingwhere Kozlowski's pay was approved. ""There is no section inthese minutes that gives you $25 million in loan forgiveness,is there?"" she asked.""No,"" he said. He later said she misused the term ""loanforgiveness.""""Ms. Donnelly, I was given a bonus, and instead of takingthe cash bonus, I was paying down debt to thecompany,"" he said.Donnelly spent much of the afternoon questioning Kozlowski about his useof two of Tyco's loan programs, which he is accusedof misusing. Kozlowski used the two programs, one to helpemployees pay relocation costs and another to help them paytaxes on restricted stock grants, to pay for an assortmentof items that fell outside of those purposes. He didnot deny that the loans were used for purposes otherthan the ones described. ""I thought I was authorized,"" hesaid.The program had been used for other purposes by other executivessince the 1970s, he said, ""long before I was CEOof the company, well before I was an officer.""Kozlowski also said that the decision to use the loan programinstead of his own money for certain payments was typicallymade not by him, but by an assistant at thecompany who was in charge of his personal finances.""So you are saying that it was the responsibility of CathyMcRae, who ran your personal affairs, to decide whether ornot she should use Tyco money for your personal investment?""Donnelly asked.""The responsibility of my personal affairs were mine,"" he said. ""Shehad the authority to manage my personal affairs and makedecisions within that sphere of responsibility.""He added: ""Cathy did make some decisions whether she would pullfrom the Key Employee Loan that I was entitled to,or whether she would write a check from one ofmy banks.""At one point, Kozlowski came under fire after acknowledging that hehad said he did not know the $25 million hereceived was used to pay down an employee loan, insteadof his relocation account balance.""Ms. Donnelly, it may seem inconceivable to you that I maynot know how that happened,"" he said. ""I am responsiblefor what I owe Tyco. I take full responsibility forthat. But to sit down and to track the loanson a day-in and day-out basis, to reconcile loans, tomake wire transfers, to take care of the things thatI was doing, that responsibility I delegated to somebody else,simply because I was the chief executive officer of Tycoand, you know, I was doing many, many other thingsat that time.""Kozlowski was also shown proxy materials and annual reports from certainyears that described the loan programs in explicit terms, unlikethose from several other years in which the terms wereslightly vaguer.Donnelly asked Kozlowski, who is also accused of securities fraud, whetherit was his responsibility to make sure the proxy wasaccurate when he signed it. ""I'm not skirting my signingresponsibility, but in my becoming chief executive officer of Tyco,I relied upon the experts in the field of proxypreparation and SEC law to appropriately represent that which neededto be disclosed for Tyco and that which did notneed to be disclosed for Tyco,"" he said. ""Still, I'multimately responsible.""
During his first two days on the witnessstand, L. Dennis Kozlowski appeared calm as he parried aseries of tough questions. On Monday, things turned decidedly morecontentious as he faced accusations that he misused company fundsfor lavish living and lied about it on the stand.Kozlowski, former chief executive of Tyco International, and Mark H. Swartz,his former chief financial officer, are facing charges that theylooted the company of $150 million by secretly forgiving millionsof dollars of loans to themselves and others, without boardapproval. He has contended that the board approved bonuses thatwere used to forgive the loans.In a fiery exchange at the end of the day, Kozlowski'skey testimony -- that he had received verbal approval formillions of dollars of bonuses from the head of thecompensation committee, Philip Hampton, who has since died from cancer-- was challenged during a heated cross-examination.""It is true, it is a fact you never had anyconversation with Phil Hampton about you and your co-defendant getting37-and-a-half million dollars in 1999, did you?"" Ann Donnelly, anassistant district attorney, asked derisively.""I had conversations with Phil Hampton in 1999, in 2000, yes.I did,"" Kozlowski responded, clearly agitated.""You never had any conversation with Phil Hampton in which heknew you and your co-defendant were taking $24 million, didyou?"" Donnelly continued.""That is totally untrue,"" Kozlowski answered.The cross examination in the trial-level state Supreme Court in Manhattan,which ended Monday -- redirect examination begins Tuesday -- oftenput Kozlowski on the defensive. While he frequently appeared composed,there were points in his testimony at which he challengedDonnelly. At other times, he appeared unable to answer certainquestions, responding by saying, ""I can't recall"" or ""I don'tremember.""Donnelly spent much of the afternoon asking about Kozlowski's prolific spendingof the company's money. She asked him whether using $1million of Tyco's money on an elaborate trip in Sardinia,Italy, at which a birthday party was held for Kozlowski'swife, was consistent with a statement in the company's annualreport that called for ""a relentless push to cut costs.""Kozlowski responded: ""There was a relentless effort to cut costs, butwe also spent some money on employees to keep themmotivated and to hopefully reward them, especially their spouses whogave up an awful lot of time with Tyco employees.""Donnelley zeroed in on an $18 million apartment on Fifth Avenuethat Kozlowski had the company buy, and an additional $12million of company money that was used to renovate anddecorate the apartment. Kozlowski, who said a decorator he hiredhad ""overspent,"" acknowledged: ""I did not oversee this in themanner in which I should have overseen that apartment. Iwas doing other things and I should have been focusedon the amount of money being spent there. I takeresponsibility for that.""Calling some of the decorations ""god-awful"" and telling jurors that ""Istuffed some of it in the closet,""' he added: ""Ialso felt that the asset was going to improve --appreciate for Tyco -- and I was given assurances bythe decorator that the antiques and things that she putinto that apartment were of ultimate value and should appreciatein value. And those items belong to Tyco.""He said he rarely used the apartment and treated it likea hotel: ""I used the apartment for business meetings andto sleep there when I was in town on Tycobusiness."" Calling the apartment ""a Tyco facility,"" and saying hiswife slept there only two times (""Her clothing might havebeen there, but she wasn't,"" he said). He insisted hedid not consider it a home, describing home as ""aplace where you live, where you may have your familydog."" He kept homes in Boca Raton, Fla., and Nantucket,Mass., he said.Kozlowski also defended using more than $10 million of Tyco moneyon expensive artwork, including a Monet and a Renoir, sayingthat they were assets of the company and that hethought he had negotiated a good deal to buy them.Describing how an agent went back and forth with aLondon art dealer to negotiate a deal for one ofthe paintings, he said, ""It's just like buying a car-- a very, very expensive car.""Donnelly, trying to mock him, questioned his motives for later wantingto sell the art, challenging an answer he gave inwhich he said he felt he could not move theart to his house in Boca Raton because his wifehad security concerns.""Didn't Tyco own ADT?"" Donnelly shot back, referring to the securityalarm company.""We had a security system,"" Kozlowski said. ""People know how toget around those from time to time.""
","Prosecutors changed tactics in the retrial of Kozlowski and Swartz from accusations of lavish spending used in the first trial, to a focus on charges that Kozlowski and Swartz had awarded themselves millions of dollars and concealed it from the board of Tyco. A retired board chairman testified he was never told about millions in forgiven loans and bonuses for the two executives. Tyco's former head of finance testified he never saw that millions of dollars in special bonuses were approved by a compensation committee. The VP of finance also said he wasn't aware of any documents to that effect. ","In the prosecution's case, former Tyco executives were questioned, sometimes for days, about their knowledge or lack thereof about loans forgiven and bonuses paid to Dennis Kozlowski. On April 27, he took the stand in his defense. He denied abusing company loans and bonuses, testifying that the compensation committee leader, who has since died, approved them. He did admit to forgetfully omitting $25 million bonus that did not appear on his 1999 tax return. Cross-examination, which began on April 28, turned decidedly contentious by the third day. Kozlowski maintained his innocence and defended his lavish spending throughout. ","Prosecutors in the trial of Kozlowski and Swartz say the two stole $150M by improperly forgiving company loans to themselves, taking unauthorized bonuses and having Tyco pay personal expenses. In a surprise move, Kozlowski testified in his own defense. He portrayed himself as an earnest, often harried, executive who rose through the ranks and had the support of the company's board. He could not explain why a $25M bonus did not appear on his tax return. Kozlowski finished four days of testimony insisting that he left it to lawyers and accountants to decide what to tell shareholders about his compensation. ",The retired Tyco board chairman said he was never told about millions in forgiven loans and bonuses for Kozlowski. The former finance VP said he was unaware of compensation committee approval for the bonuses. Kozlowski took the stand in his retrial. He said deceased compensation committee head Phillip Hampton had approved the bonuses. Kozlowski thought a $20 million fee he paid a board member for arranging an acquisition did not require board authorization. Not including forgiven debt on his tax form was an oversight. His assistant decided to use Tyco loan money for certain payments but Kozlowski conceded his responsibility. 
D0929,D0929-A,"World oil prices fell further on Tuesday, despite a new hurricane powering towards oil facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, and as OPEC pledged to supply more crude from the start of October if required.Hurricane Rita was upgraded from a tropical storm as it threatened the southeastern United States, forcing an alert in southern Florida and scuttling plans to repopulate New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina turned it into a ghost city three weeks earlier.The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, meanwhile, pledged to make an extra two million more barrels per day available to oil markets from October 1 if there were adequate demand, while holding its official production ceiling at 28  million barrels per day.New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in October, which lapses later Tuesday, sank 1.09 dollars to 66.30 dollars per barrel during early trading.In London, the price of Brent North Sea crude for November delivery lost 1.29 dollars to 64.32 dollars per barrel.Crude futures extended earlier losses, made on profit taking, after surging more than four dollars on Monday as Rita looked set to reach hurricane strength over the oil-rich Gulf Coast.
Hurricane Rita strengthened to category two, packing winds of 160 kilometers per hour (100 mph) early Tuesday afternoon, the Miami-based National Weather Center announced.The storm headed from Atlantic waters off Cuba toward the Gulf of Mexico and was expected to pass about 65 kilometers (40 miles) off Key West, the southernmost city in a chain of islands linked to mainland Florida by a single bridge.Forecasters warned that once it hits the warm Gulf of Mexico waters, Rita could gain further strength and reach category three on the five-level Saffir-Simpson hurricane intensity scale.
Iberia and American Airlines said Tuesday they were suspending flights between Madrid and Miami because of Hurricane Rita.Both companies told AFP they were awaiting information from US authorities before deciding to restore the flights. The Miami-based National Weather Center said the hurricane strengthened Tuesday, packing winds of 160 kilometers per hour (100 mph).

More than 7,000 Hurricane Katrina survivors taking refuge in Texas shelters were being uprooted again Tuesday as Hurricane Rita threatened the state neighboring Louisiana, officials said.About 4,000 refugees from Louisiana housed in a shelter in Houston, Texas, are being moved to Arkansas, while 3,000 more are moving from a San Antonio refuge to Tennessee, said David Passey, a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) spokesman.Texas is also looking for states to house 360 refugees currently in Corpus Christi, Passey told reporters in Baton Rouge, in the state of Louisiana devastated by Katrina on August 29.More than 13,000 Katrina survivors are in Texas shelters, but authorities are only moving those located in vulnerable areas, he said.""Texas right now bears the greatest threat from Hurricane Rita,"" Passey said. ""Today, the state of Texas is working with other states to evacuate the remaining Louisiana residents to other places.""He said he did not know how long the refugees would have to stay in the new shelters. Authorities began relocating them by bus and plane Tuesday, Passey said.Hundreds of thousands of people were forced from their homes by Katrina, which has left nearly 1,000 people dead. Nearly 97,000 Katrina survivors are being housed in shelters across the United States, according to figures released Tuesday.Hurricane Rita barreled near southern Florida islands and headed toward the Gulf of Mexico, threatening Texas and Louisiana with winds of 160 kilometers per hour (100 mph).
Emergency services began evacuating residents of hurricane-ravaged New Orleans once again Tuesday due to the threat posed by Hurricane Rita, Mayor Ray Nagin said.""We have had an influx of evacuees that have made their way to the convention center. We've already evacuated two busloads of individuals,"" Nagin said as Rita barreled near southernmost Florida, heading west on a track that could take it close to the devastated Louisiana city.
Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco declared a state of emergency in western Louisiana on Tuesday and urged people to evacuate as strengthening Hurricane Rita headed toward the Gulf of Mexico.""I have put the state on alert. We've declared another emergency for particularly at this moment for southwest Louisiana,"" Blanco said.""We're urging people to evacuate,"" she told a press conference as Rita barreled near southernmost Florida, heading west on a track that could take it close to the devastated Louisiana city.
The Texas coastal county of Galveston will order a mandatory evacuation on Wednesday in preparation for Hurricane Rita, the office of emergency management said Tuesday.A county judge said he is planning on issuing a mandatory evacuation of nursing homes and assisted-living facilities beginning at 6:00 am (9:00 GMT) Wednesday, with a mandatory evacuation of the general population beginning at 6:00 pm (2100 GMT) and continuing through Thursday afternoon.Local schools have already closed and government offices will be closed Wednesday amid fears the hurricane could strike the region.Hurricane Rita pounded the fragile Florida Keys islands Tuesday as it barreled toward the oil-rich Gulf of Mexico.Those wishing to enter the county to check on their boats or summer houses were warned to do so no later than noon on Wednesday as all traffic will be directed northbound after mandatory evacuation begins.Shelters have been set up in three nearby towns and pets will be allowed in the shelters, officials said. Many Louisiana residents were deterred from staying in a shelter during the deadly Hurricane Katrina because they did not want to abandon their pets.Located just south of Houston, the county of Galveston is home to some 267,000 people.
Hurricane Rita brushed past Key West on Tuesdayand was forecast to strengthen into a major hurricane laterin the week, prompting residents and rescuers to begin evacuatingthis feeble city, as well as parts of Louisiana andTexas.From the tip of the Florida peninsula to Galveston, Texas, thousandsleft their homes or made plans to, including many whohad already fled once, from Hurricane Katrina, and were livingin shelters and temporary housing. In Houston, officials began movingevacuees from New Orleans out of the Reliant Arena wherethey had found refuge and sending many of them onto Arkansas.In Louisiana, Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco asked President Bush on Tuesdayto declare a state of emergency for her battered stateas it prepares for Hurricane Rita. She requested $10 millionin assistance.Churning undiminished toward the warm and wide Gulf of Mexico, HurricaneRita could strengthen to Category 4 intensity as it approachesTexas later this week, said Colin McAdie, a meteorologist atthe National Hurricane Center in Miami. Hurricane Katrina was aCategory 4 storm when it devastated parts of the coastsof Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama on Aug. 29.McAdie said western Louisiana could also bear the brunt of thestorm depending on changes in steering currents. ""It's better notto nail it down too precisely,"" he said. ""Over thenext day or so we'll have a better idea.""The official death toll in Louisiana remained at 736. In Mississippi,219 people died from the storm.In the city, mostly empty of residents but with its physicalcore still vulnerable, the possibility of heavy rain and astorm surge prompted officials to make emergency efforts to bolsterits weakened levee system, station 500 buses on its outskirtsto evacuate remaining residents and establish a military hospital atthe convention center, which just weeks ago was the sceneof violence and desperation for thousands of trapped evacuees fromHurricane Katrina.
An evacuation order was issuedMonday for Florida Keys as a tropical storm is moving quickly towards the southern US island chain.The order will prompt the evacuation of some 40,000 residents and tourists in the Atlantic archipelago near southeastern US mainland, US TV network CNN reported.According to latest weather reports, Tropical Storm Rita is sustaining winds of 97 kph earlier Monday, and is likely to be upgraded to a level 1 hurricane by the time it passes the Florida Keys.Earlier, Florida Governor Jeb Bush on Sunday declared a state of emergency for his state which includes the island chain of Florida Keys.His order will give the state authority to oversee evacuations and activate the National Guard.US National Hurricane Center Director Max Mayfield warned that people in some areas still recovering from Hurricane Katrina should be watching Rita.""This is definitely becoming a concern for the northwestern Gulf of Mexico,"" he said, noting that Rita could pose a threat to Texas and Louisiana within days.Rita is the 17th named storm of this year's Atlantic hurricane season, which started June 1 and will end Nov. 30.It is also the third tropical system to emerge from the Atlantic in two weeks.Tropical Storm Phillippe was upgraded to a hurricane Sunday night, while Tropical Storm Ophelia was fading into the North Atlantic.
","Tropical storm Rita appeared likely to be upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane before passing the Florida Keys. Florida Governor declared a state of emergency enabling him to oversee evacuations and activate the National Guard. The US National Hurricane Center warned that Rita could threaten Texas and Louisiana within days. Louisiana Governor declared a state of emergency. New Orleans worked to bolster weakened levees and establish a military hospital. Rita was upgraded to Category 2 and expected to reach Category 3 in the Gulf. Along the Gulf coast refugees were relocated, schools and offices were closed and evacuations were mandated. ","An evacuation order was issued Monday for the Florida keys as Tropical Storm Rita approached and is likely to be upgraded to a level one hurricane. Rita brushed past Key West Tuesday and was forecast to strengthen to a major hurricane, possibly a category 4, later in the week. Once again, New Orleans implemented emergency services and some individuals were evacuated. Hurricane Katrina survivors taking refuge in Texas were being uprooted again as Rita threatened. Texas now bears the greatest threat from Rita. The Texas coastal county of Galveston will order a mandatory evacuation on Wednesday in preparation of Rita. ","Monday, Rita became a Category 1 hurricane. Tuesday it increased to a Cat2 and a Cat3 or 4 was feared. Florida declared a state of emergency and residents of the Keys began evacuating. Those remaining were advised to hunker down. In New Orleans, levee system repairs were underway, buses were on stand-by, a military hospital was established, and evacuations began. Katrina refugees in Texas were being moved out of state. A mandatory evacuation on Wednesday of Galveston, Texas, was ordered and shelters set up. Madrid to Miami flights were suspended and crude futures rose. OPEC promised additional crude if needed. ","As Hurricane Rita moved toward the Florida Keys on Sunday 18 September, the Florida governor declared a state of emergency. Monday, residents and tourists were told to evacuate the Florida Keys. By early Tuesday afternoon, Rita had strengthened to a category two storm, with winds of 100 mph and was expected to gain further strength and reach a category three as it hit the warm Gulf of Mexico waters. Residents of New Orleans were evacuating and the Louisiana Governor declared a state of emergency in western Louisiana. Galveston was expected to order a mandatory evacuation on Wednesday 21 September. "
D0929,D0929-B,"Oil prices were higher in Asian trade Wednesday as Hurricane Rita pounded the Florida Keys islands before barreling into the Gulf of Mexico where much of US production is sourced, dealers said.At 12:30 pm (0430 GMT), New York's main contract, light sweet crude for November delivery, was up 1.28 dollars at 67.48 dollars a barrel from its close of 66.20 dollars in the United States Tuesday.""Now it is all about Hurricane Rita,"" said Victor Shum, an analyst with US energy consultancy Purvin and Gertz in Singapore.""That is driving up prices at the moment,"" he said.Rita, expected to become a major storm, was tracking a path that could roughly follow that of Hurricane Katrina into the Gulf of Mexico where about one-quarter of US oil operations are based.The path, while still uncertain, could take the powerful new storm toward Texas or possibly Louisiana, where it would likely inflict further damage on the US energy industry.Gulf of Mexico production has only been starting to recover from the shutdown caused by Katrina late last month.Now with Rita approaching, more than 58 percent of crude oil drilling and about 35 percent of natural gas production has been suspended, according to US government figures Tuesday.The US government also said 46 oil platforms had been destroyed by Katrina and 20 severely damaged while several refineries remain shut.Just the fear of Rita moving into the region sparked a jump of about seven percent in crude oil futures on Monday, while gasoline futures spiked 14.4 percent. There was some pullback in prices Tuesday but the markets remained nervous.""There are many facilities around Houston, especially natural gas facilities, offshore rigs and underground pipeline systems,"" said Mike Fitzpatrick, analyst at Fimat USA.
US meteorologists on Wednesday upgraded Hurricane Rita, which roared into the oil-rich Gulf of Mexico after slamming Cuba and the Florida Keys islands, to a more powerful Category Three category on the five-level hurricane intensity scale.At 0600 GMT Wednesday Rita packed winds of 185 kilometers (115 miles) per hour, officials at the Miami-based National Hurricane Center reported.""Additional strengthening is forecast during the next 24 hours,"" the Hurricane Center said in an advisory, ""and Rita is expected to become a Category Four hurricane sometime later (Wednesday).""Rita's center was located some 235 kilometers (145 miles) west of Key West, Florida, and about 210 kilometers (130 miles) northwest of Havana, and was moving west in the direction of the Texas coastline at a speed of around 22 kilometers (14 miles) per hour, according to the Hurricane Center.The hurricane left more than 24,000 homes without power in Florida, sent street signs and coconuts flying and flooded parts of the only road that links the Florida Keys to the mainland.Cuba set up 600 shelters in Havana and Civil Defense reported 230,000 evacuees, including 12,000 foreigners in the tourist area of Varadero. Hurricane warnings were in effect around Havana and western provinces.In Louisiana, still recovering from Hurricane Katrina's August 29 hit, authorities were keeping a close eye on Rita, and New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin suspended the return of the city's residents because of the new threat.
World oil prices made strong gains on Wednesday, as Hurricane Rita threatened fresh damage to energy facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, analysts said.New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in November climbed 1.12 dollars to 67.32 dollars per barrel in electronic trading.The October contract expired Tuesday at 66.23 dollars per barrel.In London, the price of Brent North Sea crude for November delivery gained 94 cents to 65.14 dollars per barrel.Concern over Rita had boosted oil prices by more than four dollars on Monday, before they slid a day later on profit-taking.Rita was tracking a path that could roughly follow that of recent Hurricane Katrina into the Gulf of Mexico where about one-quarter of US oil operations are based.Traders were meanwhile awaiting the latest weekly snapshot of US crude inventories, whose publication later Wednesday would show the extent to which stockpiles were recovering following the destruction to rigs and refineries caused by Katrina late last month.""The market is now concerned that Hurricane Rita could extend the time that these facilities are offline for and even cause fresh damage,"" Sucden analyst Sam Tilley said.""The market will also be watching the US crude inventory figures,"" he added. 
British energy giant BP said on Wednesday that it was evacuating staff from Gulf of Mexico oil facilities, after a similar move by Royal Dutch Shell, as Hurricane Rita approached the region.""We have evacuated all non-essential personnel to ensure their safety,"" a BP spokeswoman said.BP said it has removed half of its 1,500 employees working at its offshore facilities in the eastern and central parts of the Gulf.Anglo-Dutch energy giant Royal Dutch Shell has meanwhile removed some 545 staff from its platforms since Sunday.""We will continue to monitor the situation closely and respond to further developments,"" a Royal Dutch Shell statement said.Rita -- which strengthened to hurricane status on Tuesday -- was tracking a path that could roughly follow that of recent Hurricane Katrina into the Gulf of Mexico, where about one-quarter of US oil operations are based.
Hurricane Rita, already an ""extremely dangerous"" storm continued to gain strength Wednesday and could reach top intensity before it hits land, probably in Texas, the US National Hurricane Center said.""Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 140 mph (224 kilometers per hour) with higher gusts,"" said Lixion Avila, a forecaster with the Miami-based NHC.""Rita is an extremely dangerous category four hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Some additional strengthening is forecast during the next 24 hours and could reach category five intensity in the central Gulf of Mexico,"" he said.Forecasters believe the storm will make landfall in Texas over the weekend, but do not rule out it may hit further east on the Louisiana coast.
Houston Mayor Bill White on Wednesday urged residents in low lying areas to leave the path of powerful Hurricane Rita as it churned toward Texas.""Hurricane Rita on its present course poses a risk to Houston and the whole Houston region,"" White told a press conference in Texas.""We are asking all residents in the Houston area and the greater Houston area that are in the storm surge area for a hurricane of this force and above to begin making their evacuation plans.""We are calling for volunteer evacuations from several different areas. First, those areas that are in the storm surge areas. ""Second, if you are in a 100-year flood plain, in an area that has experienced flooding in the past, those include many areas along some of the major bayou waterways. We want you to voluntarily evacuate and make your plans for voluntary evacuations now and implement those plans.""He also urged those in mobile homes to evacuate.Rita, packing winds of 215 kilometers (135 miles) per hour, was upgraded to a category-four storm on the five-level Saffir-Simpson intensity scale as it bore down on Texas, where inhabitants of Galveston were ordered to flee the city.
Texas officials on Wednesday urged voluntary evacuations of residents from areas that could lie in the path of powerful Hurricane Rita as it churned ominously toward their state.""Though Rita may weaken to a Category Four storm from that Category Five by the time it hits the shore, it is quite likely it will be a devastating storm when it reaches Texas. That's why I'm encouraging coastal residents from Corpus Christi to Beaumont area to voluntarily evacuate if they have the means,"" Texas Governor Rick Perry said.President George W. Bush meanwhile urged people to heed local authorities' evacuation orders.""Mandatory evacuations have been ordered for New Orleans and Galveston. I urge the citizens to listen carefully to the instructions provided by state and local authorities. And follow them,"" Bush said.""We hope and pray that Hurricane Rita will not be a devastating storm. But we got to be ready for the worst.""Rita, the second big hurricane in less than four weeks, has strengthened to a category four storm on the five level Saffir-Simpson scale and is headed toward the US Gulf Coast.The death toll from last month's Hurricane Katrina rose above 1,000 Wednesday as 63 more bodies have been recovered in Louisiana, authorities said in Baton Rouge.Houston Mayor Bill White on Wednesday urged residents in low lying areas to leave Rita's striking range.""Hurricane Rita on its present course poses a risk to Houston and the whole Houston region,"" White told a press conference in Texas.""We are asking all residents in the Houston area and the greater Houston area that are in the storm surge area for a hurricane of this force and above to begin making their evacuation plans.""We are calling for volunteer evacuations from several different areas.

We've been preparing for this type of event for a number of years. We have run a great many training exercises for an event such as this.""We reevaluated and we have improved our hurricane preparedness plans after Florida was hit four times in one year. We are doing everything we can to prepare for this storm,"" the Texas governor said.
More than 70 percent of US oil production in the Gulf of Mexico has been shut down because of the threat of Hurricane Rita and the aftermath of Katrina, authorities reported Wednesday.More than 57 percent of manned offshore plaforms and 51 percent of rigs in the area were evacuated, the Department of Interior's Minerals Service (MMS) said.""Todays shut-in oil production is 1,097,357 BOPD (barrels of oil per day),"" MMS said, adding that this represented 73.16 percent of the US production of 1.5 million barrels per day in the Gulf of Mexico.A total of 469 manned platforms, out of 819, and 69 of the 134 rigs were evacuated.MMS said the statistics reflected evacuations and shut-in production from both Katrina and Rita.
US President George W. Bush declared on Wednesday a state of emergency in Texas and Louisiana,at a time when both states were bracing for Hurricane Rita, the White House said.Rita, which picked up strength and has turned into a Category-5hurricane, could slam Texas by the weekend and bring floodwater toNew Orleans, which was battered by Hurricane Katrina just over three weeks ago.As many as 1 million people were ordered to evacuate along the Gulf Coast, and hospital and nursing home patients were evacuated Wednesday.Meanwhile, the death toll from Katrina along the Gulf Coast rose over 1,000 Wednesday to 1,036. The Louisiana state Health Department updated fatalities in the state to 799.
Hurricane Rita gained strengthon its way towards the US Gulf Coast and turned into a Category 5 storm Wednesday afternoon, forcing authorities to order the evacuation of more than 1.3 million residents in the region.The hurricane, with winds up to 165 mph (264 kmp), was forecastto land somewhere along the Texas Gulf Coast between Galveston andCorpus Christi Saturday. Texas Governor Rick Perry has urged residents along the state's entire coast to begin evacuating.A similar evacuation order was issued in New Orleans of Louisiana, which was battered by Hurricane just three weeks ago leaving 799 people dead as of Wednesday. The total number of deathfrom Katrina along the Gulf Coast rose past 1,000 to 1,037.Category 5 is the highest on the five-level hurricane intensityscale, and only three Category 5 hurricanes are known to have hit the US mainland.To prepare for a potential catastrophe as that caused by Katrina, authorities have mobilized an estimated 319,000 National Guard troops nationwide to respond to Rita if needed.""We hope and pray that Hurricane Rita will not be a devastatingstorm, but we got to be ready for the worst,"" said US President George W. Bush on Wednesday, who has declared a state of emergencyin Texas and Louisiana.
","Hurricane Rita was upgraded to a Category 3 after slamming Cuba and the Florida Keys. She packed a wind of 115 mph. Rita was upgraded to an extremely dangerous category 4 hurricane as it bore down on Texas. In the Gulf of Mexico Rita gained strength to a category 5 hurricane. One million people evacuated the Gulf Coast. Cuba set up 600 shelters in Havana housing 230000 evacuees. Oil companies evacuated staff from the Gulf as hurricane Rita approached, shutting down over 70 percent of US oil production in the area. ","Rita, expected to become a major storm, is tracking a path that could follow that of Katrina. By Wednesday, Rita was upgraded to category three. President Bush declared a state of emergency in Texas and Louisiana as those states were bracing for Rita. As many as one million people were ordered to evacuate along the Gulf Coast. Rita was expected to land somewhere along the Texas gulf coast between Galveston and Corpus Christi and Texas Governor Perry has urged residents to begin evacuating. It poses a risk to the entire Houston region and has been upgraded to category four. ","On Wednesday, Rita was upgraded to a Cat3 and reached a Cat5 by the afternoon. Cuba had shelters for 230,000 evacuees. President Bush declared a state of emergency in Texas and Louisiana. More residents of the Gulf coast were ordered to evacuate. Rita is aimed at Houston, where residents of the 100-year flood plain, storm surge areas, and mobile homes were urged to leave. About 319,000 National Guard troops have been mobilized. More than 70% of US oil production in the Gulf stopped, as crude oil prices rose. The Texas governor speculated Rita could become a Cat4 before landfall. ","On Wednesday, with winds of 115 mph, Rita was upgraded to a level three hurricane. Royal Dutch Shell and BP evacuated all non-essential personnel from off-shore facilities. Later that day the storm was upgraded to a category five with winds of 165 mph. A state of emergency was declared in Texas and Louisiana. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for New Orleans and Galveston; over one million people along the coast were asked to evacuate voluntarily. About 320,000 National Guard troops were mobilized. The path of the hurricane was still uncertain, but it was expected to hit Texas or Louisiana. "
D0930,D0930-A,"Less than a decade ago, the idea of capturing and storing the carbon gases blamed for driving the Earth towards climate-change peril was usually dismissed with a laugh.But a top scientific forum here shows how far the argument for carbon sequestration has come, with a series of experts insisting it can be transformed from fiction to fact.Driving their case is the fear that time is running out for dealing cheaply with the carbon pollution spewed out by fossil fuels.These emissions trap the Sun's heat and disrupt Earth's fragile climate system, with potentially catastrophic effects a few decades from now.Their focus is on power stations which burn oil, gas and coal, and whose pollution is set to soar in coming years as China and India, the two world's most populous countries, meet surging needs for energy.Sequestrators say carbon dioxide (CO2) would be captured using solvents, either before or after the fossil fuel is burned in the plant.The CO2 would then be pumped out, sometimes over hundreds of kilometers (miles), to disused oil and gas fields up to one kilometer (3,250 feet) underground, and stored.It would not be the miracle cure to global warming or switch off the dependence on fossil fuels that are the source of the problem, they admit.Even so, ""it can play a global role, making very large and very rapid reductions of CO2 emissions,"" Jon Gibbins of Imperial College London said on Thursday.He pointed to a pilot scheme in the North Sea as proof of its feasibility.An experiment in Norway's offshore field, Sleipner, has been storing a million tonnes of waste CO2 per year since 1996, pumping it 1,000 metres (3,250 feet) below a cap of shale and mudstone.Another project is in North America, where CO2 is being extracted from a coalgas plant in Wyoming and pumped 300 kms (185 miles) to Weyburn, in Canada's Saskatchewan province, where it is stored in an empty underground chamber in a working oilfield.Environmentalists say the answer to global warming is to slash emissions themselves and swiftly wean the world off dirty fossils and onto renewable sources and hydrogen.They also warn that the stored carbon is simply a bequeathed hazard for future generations. If the geological storage tank leaks or is breached by an earthquake the outpouring of CO2 would instantly damage the world's climate system.Gibbins says former oil and gas fields in sedimentary basins, but also many types of water aquifers, are excellent options for safe storage: ""We are looking at 90 percent retention [of the gas] for 1,000 years.""Taking out the CO2 from fuel is called ""carbon neutral,"" in other words not adding further to emissions from that source.But a more ambitious possibility is ""carbon negative,"" or removing CO2 from the atmosphere.That could be done by biofuels, suggests Peter Read, a professor at Massey University in New Zealand.Plants suck CO2 out of the air as part of photosynthesis. By growing plants, burning them in fossil-fuel power stations and then sequestrating and storing the carbon, a dent could be made on ors would increase by 62 percent.During the same period, world electricity demand is projected to double, with fossil fuels supplying most of the need.The three-day conference, ending in this southwestern city on Thursday, focussed on scientists' latest assessment of the global warming problem.
Britain is to study whether global warming can be curbed by ""capturing"" carbon dioxode from power stations and storing it underground in old oil and gas fields, ministers said Tuesday.The government has committed 40 million pounds (60 million euros, 72 million dollars) for research on the technology, known as carbon sequestration, or carbon capture.The method should be operational within a decade and could eventually prove a major export earner for Britain as other countries begin to adopt climate change-reducing techniques, Energy Minister Malcolm Wicks said.The theory is that fossil fuel power stations, oil rigs and other energy burners would hold on to waste gases such as carbon dioxode and methane, rather than releasing them into the atmosphere.Carbon dioxode and methane are among what are known as greenhouse gases, increased concentrations of which in the earth's atmosphere have been blamed by scientists for global warming.Under the British plan, the captured gases would be pumped underground into spent oil and gas fields.""Reaching our ambitious target of cutting carbon emissions by 60 percent by 2050 means action now to support emerging technologies that will enable us to burn coal and gas more cleanly,"" Wicks told BBC radio,""At the same time, with major expansion of coal-fired power generation expected in China and India, we want to put the UK at the forefront of what could be a valuable new export opportunity.""Carbon capture could reduce emissions from power plants by up to 85 percent, he added.Tony Juniper, director of environmental group Friends of the Earth, welcomed the initiative but warned there were ""many challenges"" ahead.""First of all, are there enough geological deposits that can keep this gas out of the atmosphere for long enough to make a difference? Can we get it there effectively? Can we transport it in a way that is technically feasible?"" he told BBC radio.""And then, of course, what is going to be the cost of implementing this technology?""British Prime Minister Tony Blair has pledged to make tackling climate change one of the main priorities of next month's summit of the Group of Eight (G8) rich nations' club in Gleneagles, Scotland.
The G8 on Friday declared climate change a ""serious and long-term challenge,"" pointed a finger of blame at fossil fuels and looked to smart technology and cooperation with big emerging economies to tackle the problem.""Climate change is a serious and long-term challenge that has the potential to affect every part of the globe,"" the world's eight most powerful countries said in a declaration here at the end of their three-day summit.""We know that increased need and use of energy from fossil fuels, and other human activities, contribute in large part to increases in greenhouse gases associated with the warming of our Earth's surface.""""We know enough to act now to put ourselves on a path to slow and, as the science justifies, stop and then reverse the growth of greenhouse gases,"" they said, pledging to act ""with resolve and urgency.""The declaration was issued by the Group of Eight along with a ""Gleneagles Plan of Action"" for combatting global warming and promoting clean energy.The two documents marked the club's greatest acknowledgement so far about the cause and scale of global warming, a phenomenon that has shifted from the wings to the centre of the world's political stage in less than a quarter-century.And they succeeded in bridging a rift between the United States, the world's biggest single culprit for greenhouse gases, and the other G8 countries.They have fought for more than four years as to whether a voluntary approach or binding caps on pollution emissions are the best way to tackle global warming.British Prime Minister Tony Blair hailed the compromise as a big step forward.""If it isn't possible to bring America into the consensus on tackling the issue of climate change we will never ensure that the huge emerging economies, particularly those of China and India, who are going to consume more energy than any other part of the world, that they are part of a dialogue,"" Blair said.""And if we cannot have America as part of the dialogue on climate change and if we can't have India and China as part of a dialogue there is no possibility of us succeeding in resolving this issue.""But the deal fell miles short of the demands from scientists and green groups.They had demanded a deadline and a target for cuts in the fossil-fuel gases that are warming Earth's atmosphere and disrupting its climate system.""Thanks to the Bush administration, the world's biggest polluters have given little hope to those already suffering from climate change, especially those in Africa who will be hit hardest,"" said WWF's Jennifer Morgan.""Technology is important but without real targets to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, it is simply not enough.""The summit called for investment in clean energy technology, such as hydrogen, gave only a passing encouragement for renewables but a flourish of verbal support for technologies that greens say are dangerous or untested.These include ""clean"" coal and carbon sequestration, in which carbon dioxide gas is pumped into geological chambers and stored there, rather than released into the atmosphere when fossil fuels are burned in power stations. The summit also said it noted efforts to sustain and update nuclear power in those G8 countries which have a commitment to nuclear plants.References to the fast-growing mountain of scientific evidence, which say climate change is already happening and could be catastrophic, were absent.And mentions of the ""K word"" -- the Kyoto Protocol -- were pared to a minimum in deference to the United States. Talks on what happens after Kyoto runs out in 2012 start in November.""Let's be very clear,"" said Blair. ""We were never to be able at this G8 to resolve disagreement over Kyoto nor to renegotiate a set of targets for countries in place of the Kyoto Protocol.""US President George W. Bush is implacably hostile to the UN pact, saying it would cripple the US economy by its demands to curb fossil-fuel pollution, and is unfair because China and India are not included in the targeted emissions cuts.With that argument in mind, the summit declared it sought a ""dialogue"" with developing countries on tackling greenhouse gases that would be launched at a conference in Britain on November 1.Over the past four years, scientists have sounded ever-louder warnings about global warming.But these these alarms have run into political resistance and worries about the cost of greater energy efficiency and the switch to cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels.
Oil group BP PLC said Thursday it has formed a joint venture withConocoPhillips, Shell Transport & Trading Co. and Scottish and SouthernEnergy to begin work on a project to generate ""carbon-free"" electricity fromhydrogen.BP said the project, which would make use of a power station in northernScotland and export the carbon dioxide to a North Sea oil reservoir, wouldrequire total capital investment of some US$600 million (euro497million).Initial engineering feasibility studies have been completed, BP said, and thepartners are now working to confirm the economic viability of theproject.BP said it expects that review to be completed in the second half of 2006,allowing a final investment decision to be made next year. If approved, thegroup plans to start operation of the project in 2009.""This is an important and unique project configured at a scale that can offersignificant progress in the provision of cleaner energy and the reduction ofcarbon dioxide emissions,"" said BP Chief Executive Lord Browne.""For example, if applied to just 5 percent of the new electricity-generatingcapacity that the world is projected to require by 2050, such schemes would havethe potential to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by around 1 billion tonsa year _ a material step in the challenge the world faces,"" headded.In its March 2005 budget, the British government announced that it is examiningthe potential for new economic incentives to support the development of carboncapture and storage technologies and applications.The BP-led project would convert natural gas to hydrogen and carbon dioxidegases, then use the hydrogen gas as fuel for a 350 megawatt power station nearPeterhead, northern Scotland, and export the carbon dioxide to a North Sea oilreservoir for increased oil recovery and ultimate storage.When fully operational, the project would be expected to capture and storearound 1.3 million tons of carbon dioxide each year and provide 'carbon-free'electricity to the equivalent of a quarter of a million U.K. homes. BP said theproject would reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere bythe power generation by over 90 percent.
EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson predictedWednesday that safeguarding the country's water supply -- both fromterrorists and pollutants -- will be the environmental issue of thecoming decades.``I believe water, over the next decade and further, will be theenvironmental issue that we as a nation and, frankly, as a world willbe facing,'' he said. Keeping the nation's water safe and secure, headded, is ``an area of vulnerability for the United States and also anopportunity for us.''The first scientist to head the agency, Johnson said that inaddition to helping the Department of Homeland Security secure thewater supply, he wanted to find economically viable solutions for the10 percent of Americans whose drinking water is not healthy -- and forcities and municipalities facing huge bills to improve aging watertreatment facilities.In his first interview with reporters since being confirmed by theSenate last month, Johnson, a 54-year-old biologist and careerofficial at the Environmental Protection Agency, also talked aboutcontroversies that recently have plagued the agency.Asked about charges this week by an unnamed EPA scientist that theBush administration had watered down reports about global climatechange, Johnson talked about the need for good communications -- andsound science.``We have a number of people inside the agency and acrossadministrations that look at the documents to try to make sure that weare staying true to the science and at the same time communicatingeffectively,'' he said. ``And on any particular issue if the way it issaid isn't your particular leaning or viewpoint, then you say `You'vecompromised the science,' or `You haven't done a good job ofcommunicating.' ''Conceding the existence of climate change but not ready to predictsits severity or its causes, Johnson said, ``My focus is on advancingtechnologies and achieving real results.'' He touted a program hecalled Methane to Market, which captures methane gases for energy use.. ``The answer is going to be the technologies,'' he said. ``Whyaren't we focusing on making that a reality rather than the rhetoricof global climate change?''A native of Washington, D.C., Johnson said that after almost 25years at the agency, he is well familiar with political rhetoric fromthe business and environmental communities as well as from Congress,the public and the press. ``I've heard it all,'' he said. ``I don'twant to waste time focusing on the rhetoric. I want to get pastthat.''Johnson took Congress to task for failing to ratify internationalenvironmental treaties that the United States has signed on to --including the Persistent Organic Pollutant Treaty, which reduces oreliminates the production, use or release of 12 toxic chemicals. TheUnited States, a leader in pressing for the agreement, signed thetreaty on May 23, 2001. Congress has yet to ratify the pact.He made no mention of the U.S. refusal to sign on to the Kyotointernational agreement to restrict greenhouse gases, which tookeffect in 140 nations earlier this year. Both Congress and PresidentBush have opposed it, advocating voluntary steps instead.Noting that treaties can take years to negotiate and then ratify,Johnson said of the organic pollutant pact, ``Frankly, I don't want towait.''While he said he would prefer a legislative solution to aregulatory one, Johnson said he would forge ahead if Congress does notact -- as the EPA did in March in issuing a rule limiting mercuryemissions from new and existing coal-fired power plants.``We've got a Mercury problem internationally,'' Johnson said. Hesaid he hopes to share ``the very technologies that we're going to usein the United States for dealing with mercury control'' -- such astechniques called activated carbon injection or carbon sequestration-- with other countries that are contributing to the mercury problem,like China.He also advocated bridging shortfalls in the U.S. energy supplywith alternatives from nuclear to solar, and he foresaw the day whenenvironmental requirements could be ``the driver'' of economicprogress. ``We as a nation are facing significant shortfalls,'' hesaid. ``Either we at EPA can be a stumbling block or we can provideincentives.''
Some Texas geologists believe the best way to get rid of the carbondioxide produced by burning fossil fuels is to simply put it backwhere it came from.On Monday, scientists began burying 3,000 tons of compressed carbondioxide 1 mile beneath an old oil field near Dayton. If the planworks, most carbon dioxide -- a greenhouse gas -- could be capturedfrom area smokestacks and stored harmlessly underground, not pumpedinto the atmosphere.""We're going to test every aspect of this to determine whether it issafe,"" said lead researcher Susan Hovorka, with the University ofTexas at Austin's Bureau of Economic Geology.So-called carbon sequestration is not a new idea. Scientists haveexperimented with storing the gas on the ocean floor and thousands offeet below ground.Norway has already buried nearly 70 million tons below the North Seain the space where it had extracted fuels.Annually, man-made sources of carbon dioxide emit 7 to 10 billiontons of the gas.Capturing a major chunk of those emissions, and storing them deepbelow ground, could ease global warming problems, scientists say,while giving the world time to move away from fossil-fuel dependency.The effort by UT geologists, in conjunction with scientists fromother labs nationwide, is the first major attempt to determinewhether the sandstone layer beneath the Texas and Louisiana coastsmakes a good carbon dioxide reservoir.For the next two weeks, trucks from Baytown and Louisiana willdeliver compressed carbon dioxide to the site in Liberty County.Using a modified oil well, the researchers will pump the gas intosandstone deposits 5,050 feet below ground.There the gas -- so compressed it is almost a liquid -- soaks intothe sandstone and saltwater, like bubbles in Coca-Cola, Hovorka said.Among the team's concerns is that too much pressure may cause theshale layer atop the sandstone to crack, or might even cause a smallearthquake.But Hovorka said such problems can be solved by closely monitoringthe pressure where the gas enters the ground.As for leaks, the research team has calculated that just 1 percent ofthe gas will seep into the atmosphere after 300 years.The group has chemically ""tagged"" the gas they are burying so theycan measure if any returns to the surface in the coming weeks andmonths.Even at relatively high concentrations, carbon dioxide is notharmful. After all, anyone who drinks a carbonated beverage inhalesit.And now the gas is simply being dumped into the atmosphere, so alittle returning to the surface poses no danger, Hovorka said.Environmentalists said the plan is worth pursuing.""If it's something that can be done reliably and safely, then this isone way to mitigate against the impact of greenhouse gas emissions,""said Ramon Alvarez, an atmospheric scientist in the Texas office ofEnvironmental Defense.Should burying the carbon dioxide below ground prove safe andreliable, the next hurdle will be cost, scientists say.Removing carbon dioxide from fossil fuel fumes would be expensive, aswould building the infrastructure to transport the gas below ground.But Hovorka said the price tag would not be exorbitant.For pennies on the dollar more than current electric rates, she said,people could use fossil fuels with cleaner air and consciences.
President Bush, in one of the least-noticed gesturesof his European visit, has pledged to help developing nationssuch as China and India cut back on their fast-growingoutput of the greenhouse gases linked to global warming.Bush signed a pact with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Wednesdayto help poorer countries adopt more energy-efficient technologies in powergeneration, transportation and industry.Although the agreement lacked specific commitments for new spending, diplomats andanalysts say it could help take political pressure off theUnited States, the world's largest polluter, and remove a majorobstacle to achieving the goals set out in the KyotoProtocol, the agreement on climate change that went into effectFeb. 16 despite a U.S. boycott.The Bush-Schroeder agreement ""can be very meaningful as a start. Itcan get the United States and developing countries on board,""said ZhongXiang Zhang, an energy and climate policy analyst atthe East-West Center, a think tank in Honolulu.The Kyoto Protocol's weak point is that even as wealthy nationscut back on pollution, greenhouse gas emissions from China, Indiaand other developing nations keep rising at a sizzling rate.China's emissions of carbon dioxide, the most common greenhouse gas, arerising at more than twice the rate of the UnitedStates, while Germany's overall output is dropping. In fact, Chinais widely projected to overtake the United States as theworld's top source of greenhouse gases by 2025.""China is building a new 1,000-megawatt power plant every week withold, Eisenhower-era technology,"" said Douglas Ogden, director of the Chinaprogram at the Energy Foundation in San Francisco. ""They're goingto keep building the oldest, dirtiest plants unless we dosomething. The world can ill afford even one greenhouse gasproducer on the U.S. scale, let alone two.""China and other developing nations are exempted from the Kyoto Protocol'srules for emission cutbacks because their governments are afraid thelimits would hobble their rise from poverty.""The European side wants hard targets from the United States anddeveloping countries, which is ... very difficult,"" Zhang said. ""Butif they can work together to subsidize advanced technologies ...it would be very positive.""The key to the U.S.-German initiative is the most polluting ofmajor energy sources -- coal.Schroeder and British Prime Minister Tony Blair are pressing Bush tojoin them in creating an ambitious aid program to helpdeveloping nations adopt new technologies that reduce emissions from coalpower plants and save energy. Blair holds the annual rotatingpresidency of the G-8, the group of industrialized nations, andhe says he will make the proposal a top priorityfor the group's summit meeting in July.Although environmentalists advocate the expansion of wind and solar energy production,China and India are expected to continue to rely ontheir huge reserves of coal for most of their energyneeds in the near future. The two countries derive 80percent and 65 percent, respectively, of their electricity from coal,compared to the U.S. share of 51 percent.""Coal is really the workhorse for the economies of India andChina in the decades to come, so that's why coalis so important for global warming,"" said Bernd Kramer, ministercounselor for science, technology and environment at the German Embassyin Washington.In the next eight years, China expects to put into operation562 coal-fired plants -- nearly half the world's total --and India is projected to add 213 such plants, accordingto government figures. The United States is expected to buildonly 72.For years, the U.S. government has invested heavily in clean-energy research.For 2005, it budgeted nearly $3 billion for research anddevelopment of climate-change technology, mostly through subsidies and tax breaksfor work on hydrogen fuel-cell developments and so-called clean coaltechnology, which releases less carbon dioxide.Hydrogen fuel cells are widely believed to be 15 to 20years away from commercial viability, while clean-coal technology is alreadyon the market. The most prominent clean-coal method goes bythe cumbersome name of Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle, or IGCC.Under the process, coal is turned into a gas, whichis then burned in a process that allows carbon dioxideto be siphoned off rather than released into the atmosphere.Plants built with this technology release 15 percent less carbon dioxideand can be combined with a futuristic option called ""carbonsequestration,"" in which the carbon dioxide byproduct is injected intooil and gas aquifers underground, eliminating emissions altogether.What is needed now is not further research but aid toget these two methods to market, say Schroeder, Blair andmany experts.One prominent environmental group, the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington,has estimated that the extra cost of using IGCC andcarbon sequestration in all plants being built in developing nationswould be just $6 billion a year.""This amount would be a huge investment in global security, andit is very low compared to the $50 billion thatthe G-8 gave in development assistance last year,"" said DavidHawkins, the council's climate policy director.If China, India and other nations start snapping up this newtechnology, a big winner could be San Francisco's Bechtel Corp.,which has already built two coal-fired power plants and twonuclear plants in China, with several more under construction orprojected. Bechtel recently formed an alliance with General Electric Co.to develop IGCC power plants.Amos Avidan, a principal vice president of Bechtel, said China iseager to make its power plants cleaner and reduce thenation's severe air pollution.The IGCC technology ""hasn't yet taken off,"" Avidan said, ""but webelieve it can become a mainstream technology in a coupleof years or so and eliminate the cost gap. Wethink it has great potential for China.""Other industry analysts are more skeptical.""The problem with these leapfrog technologies is they have a well-proventrack record of mostly failing,"" said Dale Simbeck, vice presidentof technology for SFA Pacific Inc., a Mountain View energyindustry consulting firm.He noted that there are only two IGCC power plants operatingin the United States, despite two decades of federal subsidies.One failed attempt was the Pinon Pine power plant, anIGCC plant near Reno completed in 2000 at a pricetag of $335 million, split equally between a local powercompany and the U.S. Energy Department. The plant has beenplagued by technical snafus and has never been fully operational.Simbeck, who has worked as a consultant on China power issuesfor the World Bank and the Chinese government, said Chinahas enough technological know-how. Its main barrier, he said, isrigid government policies that shield state-owned power companies from competition.""The Chinese are just telling the West what it wants --'Help us build with IGCC, please help fund these withour companies' -- but it's not necessary,"" he said.Lee Schipper, director of transportation research for World Resources Institute inWashington, said China's reputation as a big polluter is unfair.The Beijing government is spending billions of dollars annually onpollution prevention, he noted.China's efficiency programs are getting a boost from European and BayArea experts. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory is working with theEnergy Foundation on a host of programs, ranging from consumerappliance standards to building codes. And the California Air ResourcesBoard has helped Chinese federal and state governments set upair-quality monitoring programs.""China is improving at many times the rate of improvement inthe United States,"" Schipper said. ""The Bush administration should begetting its own carbon house in order instead.""
Almost a decade ago, Tampa Electric opened an innovative power plantthat turned coal, the most abundant but the dirtiest fossilfuel, into a relatively clean gas, which it burns togenerate electricity. Not only did the plant emit significantly lesspollution than a conventional coal-fired power plant, but it wasalso 10 percent more efficient.Hazel R. O'Leary, the secretary of energy at the time, wentto the plant, situated between Tampa and Orlando, and praisedit for ushering in a ""new era for clean energyfrom coal."" Federal officials still refer to the plant's ""integratedgasification combined cycle"" process as a ""core technology"" for thefuture, especially because of its ability -- eventually -- toall but eliminate the greenhouse gases linked to global warming.Since that plant opened, however, not a single similar plant hasbeen built in the United States. Abundant supplies of naturalgas -- a bit cleaner and, until recently, a lotcheaper -- stood in the way.But even now, with gas prices following oil prices into thestratosphere and power companies turning back to coal, most newplants -- about nine out of 10 on the drawingboard -- will not use integrated gasification combined-cycle technology.The reason is fairly simple. A plant with the low-pollution, high-efficiencytechnology demonstrated at the Tampa Electric plant is about 20percent more expensive to build than a conventional plant thatburns pulverized coal. This complicates financing, especially in deregulated markets,while elsewhere utilities must persuade regulators to set aside theircustomary standard of requiring utilities to use their lowest-cost alternatives.(A federal grant of $143 million covered about a fourthof the construction cost of the Tampa Electric plant, whichwas originally a demonstration project.)The technology's main long-term advantage -- the ability to control greenhousegas emissions -- is not winning over many utilities becausethe country does not yet regulate those gases.That could be a problem for future national policy, critics say,because the plants being planned today will have a lifetimeof a half-century or more. ""It's a very frightening specterthat we are going to essentially lock down our carbonemissions for the next 50 years before we have anotherchance to think about it again,"" said Jason S. Grumet,the executive director of the National Commission on Energy Policy.The commission, an independent, bipartisan advisory body, has recommended that thefederal government spend an additional $4 billion over 10 yearsto speed the power industry's acceptance of the technology. Ina recent report, the commission concluded that ""the future ofcoal and the success of greenhouse gas mitigation policies maywell hinge to a large extent on whether this technologycan be successfully commercialized and deployed over the next 20years.""Grumet was more succinct. Integrated gasification combined cycle technology, combined withthe sequestration of carbon stripped out in the process, ""isas close to a silver bullet as you're ever goingto see,"" he said.Until Congress regulates carbon emissions -- a move that many inthe industry consider inevitable, but unlikely soon -- gasification technologywill catch on only as its costs gradually come down.Edward Lowe, general manager of gasification for GE Energy, adivision of General Electric that works with Bechtel to buildintegrated gasification combined-cycle plants, said that would happen as moreplants were built. The premium should disappear entirely after thefirst dozen or so are completed, he added.Even now, Lowe said, the technology offers operational cost savings thatoffset some of the higher construction costs. And if Congresseventually does limit carbon emissions, as many utility executives saythey expect it to do, the technology's operational advantages couldmake it a bargain.James E. Rogers, the chief executive of Cinergy, a heavily coal-dependentMidwestern utility, is one of the technology's biggest industry supporters.""I'm making a bet on gasification,"" he said, because heassumes a carbon-constrained world is inevitable. ""I don't see anyother way forward,"" he said.The operating savings of such plants start with more efficient combustion:They make use of at least 15 percent more ofthe energy released by burning coal than conventional plants do,so less fuel is needed. The plants also need about40 percent less water than conventional coal plants, a significantconsideration in arid Western states.But for some people, including Rogers and other utility leaders whoanticipate stricter pollution limits, the primary virtue of integrated gasificationcombined-cycle plants is their ability to chemically strip pollutants fromgasified coal more efficiently and cost-effectively, before it is burned,rather than trying to filter it out of exhaust.Proponents say that half of coal's pollutants -- including sulfur dioxideand nitrogen oxides, which contribute to acid rain and smog-- can be chemically stripped out before combustion. So canabout 95 percent of the mercury in coal, at abouta tenth the cost of trying to scrub it fromexhaust gases racing up a smokestack.The biggest long-term draw for gasification technology is its ability tocapture carbon before combustion. If greenhouse-gas limits are enacted, thatjob will be much harder and more expensive to dowith conventional coal-fired plants. Lowe, the GE executive, estimated thatcapturing carbon would add about 25 percent to the costof electricity from a combined-cycle plant burning gasified coal, butthat it would add 70 percent to the price ofpower from conventional plants.Gasification technology, although new to the power sector, has been widelyused in the chemical industry for decades, and the generalmanager of the gasification plant run by Tampa Electric, MarkHornick, said it was not difficult to train his employeesto run the plant. Tampa Electric is the principal subsidiaryof TECO Energy of Tampa.Disposing of the carbon dioxide gas stripped out in the process,however, is another matter. Government laboratories have experimented with dissolvingthe gas in saline aquifers or pumping it into geologicformations under the sea. The petroleum industry has long injectedcarbon dioxide into oil fields to help push more crudeto the surface.Refining and commercializing these techniques is a significant part of a$35 billion package of clean energy incentives that the NationalCommission on Energy Policy is recommending. The Senate considered someof those ideas in a big energy policy bill lastweek, but it is doubtful whether Congress will approve thefunds to enact them because they are tied to regulatingcarbon emissions for the first time, something that many industryleaders and sympathetic lawmakers oppose.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)Still, the energy bill may have some incentives for industry toadopt gasification technology, and the Department of Energy will continuerelated efforts. These include FutureGen, a $950 million project todemonstrate gasification's full potential -- not just for power plantsbut as a source of low-carbon liquid fuels for carsand trucks as well, and, further out, as a sourceof hydrogen fuel.Regardless of the politics of carbon caps, the Energy Department hasmade it clear that it intends to push the developmentof integrated gasification combined-cycle technology. Last month, for example, MarkMaddox, a deputy assistant secretary, said at an industry gatheringthat the technology ""is needed in the mix -- needednow.""Some industry leaders are skeptical, to say the least. ""We wouldnot want to put all of our eggs in onebasket as far as a single technology is concerned,"" saidWilliam Fang, deputy counsel for the Edison Electric Institute, atrade association whose members, shareholder-owned utilities, account for three-quarters ofthe country's generating capacity.Besides, he added, many of his members think that mandatory carboncontrols, in place in much of the world since theKyoto Protocol came into force in February, can be keptat bay in the United States -- possibly indefinitely.It's a risky strategy -- for industry and for the climate.""Coal-fired plants are big targets,"" said Judi Greenwald of thePew Center on Global Climate Change, ""and if we doget serious about climate change, they are going to beon the list of things to do quite early.""
The forecast, courtesy of the United Nations, isgrim.Today, more than a billion people lack access to safe drinkingwater. Polluted water contributes, each year, to the death ofabout 15 million children under age 5. By midcentury, between2 billion and 7 billion people will face water shortages.""No region will be spared from the impact of this crisis,""Koichiro Matsuura, director general of Unesco, recently warned. ""Water suppliesare falling while the demand is dramatically growing.""He estimated that in the next two decades the average amountof water available per person on the planet will shrinkby a third.But the United Nations is also working hard on solutions, helpingpoor countries learn a subtle art that lets them bettermanage their water resources to avoid tragedy.The method is known as isotope hydrology. Cheap and reliable, ittakes advantage of the fact that water molecules carry uniquefingerprints, based in part on differing proportions of the oxygenand hydrogen isotopes that constitute all water. Isotopes are formsof the same element that have variable numbers of neutronsin their nuclei.Using the tools of isotope hydrology, scientists can discover the age,origins, size, flow, and fate of a water source. Andthat information, in turn, can guide sound water-use policy, lettingwater engineers better map underground aquifers, conserve supplies and controlpollution.For instance, if the method reveals that the water in awell is young and recently derived from rain, villagers canpump away vigorously. But if it turns out to bevery old -- what scientists call fossil water -- theyneed to move gingerly, taking care not to exhaust thewater supply.""You take it out once, like oil,"" Werner Burkart, head ofthe nuclear science programs of the International Atomic Energy Agency,said in an interview.The U.N. group, best known for fighting the spread of nucleararms, is leading the hydrology effort. Based in Vienna, Austria,it works at developing techniques as well as sharing themwith scientists around the world.""We do a lot of capability building and training of localpeople, so it becomes sustainable -- so we don't haveto inject support all the time,"" said Ana Maria Cetto,the agency's head of technical cooperation. ""They're building their owncapacity to manage their own resources.""A little money goes a long way. Each year, the isotopehydrology program spends only about $2 million on research and$5 million to aid developing states. Still, that is enoughto finance 84 projects in more than 50 countries, includingBangladesh, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Morocco, and Senegal.""If you look at the Middle East, everywhere you are usingold water,"" said Pradeep Aggarwal, the head of the agency'sisotope hydrology unit. ""It was laid down 10,000, maybe 100,000years ago. So you have to understand there's a limitto how long this will go.""After more than 25 years of cooperative work, the agency hasgathered so much information that it is now fashioning adetailed portrait of the planet's water resources that could helpprevent future crises and reduce regional friction that may eruptin water wars.""We're talking about food security, sustainable development,"" Aggarwal said. ""If it'sbased on unsustainable water resources, you jeopardize everything.""(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)Oceans and seas constitute 97 percent of the planet's waters. Theremaining 3 percent is fresh water, most locked up asice, soil moisture, and deep groundwater. What is available topeople -- mainly as rivers, lakes, aquifers, reservoirs and wetlands-- comes down to less than 1 percent.Using that fresh water wisely requires considerable knowledge of the Earth'swater cycle, the outlines of which are well known, centeringon evaporation and rain, runoff and seepage. But local riddlesabound. The puzzles can include how often a particular bodyof water is renewed, where it flows, and whether differentbodies are physically linked through underground flows.In the past, water engineers would address such unknowns by carefullymeasuring rain and the levels of rivers and other bodiesof water for many decades -- typically a half-century ormore. It usually took that long to learn the subtletiesof the local cycles.However, isotope hydrology can do it in days, quickly illuminating water'spassage through the depths. ""You really need to know howthe water gets in and moves,"" said Aggarwal. ""Isotopics letyou do that in a cost-effective way.""The raw material is everywhere. Air, soil and water naturally containoxygen in two forms -- oxygen 16 and oxygen 18,which has two extra neutrons in its nucleus. Oxygen 18represents about 1 oxygen atom in every 500. Because itis heavier than oxygen 16, more is left behind whenwater evaporates. As a result, seawater is rich in oxygen18; rain and snow are relatively poor, and increasingly sothe further inland they fall.These gradients are echoed underground. The tools of isotope hydrology letscientists see the differences, creating a window into the depths.For instance, comparing samples from different wells can reveal ifthe groundwater mixes or becomes isolated in separate pools.In Ethiopia, the International Atomic Energy Agency used such techniques tohelp a foundering project. To supply water to the capital,Addis Ababa, the Ethiopians drilled 25 large wells, assuming thata not-too-distant river would renew the aquifer. But when thepumping started, water levels fell much faster than predicted.""They didn't understand the hydrology,"" Aggarwal recalled. ""They came to usfor help.""In a two-day survey, the agency discovered little connection between theriver and the wells, prompting an overhaul of the projectthat put new emphasis on judicious use. Scientists have nowmapped the speed and direction of the area's limited groundwaterflow.Ethiopia's reaction to the episode was to demand that its waterscientists put greater emphasis on isotope hydrology, making it ""astandard tool for the country,"" said Mohamed ElBaradei, the agency'sdirector-general.Over continents and wide lands, the study of isotope signatures canreveal if aquifers flow under national borders, helping neighbors collaborateon the intelligent use of scarce water.That is just what the atomic energy agency is doing inthe blistering heat of the Eastern Sahara desert, with Libya,Chad, Egypt and Sudan. They have joined together to mapthe shared water resources of the Nubian aquifer, a vastsubterranean body whose lobes range over nearly a million squaremiles, an area bigger than Iran and Iraq combined.""We're trying to elucidate the connections,"" said Mokdad Maksoudi, an experton African technical cooperation at the agency. ""Some parts ofthe aquifer are very old, with fossil water. Some arerecharged through the Nile.""We're trying to understand the recharge, so the countries can preciselygauge the best policies,"" he said.The stakes are high because areas of fossil water are vulnerableto quick depletion.A main goal of isotope hydrology is to discover the ageof groundwater, defined as the last time it had contactwith the atmosphere.This is calculated in many ways. Cool temperatures, for example, lowerthe concentrations of oxygen 18, and thus, unusually low amountsof the atom in groundwater imply that the body ofwater arose long ago, during ice ages and cooler climaticeras.A more exact way to determine age is to measure carbon14, a radioactive isotope that water bears in minute quantitiesand that, with clocklike precision, steadily decays into other substances,allowing researchers to calculate the elapsed time.Scientists have used such methods to address a humanitarian crisis inBangladesh that the World Health Organization calls the ""largest masspoisoning of a population in history.""Millions of people in Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries,drink arsenic-contaminated water, the poison gradually debilitating its victims beforespawning cancers that kill them.Good intentions lay behind this horror. For decades, the government andaid groups had urged people to give up pond water,often a carrier of lethal disease, and instead to digshallow wells. But no one tested the aquifers for arsenic.For years, the atomic energy agency and its isotope hydrologists, usingthe carbon 14 and oxygen 18 methods, have worked closelywith the Bangladeshis to help them map aquifer mazes andidentify safer water supplies.The news is mixed. The scientists have found that the arsenictends to reside in shallow aquifers, and that deeper levelsbear none of the deadly poison. In some cases, however,these deep aquifers have connections to the shallower ones, andpumping them out could draw in the contaminated water.""So you can have water at 100 meters that is arsenic-freetoday, but could become polluted in the future,"" Aggarwal said.He added that the teams have discovered even deeper waters thatare unconnected to the surface and will probably stay pure.But the isotope-dating methods show that these very deep aquifersare old and not undergoing renewal, calling for careful conservation.""If you pump it out in a major way,"" hesaid, ""it will hurt.""The flow of detailed hydrological information, he said, has been ""atremendous boost"" to the government's understanding and has helped itmake substantial changes in policy. ""Part of solving the problem,""Aggarwal said, ""is to understand its origin and extent.""Experts agree that hydrology will become even more important in thefuture, as growing water shortages intensify conflicts between states, whetheror not they result in water wars. Some analysts seeclean water as poised to supplant oil as the world'smost contested natural resource.Burkart of the atomic energy agency said that reliable information aboutthe hidden world of water could only help dissipate internationaltensions.""The more you know,"" he said, ""the better.""
SEARCH IS ON FOR A WAY TO TRAP PLANET-HEATING CARBON DIOXIDEMoving in Washington and financial categories for release Sunday, Aug.21. WASHINGTON -- With the world poised to generate hugevolumes of carbon dioxide in the next 25 years, expertssay the need to capture the planet-heating gas and storeit in safe places is becoming urgent -- and increasinglyfeasible.Using available technologies, carbon dioxide (CO2) can be captured and pumpedinto geologic formations deep underground, scientists say.The technique might add as little as 25 cents to thecost of a gallon of gasoline or $40 a monthto a typical residential electric bill, a Princeton University scientistestimates, and the cost would be expected to fall asinnovations are developed.A group at Arizona State University is investigating another approach, withestimated costs that are considerably higher but coming down. Itwould involve combining CO2 with plentiful minerals to form substancesthat would be chemically stable for millions of years.The cost of allowing the heat-trapping gas to remain in theatmosphere could be far higher.Nearly all atmospheric scientists believe that increases in CO2 and other""greenhouse gases"" have caused the Earth's surface temperature to rise.Many fear the concentration is approaching the point known as ""dangerousanthropogenic interference,"" when altered weather patterns, rising and acidified seas,and other unforeseen changes could bring about global havoc.Nevertheless, projected economic growth over the next few decades imply drasticincreases in the atmospheric concentrations of the dominant greenhouse gas,CO2, which is produced by the combustion of coal, petroleumand natural gas.The scale of the imminent increases is illustrated by a UnitedNations projection that the amount of electricity produced in theworld's coal-burning power plants will double between 2002 and 2030.Robert H. Socolow of Princeton University has calculated that the pollutionproduced by these plants during those 28 years will includeapproximately 501 billion tons of CO2.That's almost as much CO2 as scientists believe coal burning hasvented into the air since the turn of the 17thcentury, the time of William Shakespeare.""If we're going to build that many coal plants, we're goingto make one hell of an impact on the planet,""Socolow said. ""I think it's obvious that a substantial fractionof that carbon dioxide should not be allowed to enterthe atmosphere.""Socolow and ecologist Stephen Pacala, co-directors of the Princeton Carbon MitigationInitiative, say the world must move rapidly to develop acombination of strategies, from the use of carbon-free alternative energiesto the capture and storage of CO2, in order toreduce the buildup of greenhouse gases.Removing CO2 from power plant emissions is not as difficult asit might sound.About 15 percent of the flue gas from a traditional coal-firedpower plant is carbon dioxide, Socolow said.If droplets of chemicals known as amines are sprayed through theflue gas in a chamber known as an absorption tower,the CO2 will stick to the amines, he said.Then, under heat, the amine-CO2 combination breaks apart, freeing the aminechemical to be routed back into the absorption tower tocollect more CO2.The next step, Socolow said, is to compress the CO2 intowhat's called a ""supercritical"" fluid, almost as dense as water.Socolow said a 1,000-megawatt coal plant would produce about 50 millionbarrels of supercritical carbon dioxide per year.Several ways of storing the captured gas are being explored.In one strategy, being explored by physicist Andrew Chizmeshya and chemistMichael McKelvy at Arizona State University, the supercritical CO2 wouldbe combined with abundant surface rocks to form permanent carbonatecompounds.If a common rock called serpentine is ground and mixed withwater and supercritical CO2 in a solution Chizmeshya likens to""dirty soda pop,"" the CO2 combines with the serpentine toform magnesium carbonate, or magnesite, he said. The mineral isstable for millions of years.The procedure would add $200 to the cost of using aton of coal, but Chizmeshya said this is dramatically belowthe estimated cost when they started working on the systemfive years ago.He and McKelvy said they believe they have the solution toa problem that could lower the cost even more.The alternative approach of injecting the captured CO2 underground would notbe a totally new technology.In fact, the energy industry now injects compressed carbon dioxide intothe ground to pressurize oil or gas reserves and makeit easier to get the fuel out of the ground.Also, Norway uses a deep below-ground disposal system for carbon dioxideremoved from natural gas in a purification step.Socolow said new technologies like carbon dioxide storage, sometimes called carbonsequestration, will not work unless society decides to put aprice on simply venting the gas into the atmosphere.""Investment in technology is, I think, necessary, but there will beno actual the large-scale implementation of the technology until itis cheaper to put it underground than to pay thetax to emit it,"" he said.That would imply caps on emissions or a carbon tax, bothof which have been non-starters with the Bush administration.However, Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman recently announced that the government wouldspend $100 million on moving ""sequestration technology from the laboratoryto the field."" He said that would bring the country""a step closer to significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions whilemaintaining the important role coal plays in America's energy mix.""Socolow said experts have calculated that the cost of pumping thegas into deep caverns would be about $25 a ton,or about $60 for every ton of coal.By the time the cost is passed through the coal andpower industries to the consumer, the cost of a kilowatthour of electric power would probably go up 20 percent,or $40 on a $200 monthly home power bill, hesaid.But that's too much, said Paul N. Cicio, executive director ofthe Industrial Energy Consumers of America.""If my members' energy cost goes up 20 percent, they're outof business,"" he said.He says his industry supports Bush administration initiatives to develop newtechnologies and energy efficiencies, but costly CO2 capture and storageefforts will work only if competing economies such as Chinaand India do likewise.John Topping, founder of the Climate Institute, an environmental organization devotedsolely to climate change issues, agreed with Socolow and Pacalathat a combination of strategies is urgently needed.""We need to find ways to make renewable fuels and nuclearpower more competitive, and to get these coal plants tostart sequestering CO2, and to develop a clean hydrogen fuelsystem and do a lot of other things,"" he said.""It may be a little bit here and a little bitthere, but if something is not done soon, we're justgoing to be piddling into the wind,"" he added.On the Web:CO2 storage animation: www.statoil.com/statoilcom/svg00990.nsf/web/sleipneren?opendocumentJeff Nesmith's e-mail address is jeffn@coxnews.com
",One way to get rid of carbon dioxide from coal-burning power plants is to bury it. Carbon sequestration is not new; petroleum producers have pumped compressed CO2 into oil-bearing structures to force oil to the surface for years. Norway has buried 70 million tons below the North Sea. Carbon dioxide from a coalgas plant in Wyoming is pumped 185 miles to a working oilfield in Canada. In 2004 scientists planned to sequester carbon in deep sandstone deposits. Coal gasification is necessary for sequestration. Improving the two technologies was part of a $35 billion package the Senate considered in 2005. ,"Carbon sequestration has been tested in the United States, Canada and Britain using old or working oil or gas fields as storage areas. Since 1996 Norway has buried nearly 70 million tons of compressed carbon below the North Sea where it had extracted fuels. In each case the CO2, after being captured by solvents, would be pumped into geologic formations which were thought to be safe storage areas. As efficient technology to compress, transport and store the carbon is developed it could be provided to developing countries such as China and India offering help in the fight against global warming. ","Carbon sequestration, the process of capturing carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels and storing it under the ground or ocean floor, is not a new idea and is gaining support. In Texas, scientists are burying tons of compressed carbon dioxide beneath an old oil field. Norway has buried tons below North Sea oilfields. The energy industry now injects compressed CO2 into the ground to make it easier to get oil out of the ground. Environmentalists say the plan is worth pursuing if safe, reliable, and dependent on cost. The question arises if the process could cause an earthquake. ","Norway has stored waste CO2 below a North Sea oilfield since 1996. Texas geologists are pumping compressed CO2 into a sandstone layer one mile beneath an old Louisiana-Texas oil field. CO2 from a coalgas plant in Wyoming is being pumped under a working Weyburn, Saskatchewan oilfield. Britain will pump CO2 from a Scottish power station to an old North Sea oil reservoir. The US backs carbon sequestration development and coal gasification technology that can sequester siphoned-off CO2, and plans to use carbon sequestration for mercury control. Arizona is investigating combining CO2 with plentiful minerals to form chemically stable substances. "
D0930,D0930-B,"Experts from around the world gathered in Paris Tuesday for a UNESCO conference on oceans, coasts and islands where the focus will be on stemming the erosion of biodiversity and the depletion of fish stocks, the UN's science and education body said.""The experts will examine progress made in achieving the objectives set by the international community ... to improve conservation and management of the marine environment that makes up 72 percent of the surface of our planet,"" according to a press release.Seventy-eight countries are represented in the week-long conference, including 21 small island developing states (SIDS), which are heavily dependent on the sea for economic development.UNESCO said the conference would also tackle questions of governance and climate change.""High seas governance is particularly important as 64 percent of the worlds oceans lie beyond the limits of national jurisdictions and are subject to considerable stress, notably due to fishing,"" UNESCO said.""The debate on oceans and climate will focus on the problems of acidification, carbon dioxide sequestration and Arctic change.""Climate change is expected to emerge as a major cause for the loss of biodiversity by the end of the century and to increase the vulnerability of coastal communities through erosion and flooding,"" it said.
New industrial technologies and novel financial ideas can help the fight against global warming by cutting greenhouse gas emissions, according to scientists and climate experts gathered here by the World Bank.Among new technologies, ""carbon capture and sequestration"" made more converts, and trading in carbon emissions rights on financial markets got an encouraging boost at the meeting.Some scientists proposed a new concept of bringing together all the different methods of cutting greenhouse gases so that important progress made in each individual sector can contribute to worldwide climate stabilization.""Do we have to wait for new technologies or do we have the technlogies today to address climate change?"" World Bank Chief Scientist and Senior Advisor Robert Watson asked on opening the energy conference here Monday.The United States, which has refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol on global greenhouse gas emissions, put much stock in new technologies to cut heat-trapping pollution.But the Kyoto signataries are skeptical that technology alone can do the trick as they go ahead with their commitment to slash total greenhouse gas emissions by 2012 to five percent below the level they were in 1990.""Countries that have decided to go down the road of technologies must have the responsability to tell the world if it is working or not,"" Netherlands Minister for Development Cooperation Agnes Van Ardenne told the meeting.Carbon capture and sequestration was showcased as a promising technology by Robert Socolow, a Princeton University energy and environment expert. Tests run in Norway and Algeria were promising, he said, and BP was about to announce a major carbon capture project in California.The technique consists of capturing carbon gas emissions from power companies and injecting them in porous sediments beneath the ocean bottom where they can remain ""sequestered"" for thousands of years.It is part of Socolow's theory of ""stabilization wedges,"" which takes its name from the triangular-shaped metal used to break wood into smaller pieces. It defines sectors where the biggest efforts should be made to make a difference in the fight against global warming.Published in Science Magazine in August 2004, Socolow's theory aims at solving global climate problems in 50 years by using existing technologies.The wedges are the development of renewable sources of energy in 15 sectors including, new propulsion systems for vehicles, carbon sequestration, nuclear energy, biomass and the environment.According to Socolow, if significant progress is made in seven of the 15 sectors, worldwide carbon dioxide levels in 2055 can be the same as in 2005.In the financial world, the development of markets for trading in pollution rights is increasingly being used as an environmental policy tool for pollution control.Currently installed in Chicago, Illinois, London and soon in Canada, the pollution rights market allows firms and investors to trade the right to emit specific pollutants the same as stocks. The tonne of carbon at present is valued at around 100 dollars.European governments, which have signed the Kyoto Protocol, are more active on the pollution rights markets than the United States.But several US companies such as Ford, International Paper, IBM, American Electric Power, as well as cities and state governments such as New Mexico have also begun trading on the new markets.
Existing technology should be used to capture and store carbon dioxideunderground to prevent emissions and curb global warming, experts suggested in acomprehensive report released by the United Nations.The document, prepared by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change andreleased Monday, recommends using existing and emerging technologies forcapturing the carbon dioxide produced by power plants and factories before itenters the atmosphere.Carbon dioxide is one of the gases believed to cause the so-called greenhouseeffect, which is warming the earth's atmosphere and is widely believed to be thecause of the planet's increasingly bizarre weather patterns.""While the most important solutions to climate change will remain energyefficiency and cleaner energy sources, this new report demonstrates thatcapturing and storing carbon dioxide can supplement these other efforts,"" saidKlaus Topfer, executive director of United Nations EnvironmentProgram.The report suggests emissions should be captured from sources such aselectricity generation, refineries and oil plants, compressed and stored ingeological formations, the oceans or in minerals, instead of being released inthe atmosphere.Such practices could lower the cost of mitigating climate change by one-thirdover the next century and potentially account for half of emissions reductionsneeded between now and 2100 to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in theatmosphere.Storage of carbon dioxide underground could use much of the technology alreadydeveloped by the oil and gas industry and become increasingly economical withtechnological advances, the report said.The report estimates the risks associated with underground storage are similarto current practices of storing natural gas and that 99 percent of properlystored carbon dioxide would not leak during the next 1,000 years.The 650-page report is considered the most comprehensive on the subject and waswritten by some 100 experts from 32 countries.According to the IPCC, emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasescould raise global average temperatures by up to 1.4 to 5.8 degrees Celsius bythe end of the century.They will continue to affect weather patterns, water resources, ecosystems andextreme climate events. Scientists already have detected many early signs ofglobal warming, including the shrinking of glaciers and Arctic sea ice, longersummers, changes in the migratory patterns of birds and the spread of manyinsects and plants toward the poles.The IPCC report comes ahead of the first meeting in November of all signatoriesof the Kyoto Protocol since the treaty took effect this year. The Protocol, aninternational treaty on climate change, caps the amount of carbon dioxide thatpower plants and fuel-intensive manufacturers in more than two dozen countriesare allowed to emit.The United States, which accounts for one-fourth of the world's greenhousegases, has refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, saying it would harm the U.S.economy by raising energy prices and eliminating some 5 millionjobs._____On the Net:
EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs on Wednesday called on oil companies todo more to boost refining capacity.Piebalgs said he would meet with executives from major oil companies and askthem to do more to remove production bottlenecks.""I consider it very important that oil companies behave in the most responsiblemanner given this situation,"" he told the European Parliament in Strasbourg,adding that the European Commission will strengthen dialogue with oil-producingcountries, including OPEC.Europe pays higher prices for oil because it has less refining capacity than theUnited States. Several U.S. refineries in the U.S. Gulf have yet to restart workafter suffering storm damage from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.Piebalgs reiterated Europe should switch to using alternative energy sources andboost research of wind, wave and solar, and hydrogen energy and of clean coaland carbon sequestration.""The energy potential of biomass in the EU needs to be developed. A BiomassAction Plan will be tabled before the end of the year,"" he said.MEPs warned against the EU's over-dependence on oil and said Europeans shoulddiversify their energy sources.""We face structural problems which go far beyond any short-term crisis, saidFiona Jane Hall, a Liberal Democrat.In a resolution scheduled to be voted on Thursday, lawmakers were to call on EUgovernments to initiate a world summit of large consumer and producercountries.The resolution also calls on the European Commission to ensure the EU becomesthe world's least fossil-fuel-dependent and most energy-efficient economy by2020.Current EU president Britain aims to win an agreement on a new Europe-wide lawdesigned to reduce energy consumption before the end of thisyear.Addressing the assembly, Britain's Europe Minister Douglas Alexander saidreaching an agreement on the law had grown in importance as oil prices are atrecord levels.The new regulation would require EU governments to save at least one percentmore energy a year by promoting savings in the supply and distribution ofelectricity, gas, heating and fuels to households, transport and otherindustrial consumers.""Promoting energy efficiency is quite rightly at the top of the agenda,""Alexander told the Parliament.The legislation must be approved by the European Parliaments and EU governmentsbefore it can become law.EU energy ministers are due to hold their next meeting in Luxembourg on Oct. 6.The European Parliament will hold its next plenary session in midOctober.""We hope that the institutions will secure what is an important directive,""Alexander said.
BP PLC said Monday it will increase its investment in alternative energyprojects through a new business unit, BP Alternative Energy.BP, which is based in Britain, said it expects to invest up to $8 billion(euro6.8 billion) in solar, wind, hydrogen and carbon-abatement technology overten years.The investment represents only fraction of BP's annual $14 billion (euro12billion) to $16 billion (euro13.6 billion) in capital expenditures but is aneightfold increase from the $1 billion (euro850 million) spent over the pastdecade, Chief Executive John Browne told a press conference.The company plans to double its solar capacity from the roughly 100 megawatts ofcapacity it currently has in the United States, Spain, India andAustralia.Browne said BP was also planning a carbon-sequestration project for 2006 and2007, in which carbon emissions from power plants would be re-injected in fallowoffshore gas and oil fields.Browne said BP looked to hire ""several hundred"" staff, including engineers, tosupport its new alternative and renewable energy investment plan, which is amongthe biggest by an oil major.Browne said he expects the unit to achieve a 15 percent return oncapital.Friends of the Earth, an environmental organization, welcomed BP's ""modest""shift of emphasis to focus more on alternative energy sources.American Depositary Receipts of BP fell $1.72, or 2.5 percent, to close at$66.11 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Oil companies Statoil ASA and Royal Dutch Shell PLC announced a joint projectWednesday to cut pollution by using carbon dioxide from power plants to enhanceoil recovery.The companies said they want to capture carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping,greenhouse gas, from natural gas electricity production and inject it intooffshore fields so more oil can be recovered.""The project consists of a gas-fired power plant and methanol productionfacility at Tjeldbergodden in mid-Norway, providing CO2 to the Draugen andHeidrun offshore oil and gas fields,"" the companies said in astatement.At a news conference, Statoil Chief Executive Helge Lund said the project was inan early phase, and it was not clear when the companies would decide whether togo ahead.""There are many pieces that must fall into place before a decision to invest,""he said.Norway is the world's third-largest oil exporter, after Saudi Arabia and Russia,and also exports vast amounts of natural gas from its offshorefields.However, the Nordic country has traditionally produced most of its ownelectricity from clean hydroelectric plants, and using natural gas generation athome has met stiff opposition because it would increase pollution.Statoil and Shell now want to develop a system for using natural gas to producepower in Norway, scrub and capture the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and use itto maintain pressure in offshore oil reservoirs, boosting cruderecovery.The companies said the project would be the world's largest effort to use carbondioxide to enhance oil recovery, with up to 2.5 million tons (2.8 million U.S.tons) of the gas injected into the fields per year.That is roughly the emissions from 1 million automobiles, or about 5 percent ofNorway's total CO2 emissions.""This is an important milestone for Shell towards our vision for greener fossilfuels with part of the carbon dioxide captured and sequestrated underground,""said Shell's Chief Executive Officer Jeroen van der Veer.The project also calls for laying electricity cables from the land-based powerplant to the platform, further cutting pollution by reducing the need to burnpetroleum offshore to produce the electricity the installationsneed.Lund, of Statoil, said the project aims to meet several of the challenges facingworld society, including cutting pollution while increasing electricity and oilsupplies.The project won immediate praise from environmental groups, which had adamantlyopposed construction of natural gas power plants in Norway.""This is the best news I have had in a long time. We have worked for this foryears,"" said Frederic Hauge, leader of the Norwegian environmental groupBellona.Thomas Palm, a carbon dioxide expert with the Norwegian environmental groupZero, said the project could increase oil recovery by at least 155 millionbarrels in its lifetime.___On the Net:
The European Commission called on EU nations Tuesday to back a Danish pilotproject meant to boost the use of cleaner energy sources.It said the start of a new pilot energy plant at the Elsam power station nearEsjberg, Denmark, expected on Wednesday, offered a way ahead in the search fornear-zero carbon dioxide emissions, in efforts to stem globalwarming.EU spokeswoman Antonia Mochan said the project received euro8.5 million (US$10million) in EU research funding to get it off the ground. The project foreseesthe first use of new technology to capture carbon emitted from the conventionalpower plant and store it underground.The technology can be used on coal and oil power plants and can also be used inoil refineries.The plant at Elsam will be the first to test the new technology, the EU said.""By developing technologies for carbon capture and storage, we can reduceemissions in the medium term as we move to large scale use of renewable,carbon-free energy sources,"" said EU Research Commissioner Janez Potocnik in astatement.The EU said it hoped to use the project to ensure the 25-nation bloc meets itsinternational commitments to reduce carbon emissions.The EU and China signed an agreement last month to encourage the development ofcleaner coal-fired power plants, also with the new technology to capture carbondioxide emitted from coal burning plants.China is heavily dependent on coal, which accounts for 70 percent of its energyconsumption. In the EU, fossil fuels account for around 85 percent.
Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney's office reopened discussions Wednesday with eight otherstates that are trying to forge a landmark emission reductionplan for power plants, but it was unclear if anycompromise might be reached.Seven of those states decided last week to move forward withoutMassachusetts because of Romney's reluctance to act on the greenhousegas pact, or to detail his concerns with it.Rhode Island has also wavered on signing the pact.But Wednesday, after Romney held a press conference to announce anemission plan for the state's dirtiest power plants, he indicatedthat Massachusetts could join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative pactif it incorporated a key piece of the state plan.An e-mail message scheduled to go out to the otherstates by Wednesday night.Romney has raised concerns over the potential cost to businesses ofthe multistate program. Last week, Romney suggested a price cap,but not give details.""Anytime you negotiate you have to make sure you let peopleknow that if you don't get things that are satisfactory,you won't sign on,"" Romney said. ""And so we willhave a negotiation.""The new state plan, which was announced Wednesday, would be thefirst in the country to require power plants to limitemissions of carbon dioxide.The plan, which takes effect next month, places a cap plants'payments exceeding carbon dioxide levels the state sets for eachplant. The limits target the state's six oldest and mostpower plants.The Massachusetts plan places a limit on how much pollution eachplant could emit. Because those limits are lower than whatthe plants currently emit, the owners would have to reducecarbon dioxide or fund other carbon dioxide reductions elsewhere. Forexample, companies could plant trees that absorb carbon dioxide, tooffset excess emissions.Those investments would have to take place in the Northeast. Ifthe cost to a Massachusetts plant reaches $6.50 to offseta ton of carbon dioxide emissions for 12 consecutive months,the plant could shop for reductions worldwide.Environmentalists are critical of the plan, saying it will allow powerplants to pollute at a set price rather than lowercarbon dioxide emissions.New York state officials, who first proposed the regional pact, saidthey have not yet reviewed details of Romney's state plan.But they indicated that if Romney's proposal is anything likewhat he announced in the press conference Wednesday, it wouldnot reduce carbon dioxide emissions enough and would be rejected.""Massachusetts has decided to pursue a ... plan that will imposenew taxes, but fail to ... reduce emissions,"" said PeterConstantakes, an aide to Governor George S. Pataki, a Republican.Beth Daley cam be reached at bdaleyglobe.com
Subsidiaries of BP and Edison International said Friday that they wereplanning to build a power plant that would run onoil residues, and that 90 percent of the carbon dioxidewould be captured and pumped into an oilfield, where itwould help push more oil to the surface.The $1 billion plant would be adjacent to a BP refineryin Carson, Calif., about 20 miles south of Los Angeles,and would be the first of its kind in thecountry, the companies said. BP is already drawing up engineeringplans for a plant in Scotland that would sequester itscarbon dioxide in an underground oil-bearing formation; that plant isto run on natural gas.The companies said they hoped to make a final decision onthe plant in 2008 and have it running in 2011.It would qualify for a tax credit as a carbon-freeenergy source under the 2005 energy bill, company executives said.The plant would run by mixing an oil residue, petroleum coke,in a chamber with steam and a controlled amount ofoxygen. In this technique, called gasification, both the fuel andthe water give up hydrogen atoms to form hydrogen gas.This process also produces carbon monoxide, which is converted tocarbon dioxide, giving off heat to sustain the reaction.The hydrogen is then burned in a turbine engine, the kindthat electric companies normally run on natural gas, and thedominant combustion product is water. The carbon dioxide is compressedinto a liquid and injected into an oilfield.Although the fuel is an oil residue, and not coal, thetechnology is the same as one mentioned by President Bushin his State of the Union speech on Jan. 31,in which he said, ""we will invest more in zero-emissioncoal-fired plants.""When coal or other fuels are gasified, conventional pollutants like sulfurand carbon dioxide, which is believed to be responsible forclimate change, can be removed before combustion, while the volumeof gas is still relatively small.Petroleum coke from the Carson refinery is usually trucked to theharbor and shipped to China, where it is burned forfuel.As a nearly carbon-free source of electricity, the plant would competewith wind power. Its construction cost is about double thecost of a wind turbine, according to Theodore F. CraverJr., the chairman and chief executive of Edison Mission Energy,an unregulated subsidiary of Edison International. But the production ofwind turbines cannot be scheduled, and they generally produce onlyabout 30 percent as much electricity as they would byrunning around the clock; this plant will run 90 to95 percent of the hours in a year, he said.And the Los Angeles Basin, where it is located, isoften short of power, he said.Steve Westwell, chief executive of BP Alternative Energy, said that allof the technologies had already been demonstrated individually, including separatingcarbon dioxide from hydrogen, and pumping the carbon dioxide underpressure into the ground. One area in which the projectwould stretch existing technologies is in the turbine; hydrogen burnshotter than natural gas, and tends to make turbine bladesbrittle.BP is seeking to put the carbon dioxide in oilfields ownedby Occidental Petroleum.Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who attended the project announcement, said, ""This willbe the first plant of its kind in the wholecountry, and I think it is a perfect fit forour state.""
The US Energy Department (DOE) announced Tuesday that an experimental project in Canada to injectcarbon dioxide into oil fields for its permanent storage in geologic formations proved to be successful.The test removed 5 million tons of the Earth's leading greenhouse gas, while raising the daily crude output of the Weyburn oil field in Saskatchewan, Canada, by 10,000 barrels, saida DOE statement.If the methodology could be applied worldwide, one-third to one-half of the carbon dioxide emissions to be released into the atmosphere could be eliminated over the next century, and billionsof barrels of additional oil could be recovered, the department said.Greenhouse gases can trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to global warming if their emissions continue without being limited.The Weyburn Project is a joint effort by the US Energy Department, the Canadian government and private industry. Carbon dioxide comes from the Great Plains Synfuels plant in Beulah, N.D.,where it is a byproduct from coal gasification.""The success of the Weyburn Project could have incredible implications on reducing CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions and increasing America's oil production,"" said Energy Secretary SamuelBodman in a statement released by his office. Bodman is visiting the Middle East.In the Weyburn Project, the carbon dioxide when pumped into theoil reservoir increased the pressure and brought more oil to the surface. The technology can raise oil recovery by up to 60 percent,and extend the life of oil fields by decades as well.The technology can also provide a permanent repository for the carbon dioxide in geologic formations, the DOE added.The next phase of the Weyburn Project is expected to focus on improving injection efficiency and the process of refining.
",The U.S. Energy Department announced that an experimental carbon sequestration project had been successful. CO2 from a coal burning plant in North Dakota was pumped to an oilfield in Canada. The test removed five million tons of CO2. Subsidiaries of BP and Edison International planned to build a $1 billion power plant in California that would capture 90% of the carbon dioxide produced and pump it into an oilfield. Oil companies Statoil ASA and Royal Dutch Shell PLC announced plans for similar plants. A pilot energy plant in Denmark using similar technology was scheduled to start in March 2006. ,In Sept. 2005 a United Nations report said that application of carbon sequestration to power plants would become economical and that 99 percent of the carbon would not leak during the next 1000 years. In November the U.S. Department of Energy revealed than an experimental project with sequestration in a live oil field brought more oil to the surface. In 2006 plans were announced for similar projects in Britain and Norway with a Norwegian expert saying their project could increase oil recovery by at least 155 million barrels in its lifetime. ,"A UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests carbon dioxide emissions should be captured from generating plants and refineries then compressed and stored in geological formations, oceans or in minerals. Underground storage could use technology already developed by the oil and gas industry. The US Department of Energy estimates that one-third to one-half of the emissions released into the atmosphere could be eliminated by this methodology. BP and Edison International subsidiaries plan to build a plant in Carson, California, where 90% of the carbon dioxide would be captured and pumped into an oilfield. A similar Danish project is underway. ","The UN and EU recommend carbon sequestration. The EU signed an agreement with China that encourages it. Carbon sequestration tests in Algeria were promising. A joint US-Canadian project injects CO2 from coal gasification in ND into the Weyburn oil field in Saskatchewan. BP plans a power plant in Scotland that will sequester CO2, and with Edison International, one adjacent to a BP refinery in Carson, CA. Statoil ASA and Royal Dutch Shell plan a power plant in Tjeldbergodden, Norway, that will provide CO2 to Draugen and Heidrun offshore oil and gas fields. Massachusetts suggests companies plant trees that absorb CO2. "
D0931,D0931-A,"Abdul Qadeer Khan, the father of the Pakistani atomic bomb, deliveredweapons grade highly enriched uranium to Iran in 2001, and Iran aimsat getting a nuclear bomb next year, an Iranian opposition group saidin Vienna Wednesday.
Investigators looking into illicit transfers of nuclear weaponstechnology have recently uncovered a South African-based scheme todeliver a complete uranium enrichment plant to Libya, The Los AngelesTimes reported Sunday.Citing documents and interviews, the newspaper said the discoveryprovided fresh evidence of the reach and sophistication of Pakistaniscientist Abdul Qadeer Khan's global black market in nuclear know-howand equipment.The dimensions of the plot began to emerge in September, when policeraided a factory outside Johannesburg, according to the report.They found the elements of a two-story steel processing system forthe enrichment plant, packed in 11 freight containers for shipment toLibya.South African officials have disclosed only that they discoverednuclear components, the paper said.But The Times has learned that the massive system was designed tooperate an array of 1,000 centrifuges for enriching uranium.Once assembled in Libya, the plant could have produced enoughweapons-grade uranium to manufacture several nuclear bombs a year,according to the report.Delivery of the plant would have greatly accelerated Libya's effortsto develop nuclear weapons, The Times said.The discovery of a South African connection to A.Q. Khan network hasled to the arrests of four business and engineering figures in SouthAfrica, including some who had been involved in the former apartheidregime's nuclear program, the paper said.Khan, the disgraced architect of Pakistan's nuclear program, tookfull responsibility in February for nuclear leaks to Iran, Libya andNorth Korea.Libya has since renounced its nuclear program and allowed the UnitedStates to ship its key technological components out of the country.South Africa, which was close to testing a nuclear device in the late1970s, has abandoned its nuclear program following the collapse ofthe apartheid regime.
Pakistan on Monday denied reports in a US magazine that it was helping American special forces target suspected weapons sites for air strikes in neighbouring Iran.""There is no such collaboration,"" foreign ministry spokesman Masood Khan said, referring to an article in the New Yorker magazine that claimed Pakistani scientists were providing the US with information on Iranian nuclear sites.""We do not have much information about Iran's nuclear programme so I think this report is far-fetched and it exaggerates facts which do not exist in the first place,"" Khan told a weekly press briefing in Islamabad.""I do not think there is any substance in what has been reported. I think this is pure conjecture.""The New Yorker said Pakistan was helping the US in return for guarantees that it will not have to hand over disgraced nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan to international authorities for questioning.Khan, the architect of Pakistan's nuclear programme, in February took responsibility for transfers of nuclear technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea. He was pardoned by President Pervez Musharraf.The magazine said Pakistani scientists were giving information to be used by US commandos searching for underground nuclear installations in eastern Iran.
The government expressed skepticism Thursday over a claim by anIranian opposition group that Abdul Qadeer Khan, the disgraced fatherof Pakistan's nuclear program, had given Iran a blueprint for anuclear bomb and some weapons-grade uranium.""We do not attach importance to this report or claim,"" ForeignMinistry spokesman Masood Khan told a news conference in the capital,Islamabad. ""The validity of this claim is being questioned and it isbeing viewed with skepticism.""Pakistan's official reaction came a day after Farid Soleimani, aformer senior official for the National Council for Resistance inIran, told reporters in Vienna that Tehran received the bomb diagrambetween 1994 and 1996 and a quantity of highly enriched uranium fromKhan in 2001.While the Pakistani spokesman dismissed the claim, he said itsinvestigations into the unauthorized spread of nuclear technologywere yet not closed. Masood Khan said Pakistan had not received areport through formal channels on the claim, and it was open to ""anycommunication.""Pakistan has said it is cooperating with the International AtomicEnergy Agency in its investigations into the international nuclearblack market, although it has not let the agency question Khan.Khan has been under virtual house arrest in Islamabad since a scandalbroke in December over his alleged black market dealings thatsupplied nuclear weapons technology to Iran, North Korea and Libya.President Gen. Pervez Musharraf pardoned Khan _ long revered inPakistan for helping build a nuclear deterrent against rival India _after he made a public confession in February. All but one of Khan'scolleagues have been released after questioning.
Pakistan has defended its efforts to halt leaks of nuclear technologyamid suggestions that Iran's nuclear weapons program received morehelp from a renegade Pakistani scientist than previously disclosed.The CIA _ which provides the U.S. Congress with six-monthly updateson reported efforts by Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea and Syria toobtain chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weaponstechnology _ posted an unclassified version on its Web site thisweek.Analyzing the report, The New York Times said it indicates thatbomb-making designs provided by Abdul Qadeer Khan to Iran in the1990s were more significant than Washington has said.Pakistan Foreign Office spokesman Masood Khan criticized the Timesreport, saying it was ""based on flimsy evidence, hearsay and snippetsof conversations.""The CIA report does not mention any 'designs for weapons orbomb-making components.' Weapons and bomb-making are the writer's owncreative insertions,"" the spokesman said Saturday.""In the past year, Pakistan has conducted an inquiry to unearth anillicit network of international black-marketeers, dismantled it andshared the results of the inquiry transparently with the people ofPakistan.""Pakistan has been cooperating with the IAEA and the internationalcommunity to thwart international black-marketeers from proliferatingsensitive nuclear technology,"" Masood Khan said.The International Atomic Energy Agency _ the United Nations' nuclearwatchdog _ has been investigating Iran's nuclear activities for about18 months, but the agency remains unable to determine if nearly twodecades of Iranian nuclear activities were purely peaceful or if thegovernment had a secret weapons agenda.Tehran says its activities were for generating electricity, while theUnited States says they were for making weapons.Iran and European negotiators have reached a tentative compromisecommitting Tehran to freeze all uranium enrichment activities,diplomats say, but the Iranian government still must approve thedeal.A.Q. Khan, considered a national hero for leading the development ofPakistan's nuclear deterrent, admitted in February to passing nucleartechnology to other countries. He was pardoned by President Gen.Pervez Musharraf, who cited his service to the nation, but remainsunder virtual house arrest in Islamabad.""Iran's nuclear program received significant assistance in the pastfrom the proliferation network headed by Pakistani scientist A.Q.Khan,"" the CIA report said. ""The A.Q. Khan network provided Iran withdesigns for Pakistan's older centrifuges as well as designs for moreadvanced and efficient models and components.""It said Libya disclosed receiving similar assistance from Khan, headof Pakistan's nuclear program from the 1970s until 2001.""Even in cases where states took action to stem such transfers,knowledgeable individuals or non-state purveyors of WMD- andmissile-related materials and technology could act outside governmentconstraints,"" the report said.The Times focused on the phrase ""designs for more advanced andefficient models, and components,"" indicating that ""components""refers to weapons components.The Times said American officials have publicly referred only to therole of A.Q. Khan's network in supplying Iran with designs for olderPakistani centrifuges used to enrich uranium, but that they alsosuspect it provided a warhead design.Citing a tape it obtained of a closed-door speech to a private group,the paper quoted former CIA Director George J. Tenet describing A.Q.Khan as ""at least as dangerous as Osama bin Laden"" because of hisrole in providing nuclear technology to other countries.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf on Sundaydefended his decision not to allow international investigators tointerrogate A.Q. Khan, the rogue Pakistani scientist accused ofpeddling nuclear secrets around the world.Appearing offended, Musharraf said the requests from U.N. nuclearinspectors indicated a lack of trust in Pakistan. In a CNN interview,he portrayed the issue as a matter of national pride.President Bush met with Musharraf on Saturday and urged thePakistani general to make sure that all possible information aboutnuclear proliferation by the Khan network be turned over to theAmericans. Musharraf promised to do so.But the White House did not ask for direct access to Khan --apparently in deference to Pakistani sensitivities about a man who, asthe father of the Pakistani atomic bomb, had been considered a hero.However, the International Atomic Energy Agency still wants tointerview Khan, who has been pardoned by Musharraf, as well as hisassistant, who is being held in Malaysia.Lacking such cooperation, officials deem it unlikely that Khan'sactivities will ever be fully unraveled, the Los Angeles Timesreported Sunday.In the CNN interview Sunday, Musharraf insisted that Pakistan coulddo the best job interrogating Khan.``It shows a lack of trust in us,'' Musharraf complained. ``We canquestion him the best, and then there is ... a domestic sensitivity.This man is a hero for the Pakistanis and there is a sensitivity thatmaybe the world wants to intervene in our nuclear program, whichnobody wants. ...''It is a pride of the nation,`` he concluded.Analysts have raised doubts about whether Musharraf is keeping Khanfrom speaking to international investigators for fear the scientistmight reveal the extent to which some of his activities may have beencondoned by the Pakistani military.Musharraf denied ''200 percent`` that any Pakistani government orthe military had any knowledge that Khan was making nuclear weaponsinformation available to other nations.During a visit to the United States, the Pakistani leader, a keyBush administration ally in the war on terrorism, also said that inhindsight, the U.S. decision to invade Iraq was a mistake.''We have landed ourselves in more trouble,`` he told CNN's ''LateEdition.``Musharraf said he had no idea where Osama bin Laden was hiding butsuggested that al-Qaida's command structure in Pakistan has beenbroken by recent military operations aimed at rousting terroristforces from tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan.In Pakistan, pro-government and opposition parties staged largestreet demonstrations to coincide with Musharraf's foreign tour.In the central city of Multan, the main opposition Islamic allianceheld a rally and vowed to force Musharraf to quit as army chief if hereneged on his promise to do so voluntarily by year's end, the Reutersnews agency reported.Loosening the military's control over politics has been a key goalof the Pakistani democracy movement, but the parliament recentlypassed a law that would allow Musharraf to continue to hold the toparmy job and the presidency.
A new report from the CIA says the arms trafficking network led bythe Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan provided Iran's nuclear programwith ""significant assistance,"" including the designs for ""advancedand efficient"" weapons components.The unclassified version of the report, posted Tuesday on theagency's Web site (www.cia.gov), does not say explicitly whetherKhan's network sold Iran complete plans for building a warhead, asthe network is known to have done for Libya and perhaps North Korea.But it suggests that U.S. intelligence agencies now believe that thebomb-making designs provided by the network to Iran in the 1990s weremore significant than the U.S. government had previously disclosed.In a recent closed-door speech to a private group, George J. Tenet,the former director of central intelligence, described Khan, thefather of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, as being ""at least asdangerous as Osama bin Laden"" because of his role in providingnuclear technology to other countries. A tape recording of the speechwas obtained by The New York Times.The report, issued to Congress, is an annual update, required by law,on countries' acquisition of illicit weapons technology. The postingof the unclassified version on the agency's Web site on Tuesday comestwo days before a meeting in Vienna, Austria, of the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear monitoring group,is scheduled to review the status of Iran's weapons program.""The Report to Congress on the Acquisition of Technology Relating toWeapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional Munitions"" isthe first to be issued by the agency since last November. Its focusis the six-month period from July to December 2003, but it alsodiscusses broader trends.The report says the agency remains convinced that Iran is pursuing aclandestine weapons program, despite claims to the contrary by theTehran government. It says Iran's stated willingness to allowinspections by the IAEA is likely to prevent Tehran from using itsdeclared nuclear sites to produce weapons, but warns that it may usecovert facilities for those purposes.The CIA began to infiltrate Khan's network in the late 1990s,according to the account Tenet is now spelling out in his speeches.That operation led to the unraveling of the network's ties to Libyaand the unmasking last year of Libya's illicit weapons program.
When experts from the United States and the International AtomicEnergy Agency came upon blueprints for a 10-kiloton atomic bomb inthe files of the Libyan weapons program earlier this year, they foundthemselves caught between gravity and pettiness.The discovery gave the experts a new appreciation of the audacity ofthe rogue nuclear network led by A.Q. Khan, a chief architect ofPakistan's bomb. Intelligence officials had watched Khan for yearsand suspected that he was trafficking in machinery for enrichinguranium to make fuel for warheads. But the detailed designrepresented a new level of danger, particularly since the Libyanssaid he had thrown it in as a deal-sweetener when he sold them $100million in nuclear gear.""This was the first time we had ever seen a loose copy of a bombdesign that clearly worked,"" said one American expert, ""and thequestion was: Who else had it? The Iranians? The Syrians? Al-Qaida?""But that threat was quickly overshadowed by smaller questions.The experts from the United States and the IAEA, the U.N. nuclearwatchdog -- in a reverberation of their differences over Iraq'sunconventional weapons -- began quarreling over control of theblueprints. The friction was palpable at Libya's Ministry ofScientific Research, said one participant, when the Americans accusedinternational inspectors of having examined the design before theyarrived. After hours of tense negotiation, agreement was reached tokeep it in a vault at the Energy Department in Washington, but underIAEA seal.It was a sign of things to come.Nearly a year after Khan's arrest, secrets of his nuclear blackmarket continue to uncoil, revealing a vast global enterprise. Butthe inquiry has been hampered by discord between the Bushadministration and the nuclear watchdog, and by Washington's concernthat if it pushes too hard for access to Khan, a national hero inPakistan, it could destabilize an ally. As a result, much of theurgency has been sapped from the investigation, helping keep hiddenthe full dimensions of the activities of Khan and his associates.There is no shortage of tantalizing leads. U.S. intelligenceofficials and the IAEA, working separately, are still untanglingKhan's travels in the years before his arrest. Investigators said hevisited 18 countries, including Syria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, onwhat they believed were business trips, either to buy materials likeuranium ore or sell atomic goods.In Dubai, they have scoured one of the network's front companies,finding traces of radioactive material as well as phone recordsshowing contact with Saudi Arabia. Having tracked the networkoperations to Malaysia, Europe and the Middle East, investigatorsrecently uncovered an outpost in South Africa, where they seized 11crates of equipment for enriching uranium.The breadth of the operation was particularly surprising to some U.S.intelligence officials because they had had Khan under surveillancefor nearly three decades, since he began assembling components forPakistan's bomb, but apparently missed crucial transactions withcountries like Iran and North Korea.In fact, officials were so confident they had accurately taken hismeasure, that twice -- once in the late 1970s and again in the 1980s-- the CIA persuaded Dutch intelligence agents not to arrest Khanbecause they wanted to follow his trail, according to a seniorEuropean diplomat and a former congressional official who had accessto intelligence information. The CIA declined to comment.""We knew a lot,"" said a nuclear intelligence official, ""but we didn'trealize the size of his universe.""President Bush boasts that the Khan network has been dismantled. Butthere is evidence that parts of it live on, as do investigations inWashington and Vienna, Austria, where the IAEA is based.Cooperation between the U.N. atomic agency and the United States hastrickled to a near halt, particularly as the Bush administrationtries to unseat the IAEA director general, Mohamed ElBaradei, who didnot support the White House's prewar intelligence assessments onIraq.The chill from the White House has blown through Vienna. ""I can'tremember the last time we saw anything of a classified nature fromWashington,"" one of the agency's senior officials said. Experts seeit as a missed opportunity because the two sides have complementarystrengths -- the United States with spy satellites and covertcapabilities to intercept or disable nuclear equipment, and the IAEAwith inspectors who have access to some of the world's most secretiveatomic facilities that the United States cannot legally enter.In the 11 months since Khan's partial confession, Pakistan has deniedU.S. investigators access to him. They have passed questions throughthe Pakistanis, but report that there is virtually no new informationon critical questions like who else obtained the bomb design. Norhave U.S. investigators been given access to Khan's chief operatingofficer, Buhari Sayed Abu Tahir, who is in a Malaysian jail.This disjunction has helped to keep many questions about the networkunanswered, including whether the Pakistani military was involved inthe black market and what other countries, or nonstate groups, beyondLibya, Iran and North Korea, received what one Bush administrationofficial called Khan's ""nuclear starter kit"" -- everything fromcentrifuge designs to raw uranium fuel to the blueprints for thebomb.Privately, investigators say that with so many mysteries unsolved,they have little confidence that the illicit atomic marketplace hasactually been shut down. ""It may be more like al-Qaida,"" said oneIAEA official, ""where you cut off the leadership but new elementsemerge.""(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)A POTENTIAL DANGERA.Q. Khan may have been unknown to most Americans when he wasrevealed about a year ago as the mastermind of the largest illicitnuclear proliferation network in history. But for three decades Khan,a metallurgist, has been well known to British and U.S. intelligenceofficials. Even so, the United States and its allies passed upopportunities to stop him -- and apparently failed to detect that hehad begun selling nuclear technology to Iran in the late 1980s. Itwas the opening transaction for an enterprise that eventually spreadto North Korea, Libya and beyond.Khan studied in Pakistan and Europe. After he secured a job in theNetherlands in the early 1970s at a plant making centrifuges -- thedevices that purify uranium -- Dutch intelligence officials beganwatching him. By late 1975, they grew so wary, after he was observedat a nuclear trade show in Switzerland asking suspicious questions,that they moved him to a different area of the company to keep himaway from uranium enrichment work.""There was an awareness,"" said Frank Slijper of the Dutch Campaignagainst Arms Trade, who recently wrote a report on Khan's early days,""that he was a potential danger.""Khan suddenly left the country that December, called home by hisgovernment for its atomic project. Years later, investigatorsdiscovered that he had taken blueprints for the centrifuges with him.In Pakistan, Khan was working to develop a bomb to counter India's,and Washington was intent on stopping the project.It later proved to be the first of several occasions when the UnitedStates failed to fully understand what Khan was up to.Joseph Nye, a Harvard professor who has served in severaladministrations, said U.S. intelligence agencies thought Pakistanwould try to make its bomb by producing plutonium -- an alternativebomb fuel. Nye was sent to France to halt the shipment of technologythat would have enabled Pakistan to complete a reprocessing plant forthe plutonium fuel. ""We returned to Washington to celebrate ourvictory, only to discover that Khan had already stolen the technologyfor another path to the bomb,"" Nye recalled.To gather more atomic gear and skill, Khan returned to theNetherlands repeatedly. But the United States wanted to watch him,and a European diplomat with wide knowledge of nuclear intelligencecited the two occasions when the CIA persuaded the Dutch authoritiesnot to arrest him. Intelligence officials apparently felt Khan wasmore valuable as an unwitting guide to the nuclear underworld.""The Dutch wanted to arrest him,"" the diplomat said. ""But they weretold by the American CIA, 'Leave him so we can follow his trail.""'A CHINESE CONNECTIONKhan quickly led the agents to Beijing. It was there in the early1980s that Khan pulled off a coup: obtaining the blueprints for aweapon that China had detonated in its fourth nuclear test, in 1966.The design was notable because it was compact and the first one Chinahad developed that could easily fit atop a missile.U.S. intelligence agencies only learned the full details of thetransactions earlier this year when the Libyans handed over two largeplastic bags with the names of an Islamabad tailor on one side and adry-cleaner on other -- one of several clues that it had come fromthe Khan Laboratories. The design inside included drawings of morethan 100 parts, all fitting in a sphere about 34 inches in diameter,just the right size for a rocket.Equally remarkable were the handwritten notations in the margins.""They made reference to Chinese ministers, presumably involved in thedeal,"" one official who reviewed it disclosed. And there was also areference to ""Munir,"" apparently Munir Khan, Khan's rival who ran thePakistan Atomic Energy Commission and was in a contest with Khan toput together a Pakistani weapon that would match India's.In that race, size was critical, because only a small weapon could beput atop Pakistani missiles. One note in the margin of the design,the official said, was that ""Munir's bomb would be bigger.""Intelligence experts believe that Khan traded his centrifugetechnology to the Chinese for their bomb design.A certain familiarity developed between Khan and those watching him.""I remember I was once in Beijing on a nonproliferation mission,""said Robert J. Einhorn, a longtime proliferation official in theState Department, ""and we knew that Khan was in Beijing, too, andwhere he was. I had this fantasy of going over to his hotel, callingup to his room, and inviting him down for a cup of coffee.""Of course, he never did. But if he had, Khan might not have beensurprised.Simon Henderson, a London-based author who has written about Khan formore than two decades, said the Pakistani scientist long suspected hewas under close surveillance. ""Khan once told me, indignantly, 'TheBritish try to recruit members of my team as spies,""' Hendersonrecalled. ""As far as I'm aware, he was penetrated for a long, longtime.""Still, for all the surveillance, U.S. officials always seemed a stepor two behind. In the 1990s, noted Einhorn, the assumption was thatIran was getting most of its help from Russia, which was providingthe country with reactors and laser-isotope technology. Virtually noattention was paid to its contacts with Khan.""It was a classic case of being focused in the wrong place,"" Einhornsaid. ""And if Iran gets the bomb in the next few years, it won't bebecause of the Russians. It will be because of the help they got fromA.Q. Khan.""TRIUMPH AND MYSTERYAs soon as Bush came to office, his director of central intelligence,George J. Tenet, began tutoring him on the dangers of Khan anddisclosing how deeply the agency believed it had penetrated his lifeand network. ""We were inside his residence, inside his facilities,inside his rooms,"" Tenet said in a recent speech. ""We were everywherethese people were.""But acting on the Khan problem meant navigating the sensitivities ofa fragile ally important in the effort against terrorism. That hasimpeded the inquiry ever since.Washington had little leverage to force Pakistan's president, Gen.Pervez Musharraf, to clamp down on a national hero, especially sinceKhan may have had evidence implicating the Pakistani government insome of the transactions. And in interviews, officials said theyfeared that moving on Khan too early would hurt their chances to rollup the network.Stephen J. Hadley, the deputy national security adviser, went toPakistan soon after the Sept. 11 attacks and raised concerns aboutKhan, some of whose scientists were said to have met with Osama binLaden, al-Qaida's leader. But Hadley did not ask Musharraf to takeaction, according to a senior administration official. He returned toWashington complaining that it was unclear whether the KhanLaboratories were operating with the complicity of the Pakistanimilitary, or were controlled by freelancers, motivated by visions ofprofit or of spreading the bomb to Islamic nations. The Pakistanisinsisted they had no evidence of any proliferation at all, a claimU.S. officials said they found laughable.As evidence grew in 2003, Bush sent Tenet to New York to meet withMusharraf. ""We were afraid Khan's operation was entering a new, moredangerous phase,"" said one top official. Still there was littleaction.But in late October 2003, the United States and its allies seized theBBC China, a freighter bearing centrifuge parts made in Malaysia,along with other products of Khan's network, all bound for Libya.Confronted with the evidence, Libya finally agreed to surrender allof its nuclear program. Within weeks, tons of equipment was beingdismantled and flown to the Energy Department's nuclear weapons labat Oak Ridge, Tenn.Pressures mounted on Musharraf. ""I said to him, 'We know so muchabout this that we're going to go public with it,""' Secretary ofState Colin L. Powell told journalists last week. ""'And you need todeal with this before you have to deal with it publicly.""'On television, Khan was forced to confess but he gave no specifics,and Musharraf pardoned the scientist. U.S. officials pressed tointerview him and his chief lieutenant, Tahir, a Sri Lankanbusinessman living in Dubai and Malaysia, who was eventually arrestedby Malaysian authorities.But the Pakistanis balked, insisting that they would pass questionsto Khan and report back. Little information has been conveyed.""Some questions simply were never answered,"" said one seniorintelligence official. ""In other cases, you don't know if you weregetting Khan's answer, or the answer the government wanted you tohear.""Khan's silence has extended to the question of what countries, otherthan Libya, received the bomb design. Intelligence experts say theyhave no evidence any other nation received the design, although theysuspect Iran and perhaps North Korea. But that search has beenhampered by lack of hard intelligence.""We strongly believe Iran did,"" said one U.S. official. ""But we needthe proof.""Khan has also never discussed his ties with North Korea, a criticalissue because the United States has alleged -- but cannot prove --that North Korea has two nuclear arms programs, one using Khantechnology.""It is an unbelievable story, how this administration has givenPakistan a pass on the single worst case of proliferation in the pasthalf-century,"" said Jack Pritchard, who worked for President Clintonand served as the State Department's special envoy to North Koreauntil he quit last year, partly in protest over Bush's Korea policy.""We've given them a pass because of Musharraf's agreement to fightterrorism, and now there is some suggestion that the hunt for Osamais waning. And what have we learned from Khan? Nothing.""SOME MISSING PIECESIn March, U.S. investigators invited reporters to the giant nuclearcomplex in Oak Ridge to display the equipment disgorged by theLibyans. They surrounded the site with guards bearing automaticweapons, and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham joined the officials inshowing off some of the 4,000 centrifuges.""We've had a huge success,"" he said.But it turned out that thecentrifuges were missing their rotors -- the high-speed internaldevice that makes them work. To this day, it is not clear where thoseparts were coming from. While some officials believe the Libyans weregoing to make their own, others fear the equipment had been shippedfrom an unknown location -- and that the network, while headless, isstill alive.John R. Bolton, the undersecretary of state for arms control andinternational security, echoed those suspicions, saying the networkstill had a number of undisclosed customers. ""There's more out therethan we can discuss publicly,"" Bolton said in April.Federal and private experts said the list of suspected customersincludes Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Malaysia, Indonesia,Algeria, Kuwait, Myanmar and Abu Dhabi.Given the urgency of the Libyan and Khan disclosures, many privateand governmental experts expected that the Bush administration andthe IAEA would work together. But European diplomats said theadministration never turned over valuable information to back up itswider suspicions about other countries. ""It doesn't like to share,"" asenior European diplomat involved in nuclear intelligence said of theUnited States. ""That makes life more difficult. So we're on thelearning curve.""Federal officials said they were reluctant to give the IAEAclassified information because the agency is too prone to leaks. Theagency has 137 member states, and U.S. officials believe some of themmay be using the agency to hunt for nuclear secrets. One senioradministration official put it this way: ""The cops and the crooks allserve on the agency's board together.""The result is that two separate, disjointed searches are on for othernuclear rogue states -- one by Washington, the other by the IAEA. Andthere is scant communication between the feuding bureaucracies.That lack of communication with the U.N. agency extends to theNuclear Suppliers Group, a loose organization of countries thatproduce nuclear equipment. It can stop the export of restrictedatomic technology to a suspect customer, but it does not report itsactions to the IAEA. Moreover, there is no communication between theIAEA and the Bush administration's Proliferation Security Initiative,which seeks to intercept illicit nuclear trade at sea or in the air.""It's a legitimate question whether we need a very different kind ofsuper-agency that can deal with the new world of A.Q. Khans,"" said asenior administration official. ""Because we sure don't have thesystem we need now.""THE HUNT GOES ONElBaradei, the head of the U.N. agency, says he is plunging ahead,pursuing his own investigation even as the Bush administrationattempts to have him replaced when his term expires late next year.In an interview in Vienna, he defended his record, citing theinformation he has wrung out of Iran, and his agency's discovery oftendrils of Khan's network in more than 30 countries around theglobe.""We're getting an idea of how it works,"" he said of the Khan network.""And we're still looking"" for other suppliers and customers.One method is to investigate the countries Khan visited before hisarrest. Nuclear experts disclosed that the countries wereAfghanistan, Egypt, Iran, Ivory Coast, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Mali,Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, North Korea, Saudi Arabia,Senegal, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates. Many ofthem are Islamic, and several of the African countries are rich inuranium ore.In one of its biggest operations, the agency is hunting for nuclearclues in a half-dozen of the network's buildings and warehouses inDubai, which for years were used as the central location forassembling and repacking centrifuges.Both in Washington and in Vienna, the most delicate investigationsinvolve important American allies -- including Egypt and SaudiArabia. So far, said European intelligence officials familiar withthe agency's inner workings, no hard evidence of clandestine nucleararms programs has surfaced.Suspicious signs have emerged, however. For instance, expertsdisclosed that SMB Computers, Tahir's front company in Dubai for theKhan network, made telephone calls to Saudi Arabia. But the companyalso engaged in legitimate computer sales, giving it plausible cover.Experts also disclosed that Saudi scientists traveled to Pakistan forsome of Khan's scientific conferences. But the meetings were notsecret, or illegal.There is also worry in both Washington and Vienna about Egypt, whichhas two research reactors near Cairo and a long history of internaldebate about whether to pursue nuclear arms. But Europeanintelligence officials said IAEA inspectors who recently went therefound no signs of clandestine nuclear arms and some evidence ofshoddy workmanship that bespeaks low atomic expectations.As forSyria, the Bush administration had repeatedly charged that it hassecretly tried to acquire nuclear arms. But the IAEA has so far foundno signs of a relationship with Khan or a clandestine nuclear weaponsprogram. Worried about what is still unknown, the IAEA is quietlysetting up what it calls the Covert Nuclear Trade Analysis Unit,agency officials disclosed. It has about a half-dozen specialists whoare scanning international files and records and databases forevidence of secret nuclear deals by the Khan network or itsimitators.""I would not be surprised to discover that some countries pocketedsome centrifuges,"" ElBaradei said. ""They may have considered it achance of a lifetime to get some equipment and thought, 'Well, maybeit will be good for a rainy day.""'
Public enemy No. 1 for most Americans is Osamabin Laden, the mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, attackswho continues to threaten more deadly strikes against the UnitedStates.In close competition for that dubious title should be Abdul QadeerKhan, 68, also known as A.Q. Khan, the Pakistani nuclearscientist who oversaw the spread of nuclear weapons to U.S.adversaries, possibly including al-Qaida, bin Laden's terrorist group.Khan arguably has done more to undermine U.S. security than binLaden. He has confessed to transferring nuclear weapons know-how toIran, Libya and North Korea. U.S. officials and investigators atthe U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency are still searching forother possible customers who possess Khan's digitized blueprints for nuclear-specificmanufacturing equipment and how-to manuals for running uranium enrichment centrifuges,much of it on handy compact disks.Since the invention of nuclear weapons 60 years ago, no onehas done more to spread those weapons to more countriesthan Khan. The Khan network of suppliers, middlemen and frontcompanies flourished across 30 countries. He was a for-profit nuclearproliferator, with a one-stop atomic emporium that allowed shoppers tobuy bomb designs, centrifuges for enriching uranium from uranium hexafluoride,and consulting services to help get weapons plants up andrunning.-- ""At least as dangerous as Osama bin Laden"" -- formerCIA Director George Tenet.-- ""A very serious proliferatorvery dangerous to the world"" -- Secretaryof State Colin Powell.-- Khan's nuclear smuggling network is ""mind-boggling"" and ""beyond anyone's imagination""-- Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, chief of the International Atomic EnergyAgency.-- ""A monstrous creature"" -- Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., top Democraton the House Foreign Relations Committee.-- Khan ""has poured kerosene on the nuclear proliferation embers."" --Henry Sokolski, executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Centerin Washington, D.C.-- ""He did huge damage"" to U.S. security -- Graham Allison,former assistant secretary of defense and author of ""Nuclear Terrorism:The Ultimate Preventable Catastrophe.""-- Khan is ""an evil genius, a Dr. Strangelove"" -- RobertOakley, former U.S. ambassador to Pakistan.Despite his notoriety, A. Q. Khan has escaped the ""most-wanted"" labelapplied to bin Laden because of a delicate diplomatic andpolitical minuet linking Khan, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf and PresidentBush. Each man for his own reasons has thrown acloak of silence over what is emerging as the biggestnuclear scandal in history.In contrast to the missing bin Laden -- target of aglobal manhunt -- Khan's whereabouts are well known. He isliving under house arrest in a tony section of Islamabad,the capital of Pakistan, as part of a deal thatMusharraf unveiled last year.That deal gave Khan a full pardon and allowed him tokeep the millions of dollars he is believed to havenetted from the illicit sales. In exchange, Khan took responsibilityfor the crimes and agreed to the house arrest --a punishment that forced Khan, a high profile and belovedfigure in Pakistan, to vanish from public life and scientificendeavor.A U.S. alert to Musharraf apparently triggered Khan's confession.According to Secretary of State Colin Powell, the United States byearly 2004 had amassed so much evidence that Khan waspeddling nuclear secrets that Powell telephoned Musharraf and told himto ""deal with"" Khan.""I said to him, ""We know so much about this thatwe're going to go public with it, and within afew weeks, okay? And you need to deal with thisbefore you have to deal with it publicly.""'The next step came on Feb. 4 when, in a dramatictelevised speech, Khan confessed and -- without naming the countriesthat had received his services -- accepted ""full responsibility"" forexporting nuclear technology. ""My dear brothers and sisters, I havechosen to appear before you to offer my deepest regretsand unqualified apologies,"" he said, speaking in English. The nuclearproliferation, he said, was ""initiated at my behest.""""I was confronted with the evidence and the findings, and Ihave voluntarily admitted that much of it is true andaccurate,"" he said.He was quick to absolve the Musharraf government of any involvement.While some of his colleagues at the A.Q. Khan ResearchLaboratories -- Pakistan's top nuclear facility -- are also underinvestigation for trafficking, ""There was never any kind of authorizationfor these activities by the government,"" he said.The next day, it was Musharraf's turn to appear before theTV cameras.Dressed in an Army jacket, khaki trousers and combat boots, thePakistani leader announced at a news conference that he hadpardoned Khan for spreading the potential for nuclear terror. ThePakistani president signed off by telling how much he admiredthe scientist.""All the proliferation, unfortunately, was under the supervision or orders ofDr. A.Q. Khan,"" Musharraf told a news conference, quickly addingthat Khan is ""still my hero"" for developing atomic weaponsfor Pakistan.""Dr. A.Q. Khan has made Pakistan a nuclear power,"" said Musharraf.""I want to protect his honor.""Musharraf insisted that the Pakistani government had no knowledge of Khan'sextensive proliferation network because the scientist had amassed enormous autonomyduring the previous two decades as he developed nuclear weaponsfor Pakistan.The general accused the governments of Libya and Iran of rattingon Khan to the IAEA. ""Muslim brothers did not askus before giving our names,"" Musharraf complained.Khan has been under house arrest since.Musharraf's eagerness to whisk the matter out of sight reflects aharsh political fact of life for the 61-year-old general. Khanis a hero in Pakistan and throughout the Islamic worldfor perfecting his country's first nuclear weapon -- and, bydefinition, the much-anticipated first ""Muslim bomb."" Pakistan exploded a seriesof atomic bombs in 1998, bringing that country into nuclearparity with archrival India, with whom it has fought threewars.Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador to Sri Lanka and adviserto prime ministers Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto, says Khanis so popular in Pakistan that if he announced hewanted his countrymen to give him money, ""150 million Pakistaniswould give it to him. Pakistani kids would empty theirpockets for him."" Haqqani teaches international relations at Boston Universityand is author of the forthcoming book, ""Pakistan between Mosqueand Military.""Musharraf presides over a nation festering with Islamic militants, with largesegments of the population sympathetic to al-Qaida and remnants ofthe fundamentalist Taliban regime in Afghanistan, which the U.S. militarytoppled three years ago. The general is in no positionto get tough with Khan by, for example, putting himon trial, especially since such a step would appear tobe catering to the United States, which is widely unpopularthroughout the country. Pakistan's religious parties already are angry withMusharraf for placing Khan along with at least a half-dozenof his associates under house arrest.Musharraf won't let U.S. investigators or officials from the U.N.'s InternationalAtomic Energy Agency question Khan directly (""It's a matter ofnational pride"" he says) to find out more about hisfar-flung proliferation network. From the Pakistani dictator's point of view,the least said about Khan, the better.The Pakistani leader, who has narrowly escaped two assassination attempts, keepsone eye nervously focused at all times on how Islamicmilitants in his nation react to his policies, especially whenthey involve coordination with the United States. And there isa huge amount of coordination. Powell said he speaks withMusharraf more than with any other foreign leader. ""We talkall the time,"" Powell said of the estimated 90 conversationshe said they have had.The Bush administration is also tiptoeing around the Khan case.Because Musharraf is a key ally in the U.S. war againstterrorism -- after the Sept. 11 strikes he agreed towithdraw support for the Taliban, a regime that had supportedal-Qaida -- the Bush administration doesn't want to add toMusharraf's precarious domestic circumstances by pushing too hard to gainaccess to Khan.Another reason the Bush administration is eager to let the Khancase gently disappear is that it represents a failure ofAmerican intelligence and diplomacy that one man -- the leadingnuclear scientist of a U.S. ally -- could do somuch damage for so long and escape detection.The U.S. silent treatment for Khan also spares the administration fromembarrassing comparisons with another intelligence failure -- the flawed predictionthat Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, the administration's statedreason for invading that country.In the one case, U.S. intelligence flunked with its ""slam dunk""certainty that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. In theother case, U.S. intelligence failed to detect the massive nuclearproliferation program based in Pakistan, an American ally. Khan didmuch, much more to foster the spread of nuclear weaponsthan Saddam Hussein ever did.In their eagerness to downplay the Khan case, American officials havetried to make it sound like ancient history. For example,during last fall's election campaign, President Bush declared that Khan'snuclear network ""has been brought to justice."" Similarly, Defense SecretaryDonald Rumsfeld asserted that Khan's operations have been ""rolled upThenetwork is gone.""Condoleezza Rice, Bush's former national security adviser and secretary of state-designate,called Khan's house arrest a sufficient penalty that matched thecrime. ""A.Q. Khan, in a sense, has been brought tojustice because he is out of the business that heloved most,"" she said.But the IAEA is not as cheery.""While we believe we have identified the major players and suppliers,we have not yet satisfied ourselves that we have gotall of the subcontractors. Nor have we accounted for allthe material that was produced for the network. Begging thequestion, where is it?"" said Mark Gwozdecky, the IAEA spokeman.The State Department's Bureau of Non-Proliferation, the lead U.S. agency forpreventing the global spread of weapons of mass destruction, hasdeclined to discuss the Khan case.""They just feel it's too sensitive and that there is nothingnew they feel they can say,"" said Jim Kelman, aState Department spokesman.Born in Bhopal, India in 1936, A. Q. Kahn and hisfamily migrated to Pakistan in 1952 five years after thecountry was formed in a bloody partition with India. Khancame from modest means -- his father was a teacherbut stressed the value of education as a way torise above the crippling poverty that pervades much of Pakistan.Like many Pakistanis of his generation, Khan's worldview was shaped byPakistan's opening conflict with India during the partition. In a2001 interview, Khan said that when he was a youthin the late 1940s, during the height of the partitionconflict, he recalled train after train ""full of dead Muslims""pulling into a local train station.When Khan's family -- and thousands of other Muslims -- leftIndia for Pakistan, Indian soldiers stripped them of their valuables,a loss of dignity that left a lasting impression onthe youngster.""I had been traveling with a pen that my brother gaveme when I passed my exams, and just as Iwas crossing out of India, a border guard reached towardsme and snatched it from my pocket,"" Khan said. ""Thepen had almost no monetary value, but the guard's behaviorhurt me, and it was something I'll never forget.""Khan trainedas an engineer at the University of Karachi, where heobtained his bachelors of science degree in 1960, and thenobtained advanced metallurgical training in the then-West Germany, Belgium andHolland.In the 1970s, Khan worked in Europe for Urenco, a consortiumfunded by the British, Dutch and German governments that manufacturedhigh-speed centrifuges that produce enriched uranium U-235 by spinning uraniumhexafluoride gas. It's the U-235 that comprises uranium-fueled atomic bombs.Khan later stole centrifuge designs and fled to Pakistan in 1976where he ran the country's nuclear program for the next25 years. In 1983 a Dutch court convicted him inabsentia for stealing nuclear secrets and sentenced him to fouryears in prison, but the conviction was later overturned ona technicality. Those secrets greatly advanced Pakistan's nuclear program thatculminated in the 1998 atomic test explosions.Khan received his nation's highest civilian honors for his contributions.The scientist is something of a Renaissance man. Married to aSouth African, he has westernized tastes, is fluent in Englishand Dutch, an animal lover who takes in stray dogs,raises peacocks and enjoys feeding wild monkeys. He has aspecial fondness for Urdhu poetry and beautiful houses (he hasowned properties in Pakistan, Mali and Dubai) and expensive cars.A father of two, he is a self-described "" kindestperson,"" who has funded charities and medical clinics for thepoor in Pakistan.Pakistanis who have met him describe Khan as passionate about publicissues, always ready with an opinion on science, politics, religionand foreign affairs. At times garrulous and gregarious, Khan isdescribed as polite and witty. ""He is humble and notoutwardly arrogant,"" said Hassan Abbas, a former Pakistani security officialand author of "" Pakistan's Drift into Extremism.""But in his infrequent interviews and public statements, Khan has revealedanother side: He is a virulent Muslim nationalist with anIslamist's hatred of the United States, Israel and the West.""All the western countries, including Israel, are not only Pakistan's enemiesbut also enemies of Islam,"" he charged in a 1984interview. He called the U.S. effort to prevent the flowof nuclear technology around the globe ""part of the crusadeswhich the Christians and Jews had initiated against the Muslims1,000 years ago."" Like many Muslims, Khan has spoken ofa worldwide ""Zionist"" conspiracy to rob Muslim nations of theirpower and glory.In a 2001 interview, Khan said the longstanding rumors about hiswork in nuclear proliferation were ""unsubstantiated and fabricated lies"" fomentedby foreign governments ""because I disturbed all their strategic plans,the balance of power and blackmailing potential in this partof the world"" by building a nuclear arsenal for Pakistan.""I am not a madman or a nut,"" he added.U.S. and foreign intelligence agencies had long suspected Khan of runninga vast nuclear proliferation enterprise and, according to Secretary ofState Colin Powell, the Bush administration was ""well aware ofhis activities"" in 2001.In a recent paid speech after he left his post asCIA director, George Tenet said the CIA's involvement in breakingup A. Q. Khan's proliferation operation dated to 1997.""Working with British colleagues, we pieced together his subsidiaries, his clients,his front companies, his finances and manufacturing plants,"" Tenet said,according to an audiotape of the speech obtained by theNew York Times. ""We were inside his residence, inside hisfacilities, inside his rooms. We were everywhere these people were.""Tenet said the Khan operation stretched across three continents and calledthe bust ""one of the greatest success stories nobody evertalks about.""As U.S. and British intelligence worked to uncover the Khan network,the U.N.'s Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency proceeded on aparallel track. By the spring of 2003, Iranian leaders hadtold IAEA officials about a black market where they hadbeen buying nuclear material for the previous 18 years. TheIranians claimed they were working through middlemen and were notaware of the identity of the suppliers, according to MarkGwozdecky, the spokesman for IAEA.Around the same time, the Americans and British reaped the benefitsof the close surveillance of Khan's operations. They were trackingthe shipment of nuclear parts to Libya. Italy intercepted oncesuch shipment on a cargo ship in October 2003 thatwas carrying centrifuge parts. Confronted with the evidence, and givenLibya's desire to end longstanding economic sanctions, Tripoli confessed andrenounced its nuclear program.After Libya invited IAEA inspectors in December 2003, they uncovered atrove of incriminating evidence pointing to Khan.""Libya helps fill in the blanks. They were working directly withKhan and provided IAEA information about the actual supply chain,""Gwozdecky said.The IAEA believes Khan's network provided Libya with uranium hexafluoride, theraw material used in centrifuges to produce enriched uranium. Thenetwork also provided the industrial help necessary for Libya tomake its own uranium hexafluoride, as well as centrifuge andatomic bomb designs and machine shop equipment to service thecentrifuges.Much of this material has been dismantled in Libya and shippedto the United States where it is being studied atthe Energy Department's Oak Ridge, Tenn., facilities.Iran also received Khan's help on centrifuge technology, according to aCIA report to Congress. And the CIA says Khan soldnuclear materials to North Korea.At a minimum, Khan provided a turn-key nuclear bomb program toLibya, while greatly speeding up the nuclear program of Iran,a country that sponsors terrorist organizations.""Iran wouldn't be talking about getting nuclear weapons if it hadn'tbeen for Khan,"" said David Albright, a leading nuclear expertand president of the Institute for Science and International Security,a non-proliferation think-tank.Khan's centrifuge designs are particularly important to covert nuclear programs becausethey allow the development of bomb-making material with greater secrecy,compared with the gaseous diffusion method of producing U-235.""Centrifuge enrichment is much less energy-and-time consuming than gaseous diffusion, andyou can hide it a lot easier,"" said Henry Sokolski,executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center in Washington,D.C.U.S. intelligence and the U.N.'s Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency aretrying to determine whether A. Q. Khan or Iran, Libyaor North Korea shared nuclear know-how with third parties, likeal-Qaida. The terrorist group has been pursuing atomic weapons andhas said that it would use nuclear bombs against theUnited States.Shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, Pakistan detained two of itsnuclear scientists on suspicion that they shared nuclear information withOsama bin Laden, the al-Qaida chief. Although they were subsequentlyreleased, the CIA now believes that one of the scientists""may have provided some assistance to al-Qaida's program"" to acquirenuclear weaponry, the spy agency said in the recent reportto Congress.Based on documents recovered in Afghanistan, the agency described al-Qaida's atomicefforts ""rudimentary nuclear research, although the extent of its indigenousprogram is unclear.""Investigators are also trying to determine the extent of the Khannetwork and all of the companies around the globe thatmay have played a part. There are at least 30companies in 30 countries ""all over the globe involved inthis fantastic, sophisticated, illicit trafficking network with Mr. A.Q. Khanacting as CEO,"" according to Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, chief ofthe IAEA.Major elements of Khan's network have been uncovered in Malaysia andSouth Africa. Malaysian police arrested a Sri Lankan businessman --Bukhary Syed Abu Tahir -- who admitted shipping nuclear componentsto Iran and Libya at Khan's behest. Tahir also admittedreceiving two briefcases containing $3 million in cash from Iranin exchange for providing nuclear weapons material.In South Africa, authorities are investigating the sale of nuclear weaponstechnology to Libya through middlemen tied to Khan. Three individualsallegedly tied to the Khan network, including European nationals, werearrested as part of the South African investigation.Khan, the one person who could provide answers to the manypending questions, is out of reach of the IAEA andU.S. intelligence agencies. Pakistan has refused to allow intelligence officersto talk to Khan, while offering to relay written questionsto him. The problem with that arrangement is that investigatorscan't be sure whether it's Khan -- or someone else-- answering the questions.Nonetheless, a Vienna-based diplomat says the Pakistanis have been cooperative withU.S. and IAEA officials about disclosing what their investigators haveuncovered concerning Khan's operations. Cooperation between Pakistani government and theU.S. and IAEA ""has moved slowly but positively,"" he said.The IAEA wants to meet with Tahir, the Sri Lankan businessmancurrently in a Malaysian jail, to help officials frame betterquestions to Khan, the diplomat said. In addition, the IAEAhas requested permission from Islamabad to send its investigators toexamine Pakistan's uranium centrifuges. By comparing the Pakistan models withthose in Iran, the IAEA can conclusively determine whether Iran'scentrifuges originated in Pakistan.Given that the Pakistan military, headed by Gen. Pervez Musharraf, isall-powerful there and that A. Q. Khan was such ahigh-profile figure, some experts scoff at Musharraf's insistence that hedidn't know about Khan's nuclear black marketeering.Husain Haqqani, the former Pakistani ambassador to Sri Lanka, said inan interview that ""one would have to stretch the boundsof credulity to believe that the government wasn't involved.""""It's hard to believe that Pakistan's top scientist could travel toplaces like North Korea without the government's knowledge,"" he said.Robert Oakley, former U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, gives Musharraf and othersenior leaders the benefit of the doubt, speculating that thegeneral may have been shielded from full knowledge of Khan'sproliferation activities. ""Did Pakistan's military know something was going on?I'd say yes, Did they know everything? Probably not,"" hesaid.Oakley added that Khan's illicit export network wasn't a new creationbut rather reversed the flow of information and material onthe import network that Khan and the Pakistan military hadused to acquire nuclear materials for their country's atomic program.The assumption among some informed diplomats and intelligence officials is that,at a minimum, Khan must have had help from othersenior scientists in the Pakistani government.""Khan is a metallurgist, so he understood well about building centrifuges,""a Vienna-based diplomat said. ""But he wouldn't necessarily understand bombdesigns nor would he understand uranium conversion and the manyother technologies involved.""The Bush administration, always working to build-up Musharraf, has accepted hisclaims of innocence.Secretary of State Powell said that when he asked Musharraf ifhe had known about Khan's work, the general denied anyknowledge.Khan's nuclear network ""was so compartmented within government circles"" and Musharrafwas ""outside the circle,"" Powell said of Musharraf's explanation. ""That'swhat he has said to me, and I have noevidence to prove or disprove his statement.""All of which leads to the question of motive, another majorthrust in the IAEA investigation. While Khan profited financially fromthe sale of nuclear secrets, money likely was not thesole motivation.The IAEA's ElBaradei has said that ""ideology"" also played a factor.For example, Hassan Abbas, the former Pakistani security official, said Khanmay have been motivated by the strategic view held bysome Pakistani military leaders that spreading nuclear technology was away to counter U.S. power and what Islamabad fears isan emerging alliance among India, the United States and Israel.While Khan is not a religious extremist like bin Laden, hemay also have been motivated by a pan-Muslim view ofspreading weapons to guarantee the influence of Muslim countries.""Khan was motivated by some element of ideology, greed and convolutedstrategic thinking,"" said Haqqani, the former Pakistani diplomat.Another likely motivation is Khan's ample ego, said Oakley. ""It maybe a little of, 'Look at me. I am agreat man,""' Oakley said.Meanwhile, Khan passes time in his Islamabad estate, forbidden from publicspeaking.The Pakistani government has not said how long his limbo willlast, nor has it publicly explained the rules of whatKhan is allowed to do while under house arrest. Buthouse arrest has a unique history in Pakistani politics, namelyto take controversial individuals out of circulation, a penalty withoutsubstance, until the controversy blows over.""As far as Pakistani law is concerned, Khan has not beenconvicted of any crime. He has already been forgiven andpardoned,"" said Abbas. ""The house arrest isn't meant as apunishment but more as a sop to the Americans.""In Pakistan, Khan is often cast as a victim of Westernpressure on the Musharraf government.In a recent editorial, the Islamabad-based Pakistan Newswire summed up Musharraf'spredicament in the Khan case.""Why is a person still acknowledged by no less a personthan the president of Pakistan as a national hero beingsubjected to such humiliating treatment?"" the editorial asked. ""Surely, thefact that the man had to apologize to the entirenation was punishment enough.""E-mail: eric@hearst.com
Pakistani government said on Monday that Abdullah Q. Khan, thefounder of the nation's nuclear program, will not be interrogated byconcerned agencies from the United States.The Foreign Office spokesman Masood Khan told a weekly pressconference here that the Pakistani authorities have the ability tohandle the nuclear proliferation control.Earlier this month media reported that certain US officials suggestedthat ""the Nuke father,"" who was involved in an illegal transfer ofnuclear know-how to Iran, should be interrogated by the US authority.The spokesman said Pakistan has been cooperating well with theInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the nuclearproliferation control and there is no need to bring in the US aid inthe sector.A number of Pakistani scientists and officials had been detained forthe proliferation scandal since Abdullah Q. Khan confessed for hiswrong doing earlier this year.
","After being caught, A.Q. Khan, Pakistan's revered father of its nuclear deterrent, admitted in February to black market dealings in nuclear weapons technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea. He was pardoned, but remains under house arrest. Recent investigations found evidence that Khan delivered bomb blueprints and weapons-grade enriched uranium to Iran. He sold warhead blueprints to Libya and possibly to North Korea. Evidence surfaced of his vast global enterprise, his facilities in Dubai and South Africa, and international connections from Asia to Africa. Pakistan's government expressed skepticism over recent claims and refuses to allow foreign authorities question Khan. ","Abdul Qadeer Khan was a nuclear scientist who oversaw the spread of nuclear weapons to US adversaries. Khan did more to undermine US causes than Bin Laden, having confessed to transferring nuclear weapons technology to Iran, Libya, and North Korea. In November 2004 US officials and the UN's IAEA were still searching for other countries with Khan's digitized blueprints for nuclear manufacturing equipment and uranium enrichment centrifuges user manuals. Khan's network spread across 30 countries. Khan lives under house arrest in Islamabad. He was granted full pardon and allowed to keep the money believed to be from illicit sales. ","A.Q. Khan sold nuclear bomb technology and material to Iran, North Korea and Libya. Possible motives were profit, ego, and a guarantee of Muslim influence. He traded centrifuge technology to China for bomb design. Pakistan claims to cooperate with the international community and put Khan under house arrest but won't let him be questioned. President Musharraf pardoned Khan, let him keep his profits, and denied government involvement. The US, not wanting to alienate ally Pakistan, quarreled with the IAEA and is investigating separately. Khan chief lieutenant Tahir is in jail. Khan's network operated in over 30 countries, including South Africa. ","A.Q. Khan headed an illicit, global, network, providing nuclear information and material to at least Libya, Iran, and North Korea. He visited other potential customers and uranium suppliers. He appears motivated by hatred of India, monetary gain, egotism, and pan-Muslim and anti-Western goals. The US had tracked him for years and pressured his confession to nuclear proliferation in 2004, but could not be too forceful because of Pakistani cooperation in the war on terror. The Pakistani government placed Khan under house arrest, but pardoned him because he is a national hero. It denied any official knowledge of his activities. "
D0931,D0931-B,"The United States is investigating whether Pakistani scientist Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan sold nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia and other countries, Time magazine reported Sunday.The news weekly, citing a source in Pakistan's defense ministry, said that Khan, the father of Pakistan's nuclear bomb, had also played a bigger role in helping Iran and North Korea with their nuclear programs than had been previously disclosed.""US intelligence officials believe Khan sold North Korea much of the material needed to build a bomb, including high-speed centrifuges used to enrich uranium and the equipment required to manufacture more of them,"" Time said.Iran also may have bought centrifuges and weapons designs from Khan in the mid-1990s, Time said, adding that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had confirmed at least 13 meetings between 1994 and 1999 with representatives of Khan's network.Among the countries known to have been helped by Khan was Libya. Time said the Pakistani scientist had given the Libyans equipment for centrifuges and ""technical instructions for how to build a nuclear warhead.""Time said US and IAEA investigators believe Khan also traveled to Saudi Arabia and Egypt and to such African countries as Sudan, Ivory Coast and Niger.It said the purpose of those trips ""remains unclear."" ""But intelligence officials have hunches: Saudi Arabia and Egypt are believed to be in the market for nuclear technology, and many African countries are rich in raw uranium ore,"" the magazine said.Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has not allowed the United States or the IAEA to interrogate Khan directly, but the United States has submitted questions to him asking whether North Korea and Iran sold nuclear equipment to third parties, Time said.The magazine said the United States does not have ""concrete evidence"" that Khan did business with Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda network, but ""there is reason to suspect that such a link exists.""Members of Pakistan's military and intelligence establishment, which worked closely with Khan in his role as the government's top nuclear scientist, are known to sympathize with Osama bin Laden,"" the magazine said.Time also said that although the 68-year-old Khan is under house arrest in Pakistan and in failing health the Pakistani nuclear scientist's ""illicit network of suppliers and middlemen is still out there.""Khan appeared on Pakistani television in February 2004 and took full responsibility for transfers of nuclear technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea. Musharraf gave him a conditional pardon and has said that no government or military body was involved in the proliferation scandal.
Pakistan Monday dismissed as ""baseless"" a report in a US magazine that its disgraced top nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan sold sensitive equipment to Saudi Arabia.Information Minister Sheikh Rashid said the report in the latest edition of Time was full of distortion.""The story is without facts and baseless,"" he told AFP.The magazine reported that the United States was investigating whether Khan sold nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia and some other countries.The news weekly, citing a source in Pakistan's defense ministry, said Khan had also played a bigger role in helping Iran and North Korea with their nuclear programs than had been previously disclosed.""US intelligence officials believe Khan sold North Korea much of the material needed to build a bomb, including high-speed centrifuges used to enrich uranium and the equipment required to manufacture more of them,"" Time said.But Rashid said Islamabad was cooperating with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the world community by sharing the results of its own probe, which it said led to the dismantling of an illegal proliferation network.Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has not allowed the US or the IAEA to interrogate Khan, who appeared on Pakistani state television in February 2004 and took full responsibility for transfers of nuclear technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea.Musharraf gave him a conditional pardon and has said that no government or military body was involved in the proliferation scandal.The minister insisted that Pakistan would never hand over the father of Pakistan's nuclear bomb to any other country.
Pakistan Monday rejected a report that disgraced nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan sold equipment to Saudi Arabia but said its probe into a proliferation scandal centred on him was not over.Senior officials said Islamabad would look into any fresh evidence if it emerged but described the article in US weekly Time as baseless and a rehash of previous reports.""This is not correct,"" foreign ministry spokesman Masood Khan told reporters at a weekly briefing when asked if Khan, the father of Pakistan's atomic programme, had sold technology to fellow Muslim nation Saudi Arabia.""The allegation has been made several times in the past, but this is part of a disinformation campaign. It is baseless (and) does not have any substance,"" he added.""It is a rehash of several speculative stories which have appeared in the media in the recent past.""Abdul Qadeer Khan has been under effective house arrest since he appeared on Pakistan state television in February 2004 and took full responsibility for passing nuclear technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea.Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf gave him a conditional pardon and has said that no government or military body was involved in the scandal.But the military leader has steadfastly refused to allow the US or the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) to interrogate Khan.Time magazine, citing a source in Pakistan's defense ministry, said Khan had also played a bigger role in helping Ir without facts"".The minister and the spokesman both denied claims that 16 cylinders of uranium hexafluoride gas used for uranium enrichment were missing from the country's main enrichment facility, Khan Research Laboratories (KRL).""Our inventory is complete and nothing is missing from KRL,"" Rashid said.
Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi Thursday said his country was not going to hand over an alleged deputy of Pakistan's disgraced nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khah to anyone as investigations were still in progress.""No, there is no move to hand him over to anybody and he is still detained by us,"" Badawi told a press conference in Islamabad when asked if Buhary Syed Abu Tahir was being handed over to the United States.Tahir has been named by US President George W. Bush as ""deputy"" to Khan in an international nuclear trafficking ring.""Our... intelligence people like to speak and continue to talk to him. Obviously, there are lot of things we would like to know from him,"" Badawi said.Tahir told Malaysian police last year that Khan sold nuclear centrifuge parts to Iran in the mid-1990s and sent enriched uranium to Libya in 2001.Khan, a disgraced one-time national hero credited with making Pakistan a nuclear power, confessed in February 2004 to leaking nuclear secrets. He was later pardoned by President Pervez Musharraf.On the nuclear row between Iran and the United States, Badawi said, ""We do not want to see Iraq's situation repeated in Iran.""The United States accuses Iran of seeking to build nuclear weapons. Tehran has vehemently denied the charges, arguing that its atomic activities are solely for peaceful purposes.Last month Bush said he could not rule out using force if Tehran failed to rein in its nuclear plans, and US Vice President Dick Cheney said Iran was ""right at the top of the list"" of global troublespots.Badawi said that any differences between Iran and the United States ""should be resolved through diplomatic channel.""
Pakistan will not let any foreigners question Abdul Qadeer Khan, the father of the country's nuclear bomb who has admitted leaking secrets to states including North Korea, Foreign Minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri said Wednesday.""We have refused direct interrogations by anyone. The reason is national sensitivity,"" Kasuri told a press conference at the end of a three-day visit to Tokyo.Kasuri said Pakistan had acted against Khan even though the Pakistani opposition had accused the government of ""succumbing to international pressure"" against the local hero.""Actions have been taken (against Khan) and they are very strict. We are prepared... to investigate and share information,"" Kasuri said. He noted that Khan, who os effectively under house arrest, had interacted with foreigners when he leaked informaton of the country's nuclear technology.""In fact there were some foreigners involved. Pakistan has taken actions. Other foreigners, we hope actions will be taken against them by their governments,"" Kasuri said.Khan, who is credited with making Pakistan a nuclear power, confessed in February 2004 to leaking nuclear know-how to Iran, Libya and North Korea.Khan was later pardoned by President Pervez Musharraf, who has repeatedly refused to allow the United States or the International Atomic Energy Agency to question him.""We have shared information with the International Atomic Energy Agency,"" Kasuri said.""We have shared all information we had on any issue relevant to this (Khan) with the United States and friendly countries, definitely with the government of Japan,"" he said.""If there are new leads, we will investigate those,"" he added.Japan is locked in a standoff with North Korea over the Stalinist state's kidnapping of Japanese citizens. Pyongyang fired a missile over Japan into the Pacific Ocean in 1998.""We are sensitive to Japanese concerns. We will share any information we have relevant to your security,"" Kasuri said.
Pakistan's government on Monday rejected a media report that an internationalblack market in weapons technology, run by disgraced Pakistani scientist A.Q.Khan, may have sold equipment to Saudi Arabia and other Arabcountries.But while Information Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed described as ""baseless"" theallegations printed in this week's edition of Time magazine, he did not rule outthe possibility that Khan could have sold technology to more countries thaninitially thought.""We don't know of any other country that he gave nuclear technology to. But ifthere is another country, we will investigate,"" Ahmed told The Associated Press.""If there are any questions (for Khan) we will ask them.""Khan, once regarded as a national hero for his role in developing Pakistan'snuclear deterrent against rival India, has lived under virtual house arrest heresince he confessed in February 2004 to selling sensitive technology to Iran,Libya and North Korea.President Gen. Pervez Musharraf has pardoned Khan, and says the scientist'sinternational network has been dismantled. The government denies any officialinvolvement in the multimillion dollar (euro) illicit trade that earned Khan afortune _ estimated by Time at up to US$400 million (euro311million).The United States has submitted questions to Pakistan to ask Khan about whetherNorth Korea and Iran sold nuclear equipment to third parties, but authoritieshave apparently not allowed U.S. agents to interview Khan themselves.The Time report cited an unidentified Pakistani Defense Ministry official assaying that U.S. officials were investigating whether Khan's network might havesold nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries, such asEgypt.Foreign Ministry spokesman Masood Khan also denied the Time report. He alsodenied that Khan's network supplied Saudi Arabia with nucleartechnology.""The international black market network as far as it was related to Pakistan hasbeen dismantled. It has been neutralized,"" he said at a weekly news briefing inIslamabad.Khan blamed unnamed ""constituencies who launch and sustain this kind ofdisinformation campaign. Pakistan is a nuclear state and this is one of therisks that is involved in this status.""Ahmed said that Pakistan remained in contact with the Vienna-based U.N. nuclearwatchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, but reiterated that it wouldnot hand over the scientist for questioning by non-Pakistanis.""We have inquired as much as we can, if somebody has more questions, we areready to satisfy IAEA,"" he said. ""But there is no way to deliver A.Q. Khan toanyone.""He denied that Khan's network was still operating and one specific allegation inthe report that 16 cylinders of uranium hexafluoride gas _ a critical ingredientfor uranium enrichment for weapons _ had gone missing from Pakistan's leadingnuclear lab, the Khan Research Laboratories, named after thescientist.""There are no cylinders missing from KRL. The inventory is complete,"" Ahmedsaid.Last week, U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker told reporters that investigations intothe full scope of Khan's network were continuing, and that the United States waslooking forward to hearing the full results of Pakistan's inquiries.Khan, the foreign ministry spokesman, said Pakistan has shared the results ofits investigations ""transparently and candidly"" with the internationalcommunity.""I think it's a joint responsibility of the international community, all keyactors to act against proliferation,"" he said. ""That's why our investigationsare continuing and if fresh leads emerge we would like to check them out and iffresh evidence is furnished to us we would like to look intothat.""(pvs/sj)
Pakistan said Wednesday the case of disgraced nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan wasstill open but it has received no new evidence to suggest that his black marketnetwork had sold technology to more countries than earlier thought.Last February, President Gen. Pervez Musharraf pardoned Khan after he confessedto supplying sensitive technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea. But this weekTime magazine reported that U.S. officials were also investigating whether thescientist's network might have supplied Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries,such as Egypt.On Wednesday, Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Masood Khan said A.Q. Khan's""case is still open.""""We will quiz any of our scientists if somebody comes up with evidence to provehis links with the proliferators of nuclear technology,"" the spokesman told TheAssociated Press.But he said the government had ""received no new evidence from any country,individual or organization, including IAEA"" _ referring to the U.N. nuclearwatchdog, the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency.A.Q. Khan, who was once regarded as a national hero for his role in makingPakistan a nuclear power, has lived under virtual house arrest in Islamabad forthe past year.On Monday, Pakistan denied that Khan's network was still operating and denied aspecific allegation in Time magazine's report that 16 cylinders of uraniumhexafluoride gas _ a critical ingredient for uranium enrichment for weapons _had gone missing from Pakistan's main nuclear lab, the Khan ResearchLaboratories, named after the scientist.""As far as we are concerned, we have fulfilled our responsibility by dismantlingthis network from Pakistan, and we are quite vigilant and alert now,"" theForeign Ministry spokesman said Wednesday.He reiterated that Pakistan would not allow any country, individual or even theIAEA to interrogate its scientists. ""We are a responsible nuclear state, and wehave full confidence in our investigations system,"" he said.Pakistan denies there was any official involvement in Khan's illegal nucleartrading, which earned the scientist a fortune.
Editors: The following is now scheduled and will move shortly:IRAN-NUCLEAR -- WASHINGTON -- International investigators haveuncovered evidence of a secret meeting 18 years ago between Iranianofficials and associates of Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan thatresulted in a written offer to supply Tehran with the makings of anuclear weapons program, foreign diplomats and U.S. officials familiarwith the new findings said.1,580 words, by Dafna Linzer (Post).Includes Optional Trim.
Pakistan Monday dismissed as ""incorrect and unrealistic"" a US Time magazine report that the United States is investigating whether the father of Pakistan's nuclear bomb sold nuclear technologies to Saudi Arabia and other countries.Time magazine in its latest edition also claimed that Pakistan's Abdul Qadeer Khan network of suppliers and middlemen is still operational.""The Time has distorted the facts and made them sensationalize.There is no reality in the report and it is not based on facts,"" Information Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed told Geo television.He said Qadeer Khan has admitted to provide information to three countries but the Time story about selling technologies to Saudi Arabia or other Arab countries is incorrect.Rashid also rejected the magazine's claim that some cylinders have disappeared from Kahuta Research Laboratories (LRL), the country's major nuclear facility.""We have checked all the record and no cylinder is missing fromthe KRL. We are ready to remove apprehensions if there are any,"" Rashid said.Time magazine quoted sources as confirming that the United States has submitted questions to Qadeer Khan on whether the countries he allegedly provided nuclear secrets have sold such equipment to third parties.""We have solved Dr Qadeer Khan's issue and he will not be handed over to any country,"" Rashid said. He said there is no pressure on Pakistan on the issue and Pakistan is in touch with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).At a weekly news briefing, Foreign Office spokesman Masood Khanalso categorically denied the magazine's story, saying the report is ""highly speculated.""He added that Pakistan is still fully investigating the Qadeer Khan case and shares the results with the United States and the European countries. ""We have not closed the investigation,"" the spokesman said.
Pakistan's nuclear assets are under foolproof security parameters and their safety can be surelyguaranteed, said Pakistani foreign office spokesman Wednesday.""All the allegations raised against Pakistan by the Time Magazine report are baseless and unfounded,"" Masood Ahmed Khan said at a PTV program.He said Pakistan had established Command and Control Authority,Strategic Plan Division and Strategic Forces bringing everything into a parameter of reliable intelligence mechanism.Besides, Pakistan had been in constant contact with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its role in breakingthe international nuclear black market was acknowledged and appreciated by the world community.""There is no chance of the transfer of nuclear information or technology from Pakistan to any other country,"" he said.When asked about the investigation into Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan, Masood said Pakistan had thoroughly investigated the case against Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan and his associates, and proper security measures had been taken on the basis of results obtained through investigation.He said further investigation in this regard could be made onlywhen there was solid evidence. Rumors and speculations cannot be taken into account in this regard.The latest edition of the US-based Time Magazine alleged that the nuclear international black market of Qadir Khan is still operational.
","New evidence surfaced indicating A.Q. Khan sold nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia and other countries. He also played a bigger role than previously disclosed in Iran's and North Korea's nuclear programs, delivering bomb-building materials, including high-speed centrifuges and designs. Investigators believe he's traveled to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Sudan, Ivory Coast and Niger. The purpose of the trips is unclear. Khan's deputy, in custody in Malaysia, has provided information of his activities. Pakistan dismissed recent evidence as baseless, but said its probe into Khan's activities continues. Foreign authorities are still banned from questioning him, but Pakistani authorities relay questions to him. ","International investigators uncovered evidence showing that Q.A. Khan agreed to sell Iran a nuclear weapons program 18 years ago. In February 2005 Time reported that the US was investigating whether QA Khan sold nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia and other countries and that Khan had also played a bigger role in helping North Korea with nuclear programs than had been previously reported. The article said the US suspects Khan did business with Al-Qaeda but lacks concrete evidence. Pakistan dismissed the article as baseless, without facts, and full of distortion. ","The US is investigating whether Khan sold nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia and Egypt, believed to be in the market. Pakistan denied the disappearance of 16 of its cylinders of uranium hexafluoride gas, used for uranium enrichment. Khan's network of suppliers and middlemen still exists. There is no concrete evidence that Khan did business with Al-Qaeda. Khan's illicit trade earned him $400 million. Malaysia refuses to hand over Abu Tahir. Khan associates met secretly with Iranian officials 18 years ago and offered in writing to supply Iran with nuclear weapons material. Iran insists its atomic activities are for peaceful purposes. ","In February 2005, Time magazine reported that A. Q. Khan also had provided nuclear equipment to Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations. It stated that Khan had earned up to $400 million and his network was still active. The magazine also reported that cylinders of a gas, critical to uranium enrichment, were missing from a Pakistani nuclear laboratory. Pakistani officials called the report baseless and part of a disinformation campaign. "
D0932,D0932-A,"Kenya is being swamped with a flood of discarded plastic shopping bags that pose a growing public health risk and should take steps to ban the popular lould be banned and a hefty levy slapped on thicker ones to rid Kenya of an increasing environmental and health menace,""  the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) said.The call came in a study of Kenya's solid waste management presented to UNEP governors who are currently meeting at the agency's headquarters here and was backed by Wangari Maathai, last year's Nobel Peace Prize.Discarded plastic bags ""provide several million habitats for mosquitoes to breed that increase the risk of malaria,"" she said, noting that the disease was a leading cause of infant mortality in Kenya and throughout Africa.Maathai, who serves as Kenya's deputy environment minister, pledged to push the Kenyan government to adopt measures to reduce the use of plastic bags.Earlier this week, Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki told UNEP officials that his government would address the problem posed by the bags but Maathai said she wanted action now.""If I had my way, we would have started that immediately"" she told reporters.In addition to exacerbating the mosquito problem, plastic bags block gutters and drains, choke farm animals and marine wildlife, pollute the soil, can ruin Kenya's dramatic natural vistas and can take 20 to 1,000 years to decompose.In Europe, Ireland introduced a similar bid to cut down the use of plastic bags in March 2002, then dubbed a ""plastax"". By August that year, shoppers had already cut the use of plastic bags by 90 percent, the environment ministry announced.The government announced that the funds raised from a tax on plastic bags would be used for an office for environment enforcement, implementing a national waste prevention programme and the disposal of fridges and freezers.Rwanda and South Africa are moving towards a similar policy, according to UNEP officials.The state-run Kenya Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis (KIPPRA) and National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) said at least two million plastic bags a year were being distributed to shoppers in Nairobi alone, many of which were not disposed of properly.More than 48 million thin plastic bagsng at a rate of 10 percent per year to feed massive consumer demand at home and in neighboring countries, the study said.
Parts of Eritrea once littered by a sea of flimsy shopping bags are being cleaned up thanks to a new law that entered into force in January to help the Horn of Africa country protect nature.In the capital Asmara and other outlying regions, the bags have been replaced by the cotton and nylon and Eritreans have no choice but to adapt to instead.Since January, ""those who import, produce, distribute or sell plastic bags are fined,"" said Wolde Yohannes, the head of environment wing in the ministry of land, water and environment.Wolde did not give the amount of the fine, but several sources estimated that offenders can pay several thousands of nakfa.Since a dollar here is worth 15 nakfa, such fines are hefty in the country where, according to an International Monetary Fund report, annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is 130 dollars (100 euros).Authorities here are indeed determined to stem the problem.Individuals are not fined if they are caught with a plastic bag. They simply have to tell the authorities where they got the bag from, explained Wolde.""If we find that individuals don't cooperate, they could also be fined,"" said Kibrom Asmarom, an official in the environment department.Kibrom expressed satisfaction on people's respect on the law, nevertheless.Authorities had a raft of reasons for declaring war on the flimsy bags that not only block gutters and drains, choke farm animals and marine wildlife, pollute the soil, but also ruin dramatic natural vistas and can take 20 to 1,000 years to decompose.""The animals were eating the plastic bags and dying,"" Wolde said. Loss of livestock can be depressing in this poor country that regulary suffers from bouts of drought.""The bags used to clog the drainage pipes. And they were thrown everywhere, got stuck in the trees, and spoiled the landscape,"" he added.As animals were dying and drainage getting choked before the law came into force, some areas around Asmara used to be covered by a sea of coloured plastic bags. Unwittingly, goats and sheep chewed them, the officials said.Authorities had better plans for the outlawed papers.""We don't burn them, factories which make plastic use them for other purposes,"" said Wolde.""Only a few people have complained about this ban,"" he added.With a threat of fine, Eritrean in the streets of Asmara have no choice but to abide by this environmentally friendly law.Others have even forgotten that plastic bags did exist and littered their streets and trash-dumbing zones, just before January.""People have already forgotten about plastic bags, they've moved on to other things,"" quipped one Eritrean.While Eritrea has kicked out plastics, a much needed backing from  anti-plastic campaign rang at UN Environment Programme governor's meeting in Kenya last week, with Nobel Peace Laureate Wangari Maathai leading a league to ban the flimsy types.Discarded plastic bags ""provide several million habitats for mosquitoes to breed that increase the risk of malaria,"" she said, noting that the disease was a leading cause of infant mortality in Kenya and throughout Africa.While in Europe, Ireland introduced a similar bid to cut down the use of plastic bags in March 2002, then dubbed a ""plastax"". By August that year, shoppers had already cut the use of plastic bags by 90 percent, the environment ministry announced.
City officials are considering charging grocery stores 17 cents eachfor grocery bags to discourage use of plastic sacks.More than 90 percent of consumers choose plastic bags, which areblamed for everything from clogging recycling machines to killingmarine life and suffocating infants. But the fee would also apply topaper bags to help reduce overall waste.Promoting a healthy environment ""means we need to help changepeople's patterns, and that even means their shopping patterns,"" saidincoming city Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi, who takes office in January.""This is a sensible user fee.""The city's Commission on the Environment will consider the proposalTuesday. Mayor Gavin Newsom is reviewing the idea.The city's Department of the Environment estimates San Franciscocustomers bring home about 50 million bags each year. That accountsfor about 2 percent of waste, at an annual cleanup cost of about $8.4million (euro6.45 million).Grocers and the plastics industry oppose the measure.""We think essentially it's an unnecessary and misguided approach,""said Tim Shestek, spokesman for the American Plastics Council. ""Thistax is going to hurt those who can least afford it.""State legislators defeated a bill last year that would have charged 2cents on each non-recyclable disposable bag.The San Francisco proposal parallels efforts in Ireland, SouthAfrica, Bangladesh, Australia, Shanghai and Taiwan, which ban plasticbags or charge a fee to use them.
In San Francisco, the free grocery bag soon might go the way of thefull-service gas station.City officials are considering charging grocery stores 17 centsapiece for the bags, 90 percent of which are plastic -- and areblamed by environmentalists for everything from clogging recyclingmachines to killing marine life and suffocating infants.Although the environmentalists are not as concerned about the effectof recyclable paper bags on the environment, the proposal wouldinclude them, too, with the idea of reducing waste in general.In turn, the fee would be passed on to the consumer. Proponents ofthe surcharge hope this will persuade shoppers to give up theconvenience of the disposable sack.""Yes, it's going to be a pain the ass, but that's part of the point,""said Mark Murray, executive director of Californians Against Waste.""One thing we've learned is that sending a financial signal to themarketplace tends to modify behavior much better than voluntaryapproaches.""Trade groups representing grocers and the plastics industrypredictably aren't crazy about the idea.""We think essentially it's an unnecessary and misguided approach,""said Tim Shestek, spokesman for the American Plastics Council. ""Thistax is going to hurt those who can least afford it.""The proposal, set to be considered by the Commission on theEnvironment on Tuesday, imitates efforts around the world to stem theuse of plastic bags -- known in China as ""white pollution."" Ireland,South Africa, Bangladesh, Australia, Shanghai and Taiwan are just afew of the places where the government either bans plastic bagsoutright or charges a fee to use them.Trade groups contend that the results of those efforts are mixed. InIreland, for example, there is anecdotal evidence of increasedshoplifting as people bring in their own bags and higher sales ofboxes of plastic bags, which consumers use for everything from petwaste to trash cans.Murray said the local effort is the first in California after anAssembly bill to levy a statewide 2-cents charge on nonrecyclabledisposable bags failed last year.""We've attempted to pursue this at a state level, but the lobbyistsfor the retail industry are too strong,"" he said.After being considered by the commission, the proposal would move tothe mayor's office or the Board of Supervisors in search oflegislative sponsors. A spokesman for Mayor Gavin Newsom said themayor is reviewing it. Meanwhile, the proposal has at least onepotential champion on the Board of Supervisors, the newly electedRoss Mirkarimi, who helped found the city's Department of theEnvironment, which is overseen by the Commission on the Environment.""We all have a responsibility to promote a healthy and sustainableenvironment, and by doing that, it means we need to help changepeople's patterns, and that even means their shopping patterns,"" saidMirkarimi, who will take office in January. ""This is a sensible userfee.""The proposal, which takes the form of a resolution urging the mayorand board to take action, also suggests expanding the surcharge inthe future beyond grocers to include drug stores, dry cleaners,newspapers and other retailers.According to the Department of the Environment, consumers lug homeabout 50 million bags from San Francisco grocery stores each year. Ofthose, 90 percent are nonrecyclable plastic.A report prepared in support of the proposal by Robert Haley,recycling program manager for the environment department, saysplastic bags gum up recycling and composting machines at Norcal --San Francisco's waste management provider -- resulting in $1 millionin extra costs and lost revenue from the sale of recyclablematerials.The bags account for 2 percent of the city's total ""waste stream,""and picking up and disposing littered bags cost an additional $7.4million annually, according to the report.It notes that an estimated 12 million barrels of oil go into theproduction of plastic bags, while 14 million trees are felled to maketheir paper counterparts.Paul Smith, vice president of the California Grocers Association,said the proposal is strongly opposed by the industry group.""We're not sure where it came from or ... where the 17 cents is goingto go. There's not really a lot of accountability,"" Smith said.According to the proposal, grocers would be able to keep half of thefee and would be expected to spend it on city-approved programs, suchas discounted reusable shopping bags.Shestek, the American Plastics Council spokesman, said some of thecosts attributed to plastic bags could be recouped by sending plasticbag waste to companies that can use it as a raw material, such asdecking and composite lumber producers.Heidi Melander, president of the Northern California RecyclingAssociation, a supporter of the proposal, said the fee was a tangibleway the public can participate in helping reduce waste.""We've been trained to want bags,"" she said. ""It's gotten out of hand-- everywhere you go, they force them on you, and they think you'reweird if you don't take a bag. We might not have control over theblister packaging around the electronic equipment we buy. But we havecontrol over taking that bag.""
I've gotten more than 70 e-mails responding to my Tuesday columnabout the San Francisco Commission on the Environment's resolution urgingthe Board of Supervisors to force supermarkets in the cityto charge shoppers 17 cents apiece for bags.Roughly one-third of these readers love the idea, saying it willcut down on waste and trash. Some say the proposaldoesn't go far enough, that fees should apply to otherstores and bags.Roughly one-third hate the idea, saying it's a government plot toraise taxes.The remaining third might warm to the idea, but have somequestions and reservations.Today, I'll share some of these comments, but after this, please,no more feedback on bag fees.-- The European scene: More than a dozen e-mails came frompeople who live or have lived in Germany, Switzerland, Ireland,Norway or South Africa, where charging for shopping bags iscommon. Virtually all of them said it's a minor expenseor inconvenience, but well worth it.""My native Germany charges a fee for these bags, and peoplerespond in the best way for the environment -- theybring their own tote bags! When I came to theU.S. seven years ago, I was astonished (and disgusted) bythe practice of using new bags on each trip. Andwhile I have to admit that I easily fell intothis behavior myself, the proposed legislation reminded me that bringingmy own tote bag is an easy way to bea good citizen of our one and only planet Earth,""says Franziska Marks.""I am an Irish citizen living in S.F. I remember thesame excuses being trotted out when this was first introducedin Ireland (in 2002). The key difference is that theretailers embraced this change as a way to tout their'green' credentials by offering a free, sturdy shopping tote toeach club member for a limited time to carry theirgroceries (enabling free advertising). It really has dramatically reduced thelevel of plastic bag waste all over the country,"" writesRay Walsh.-- Pooper scoopers: Many readers told me they put their oldbags to good use. One even sent me a photoof her kitchen recycling center, rigged to hold plastic bags.""Everybody I know uses plastic grocery bags for garbage bags. Theyuse them to go to the dog park, empty thekitty litter, and a dozen other things. If you don'tget plastic bags with your groceries, then you would haveto buy plastic bags. So it sort of defeats thepurpose,"" writes Jim Knowles of Alameda.""Considering the estimated 85,000 dogs in San Francisco, has anyone factoredthe additional citywide expense in cleaning up poo that peoplewill refuse to pick up in a 17-cent bag threetimes a day?"" asks Melinda Graves.""For about eight years, I have reused bags many times becauseI want to do my part for our environment. Infact, for one month, I kept count of how manytimes I reused a single bag. Seventeen times in onemonth meant that 17 bags were not sent to thedump!"" writes Charlotte Pederson.I feel a book coming on: ""101 Uses for Old Bags.""-- Fuzzy math? My column explained that the San Francisco Departmentof the Environment came up with the 17 cents bydividing the environmental cost of used grocery bags ($8.5 millionannually) by the estimated number of plastic and paper bagsdistributed in San Francisco supermarkets each year (50 million).The $8.5 million is the departments' estimate of what it coststhe city to sweep up and dispose of bags, pluswhat it costs Norcal Waste Systems to remove plastic bagsfrom its recycling and composting system.Some readers point out that city residents already pay for thesecosts through taxes and garbage-collection fees.""Shouldn't the amount that is presently being paid for garbage servicebe taken into consideration when determining how much it reallycosts the city? Or are residents supposed to pay twicefor the same service?"" asks David Schnapf.Engineer Neil Lillemark says the city's calculation ignores two facts: Someof the 50 million bags distributed each year get reusedand don't go immediately into the waste stream, and afee would cut bag consumption (and thus the city's costs).Using certain assumptions, he suggests that ""10 cents a bag wouldbe a more fair estimate of the charge which shouldbe applied if they were to go this route.""Some readers suggested it would be more economically efficient to banfree bags, but to allow grocers to sell them forthose who forget or choose not to use their own.That would eliminate the cost of creating a system tocollect, track and distribute the fees.Mark Westlund, spokesman for the environment department, said the 17-cent feeis not set in stone, and if a bag feewent into effect, a reduction in taxes and/or garbage fees""certainly could be on the table."" He adds that thedepartment ""would be open to any ideas that would addressthe issue.""-- Bad bagger behavior: Several readers said grocers could reduce wasteif they simply instructed their baggers to use fewer sacks.""Baggers can be careless, often double bagging for no reason, orputting one or two items in a bag that couldhave fit into another bag. It's probably faster to usea lot of bags instead of trying to figure outhow to make the best use of each bag, butit's so wasteful,"" says Sarah Stockton of Daly City.Paul Smith, a vice president of the California Grocers Association, explains:""We try to minimize breakage to product."" If a bagbreaks when a customer is moving it from store tocar or car to kitchen, most stores that are membersof his association will replace the contents for free.""There are marketing reasons why we do this,"" he says. However,""There are retailers who are right now evaluating their clerkand bagger training to (encourage) reduction of bags.""-- Good question: Ford Kanzler of El Granada writes: ""I've oftenwondered why food markets don't sell reusable cloth bags atthe check stand (along with) all the impulse-purchase junk.""-- Who knows where that bag has been? Mike McHugh fearsreusing bags may be unhealthful.""A new bag is clean! Customers can return home with theiritems confident that their purchases have been protected from dirtand germs. An old reused bag cannot guarantee such asituation. It may be dirty, even if you can't seethe dirt with your eyes. It might have held rawmeat that may have bled ever so little onto thesides of the bag. The bag might even have previouslybeen used to carry poisonous substances!"" he writes.Point of interest: When Ireland imposed a 15-cent charge on allplastic shopping bags in 2002, it exempted a number ofbags, including those that hold raw meat.-- Why just supermarkets? Some readers wonder why the proposal appliesonly to grocers.""Saving the environment can be done in many ways,"" writes CatherineYing. ""Instead of making our life more complicated by chargingfor shopping bags, why don't we start with something thatis more of a luxury, such as Diaper Genie,"" whichwraps dirty disposable diapers in plastic bags.""What about stores like Walgreens that try to put every littleitem in a bag -- even if the customer isa woman with a large handbag,"" writes Beth Wells ofSan Francisco. And how about restaurants that put food ""inthose toxic Styrofoam boxes and then put the box ina bag.""""What bugs me is that my Chronicle is delivered every dayin a plastic bag. They are limited in their re-use-- I don't have a dog and don't travel thatoften, as they make excellent wrappers for shoes or slippers,""writes Doug Stewart.Chris Blaser, The Chronicle's circulation vice president responds: ""Our policy isto only deliver newspapers in plastic bags on rainy/heavy fogdays. Our other general rule is to bag when theforecast is mixed.""We do, however, have some carriers who bag more frequently (oftheir own initiative) in an effort to assure that thepaper is in good condition. We do notify any ofthese carriers to stop bagging (except on rainy days) wheneverwe receive a call from a customer. We also makesure the plastic bags we buy come primarily from recycledmaterials.""Westlund says the city might consider extending bag fees ""to otherareas like fast foods, drug stores, etc. Right now (it's)strictly supermarkets.""
LOS ANGELES - Paper or plastic? It might not matter soon.Supermarket shoppers could end up paying for selecting either bag ifLos Angeles politicians follow a San Francisco proposal -- andthe advice of some environmentalists -- to recoup the costof cleaning up grocery-sack litter.San Francisco officials are considering a fee of 17 cents perbag in a bid to encourage Bay Area shoppers tobring their own sacks.Los Angeles city leaders also want to get rid of grocery-bagblight. Hoping to avoid drastic measures, Councilman Ed Reyes wantsmanufacturers of plastics and officials in grocery chains to partnerwith him on bag cleanups and recycling programs.""San Francisco has the wherewithal to charge that much. San Franciscohas a different income group,"" Reyes said. ""Here in LosAngeles, I would rather work with the industry before weget into that.""Reyes' proposal to create a task force on plastic bags willlikely go to the full City Council next week afterbeing approved Wednesday by the council's Environmental Quality and WasteManagement Committee. Reyes hopes the task force will hold itsfirst meeting in March and produce recommendations 60 days later.So far, plastics-industry representatives have said they will participate in Reyes'task force -- particularly in light of the proposed feein San Francisco, which they oppose.""The bag manufacturers in the last few years have gotten togetherand realize there is an issue,"" said Donna Dempsey, executivedirector of the Film and Bag Federation. ""We're willing towork toward that goal.""All sides agree that plastic bags are a blight on theLos Angeles River, where hundreds of white sacks float onthe shallow water, stick to rocks and dangle like Spanishmoss from tree branches.City officials were spurred to action by a new mandate tocut trash from the river and from Ballona Creek by10 percent each year, starting this year, at an estimatedcost of $120 million.Plastics make up more than half of all the trash inthe river, and plastic bags alone constitute slightly more thanone-third of the litter.Unlike paper or wood or other organic garbage, plastics don't biodegrade.They cause environmental damage by breaking into smaller pieces thatare eaten by fish and wildlife. Plastic bags also clogthe screens installed on storm drains that filter trash fromrunoff.""Plastic is the single most important component of the litter. It'salso the most environmentally damaging,"" said Kosta Kaporis, an engineerwith the Bureau of Sanitation. ""It's aesthetically the worst.""Los Angeles River ad hoc committee staffer Lupe Vela is incharge of task force preparation and hopes to bring industryrepresentatives to the table first to see if they candevelop voluntary programs.Right now only about 5 percent of the plastic used ingrocery bags is recycled. Some grocery stores have bins inwhich to deposit used bags, and some offer a discount-- 5 cents or less -- for shoppers who bringtheir own bags.And bags can't be mixed with curbside recyclables. They stick tobottles and cans, and they clog sorting equipment. Yet thereis a demand for the raw material by companies thatuse old sacks to make more bags or plastic buildingmaterials.The task force will likely talk about ways to collect andrecycle bags. Members are virtually certain to consider public-education campaignsto get people to stop littering, to bring their ownreusable bags when they shop, and to participate in neighborhoodcleanup programs.But some question whether voluntary, public-private programs will deliver the kindof dramatic cut in plastic litter that is needed forthe city of Los Angeles to meet trash regulations.""I'm skeptical that the plastics industry is going to be capableof coming up with a solution that involves fewer numbersof plastic bags being sold,"" said Mark Murray, executive directorof Californians Against Waste, which has pushed San Francisco andLos Angeles authorities to consider fee-per-bag systems.He points to the success in Ireland, where use of plasticbags dropped by 90 percent a year after the nationimposed a fee of 15 cents per bag.Though Reyes champions the partnership with industry and the community now,he said he is open to tougher means to getbags out of the Los Angeles River.""Maybe we'll come up with a fine or a tax forthe plastic bags, and give the bag some value, sopeople will think twice before throwing it on the streets.""X X X
The Rwandan government has launched a national war against plasticbags as an attempt to maintain the environment and clean up thecountry, President Paul Kagame told reporters Monday.Kagame who participated in the clean-up of the Kigali city said thathis government had endorsed the ban on all plastic bags and anyonewho still owns them ought to face penalties.""We want people to use traditional baskets and give the land abreathing space,"" Kagame said.""We have a real problem with plastic and we are linking this with ourefforts to protect our rivers and lakes,"" Mugorewera Drocella,minister of lands and environment told reporters.However, shop owners feel the government's decision was to hostileand too heavy for them. ""We have now resorted to using newspapers aspacking bags until the government shows us what to be used,"" onebusinessman in the capital city Kigali said.
The Ugandan government is considering a total ban on polythene bagsafter a 50 percent excise duty has failed to reduce their productionand usage, reported local press on Tuesday.Minister of State for Trade Richard Nduhura was quoted as saying thatthe rampant use of polythene bags has led to environmental disasterslike blockage of drainages, suffocation of children and animals andsoil degradation.""An excise duty of 50 percent was imposed on plastics in June 2002.It has not deterred indiscriminate use of the plastics, prompting usto take drastic measures,"" Nduhura said at a meeting on plasticswaste management and development of environmentally- degradableplastics in Kampala which was attended by delegates from eightAfrican countries.He added that the government was still looking at optional measureslike controlling importation, production, usage and disposal ofpolythene bags.
Uganda will soon ban the manufacture and importation of plastic bags and impose a hefty levy on thicker ones, an environment official has said.Dr. Aryamanya Mugisha, head of Uganda National Environment Management Authority (NEMA), was quoted on Monday by local press as saying that the measure would get rid of the increasing environmental and health menace.""We are banning polythene bags and it is a matter of time for them to become history,"" Mugisha said on Sunday in Nairobi, Kenya where he is heading a NEMA delegation.He said that the NEMA had made recommendations to the cabinet to ban the plastic bags about five years ago.Mugisha said a ban on plastic bags is among proposals aimed at reducing the use of polythene, adding that but the tax imposed on the plastic bags about two years ago has not helped in restrictingtheir use because their price is still very low.He said he expected the ban on plastic bags to be effected later this year.Rwanda imposed a ban on the manufacture and importation of polythene bags last year, while the United Nations Environment Program is working with the Kenyan government to ban plastic bags there in a new waste management strategy.Uganda is one of the few countries in the Great Lakes region where plastic bags are not regulated. Sources blamed the delay in effecting the decision on ban the manufacture and importation of plastic bags on the lack of political will and protecting those who have invested heavily in plastic bags.
Tanzania is on the way to handle the increasing plastic waste through establishing a recycling plant believed to be the first one in east and central Africa.Minister for Industry and Trade Juma Ngasongwa was quoted by local newspaper Daily News on Thursday as saying that the Tanzanian government has set aside 1.5 million US dollars to operate the recycling plant as the first phase of the country's multi-million-dollar anti-plastic litter project.The plant is expected to start operating in May this year, withthe capacity of recycling every day about 10 tons of plastic bags,bottles and other industrial waste from collection centers.Plastic litter has become an environmental hazard in the east African country where the public have not been made aware of disposal methods. The abandoned plastic bags and containers can bespotted in many towns, blamed for clogging sewage and drainage systems. It is also reported that cows died after eating this material.
","Iceland, South Africa, Bangladesh, Australia, Shanghai and Taiwan have all banned or heavily taxed plastic bags. Eritrea has enacted fines for all who import, produce, distribute, or sell them. Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda are all considering bans or taxes as are the citizens of San Francisco and Los Angeles. In Rwanda some citizens consider the government too hostile and ask ""what should we use instead"". A survey in San Francisco found about 1/3 supporting a tax, 1/3 opposed and 1/3 somewhat open minded. Grocers and plastic industry personnel are opposed while environmentalists support the tax. ","San Francisco is considering charging grocery stores 17 cents per bag. Grocers could keep half and use it on approved programs. Grocers and the plastics industry are opposed. Public reaction is mixed. State legislators defeated a 2 cent charge last year. Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, South Africa, Bangladesh, Australia, Shanghai, Taiwan, and Eritrea ban plastic bags or charge a fee or fine for their use. In Ireland plastic bag use dropped 90 percent. Uganda, Kenya, and Rwanda are planning or considering banning or taxing plastic bags. Rwanda urges traditional basket use. Shop owners object. Tanzania is establishing a recycling plant. ","Governments around the world are taking steps to control the blight of plastic bags. Basic steps are collecting and recycling, education programs, clean-ups, and building recycling plants. Other nations are placing taxes or fees on the use of these bags. The ""plastax"" is common in Europe and decreased the use of plastic bags in Ireland by 90% in one year. California cities are investigating this tax. The strongest step is banning the importation, production, and distribution of these bags including enforcement and high fines. Producers and merchants are opposed to taxes and bans. The general population's reactions are mixed. ","Many countries including Ireland, South Africa, Bangladesh, Australia, Shanghai, Taiwan, Rwanda and Eritrea, have either banned plastic bags or charged a fee for their use. After Ireland imposed a fee of 15 cents a bag, their usage dropped by 90%. Some Rwandan shop owners have resorted to making bags out of newspapers. The U.S. has been slow to do anything. San Francisco was considering charging 17 cents a bag - a move opposed by grocers and the plastic industry. Los Angeles is considering a task force to consider ways to collect and recycle bags and to implement public education campaigns. "
D0932,D0932-B,"Japan announced a draft plan Monday to stop retailers from giving out plastic bags for free amid efforts to improve the environment in the nation where the landmark Kyoto Protocol was sealed.The proposal by the environment ministry would cut back on Japan's widespread use of plastic bags either through legislation or agreements with industry to end free distribution.""If everything goes as scheduled, the bill to ban free distribution of plastic bags will be sent to the parliament in 2006 at the earliest,"" an environment ministry official said.The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry plans to present its own report on the bag issue on Thursday after which the two ministries will finalize details.Plastic bags are regularly distributed without asking by Japanese merchants. According to a survey by the Kyoto government, 10 percent of the plastic garbage in the western city comes from bags given by retailers.""There are no similar nationwide statistics, but we expect charging for plastic bags will reduce a significant amount of garbage from households,"" the environment ministry official said.The Japanese government faces an uphill battle to meet its target under the Kyoto Protocol of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions six percent by 2008-2012 from the 1990 level. It hopes to achieve the goal partly by reducing the amount of household rubbish.
Kenya's largest supermarket chain said Wednesday it has begun using new biodegradable bags in response to growing environmental concerns about pollution by discarded flimsy plastic shopping containers.""We are trying to keep away any hazards and it's also part of our social responsibility to care for the environment,"" said Mercury Anyango, a spokeswoman for Nakumatt, Kenya's leading retailer of groceries and household products.The biodegradable bags, which were launched last week, are also plastic but specially treated to make them decompose more quickly than older versions which can 1,000 years to disintegrate, she told AFP.""Nakumatt started using the new product because the normal plastic bag is a problem for the evironment and has therefore chosen to support the world environment program by using the degradable bags for packing goods,"" she added.Nakumatt uses more than 30 million bags every year at a cost of over 40 million shillings (524 million dollars) and Anyango said the change will cost 20 percent more.In February, the Nairobi-based UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and Kenyan Nobel Peace laureate Wangari Maathai warned that Kenya faced a growing public health risk from the sea of bags swamping the country.Plastic shopping bags that are not disposed of properly block gutters and drains, choke farm animals and marine wildlife and pollute the soil, they said.In addition, they ""provide several million habitats for mosquitoes to breed that increase the risk of malaria,"" Maathai said at the time, noting that the disease was a leading cause of infant mortality in Kenya and throughout Africa.According to the state-run Kenya Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis (KIPPRA) and the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA), at least two million plastic bags are distributed each year to people shopping in supermarkets and kiosks in Nairobi alone.
India's western state of Maharashtra banned the sale and use of plastic bags Wednesday, saying they were the main cause of blocked drains during week-long floods which killed 1,099 people.Environmentalists and urban planners have blamed the flooding caused by unprecedented monsoon rains in the state's capital Mumbai in July on poor drainage.""These (plastic bags) tend to choke drainage and sewage systems. The cabinet has now decided to ban the sale and usage of plastic bags in the state,"" the state's Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said at the state assembly.""In the recent floods, the collected water could not flow out properly due to poor drainage systems,"" he said.Mumbai, a city of 15 million people and the financial and entertainment capital of the country, has a century-old drainage system built by India's former British colonial rulers.The poor drainage system clogged with plastic bags and garbage combined with unchecked development along natural inland waterways, Deshmukh said.""The situation will not improve until we stop using plastic bags,"" he said.People had to wade through stagnant water during the floods which led to the outbreak of water-borne diseases across Mumbai and neighbouring areas, killing more than 315 people after the water receded.However, companies can continue to make plastic bags in the state as long as they are sold elsewhere, Deshmukh said.""The manufacture of plastic will be allowed (in Maharashtra) and these may be sold only outside the state,"" Deshmukh said.A period of 30 days would be provided to hear public opinion and suggestions, he added.The plastics manufacturing industry said it would oppose the government's move.""Plastics usage is not the culprit. The civic administration failed to ensure proper roads and effective drainage systems. If plastics usage was the issue, why was south Mumbai not flooded,"" said Harpal Singh, president of the Plastics manufacturing industry nationwide.There are 1,800 small units manufacturing plastic bags across the country, Singh said.
Taiwan conservationists Tuesday protested at a government decision partially to lift a ban on free plastic bags, saying the move is a setback for environmental protection efforts.The cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) announced Monday that from March 1, private restaurants will be allowed to distribute plastic bags to customers free of charge.""This is a big step backward in domestic environmental education,"" said Chou Chun-ti, head of an environmental protection body grouping mothers.The EPA launched the first stage of a two-part ban in July 2002 when public catering facilities -- including canteens in government and state enterprises, military units, schools and public hospitals -- stopped using polystyrene and were banned from using plastic bags.The second stage was imposed in January 2003 on private restaurants and shops including department stores, supermarkets and fast-food outlets.EPA officials found that over the past year, private restaurants -- which consume at least half Taiwan's plastic bags -- had ignored the ban since the agency had too few staff to implement the policy thoroughly.""The EPA should figure out some solutions to solve the problems rather than dropping it when it has been half-way done,"" Chou said.The EPA said the overall policy had been a success because the amount of used plastic bags has been reduced to 19,000 tonnes each year, from 27,000 tonnes previously.Environmental activists have long complained that Taiwan is drowning in a sea of plastic, with more than 16 million bags a day handed out on the island.
The government of the western Indian state of Maharashtra on Wednesday bannedthe manufacture, sale and use of all plastic bags, saying they choked drainagesystems during recent monsoon rains.Environmental groups welcomed the ban, but said it wasn't enough. Plasticmanufacturers said 100,000 people would lose their jobs.Manufacturers and stores selling plastic bags will be fined 5,000 rupees(US$111; euro92), while individuals using bags face penalties of 1,000 rupees(US$22; euro18), said the state's top elected official, VilasraoDeshmukh.Deshmukh said the ban was prompted by the indiscriminate use of plastic bags,which blocked sewage and drainage systems during record monsoon rains in July.Flooding and landslides killed more than 1,000 people in thestate.The ban is to take effect Sept. 24. Until then, residents of the state can fileobjections and suggestions, Deshmukh said.Other Indian states have already banned the use of thin plastic bags _ 20microns or .002 centimeters thick _ used by shoppers.Last month, some prominent Bombay residents, including movie producers, sued thestate government for responding slowly to the crisis created by record rainslast month that paralyzed India's financial and entertainmentcapital.Residents blame haphazard planning, bad drainage and poor roads for the floodingand landslides.""The ban is long overdue and very welcome,"" said Debi Goenka, anenvironmentalist with the Bombay Environmental Action Group. Bombay is thecapital of Maharashtra state.""But to say the flooding was just because of plastic bags is stupid,"" Goenkasaid. ""This has to be a first step."" Environmental groups have demandedpreservation of open spaces and regular cleaning of drains andgarbage.Arvind Mehta, managing committee member of the All India Plastic ManufacturersAssociation, said more than 1,000 manufacturing plants would be forced to shutdown in the state, putting 100,000 people out of work.""The government is passing the buck. We are being made scapegoats,"" Mehta said.""The waste management system and people's littering habits should becorrected.""
A ban against bistros providing plasticbags free of charge will be lifted at the beginning of March, theEnvironmental Protection Administration (EPA) announced Monday.The EPA has recently amended its policy of restricting the use ofplastic bags and disposable dining utensils after evidence showed thepolicy has failed to cut short plastic consumption since itsimplementation July 1, 2001.According to official tallies, plastic bags used by bistros hasskyrocketed, surging from 5,793 tons per year before theimplementation of plastic restrictions to the current level of over10,000 tons, EPA officials said.Under the original policy, six different types of businesses andshops -- department stores and shopping centers, wholesale stores,supermarkets, chain convenience stores, chain fast food stores, andbistros and restaurants -- were banned from offering customersplastic bags thinner than 0.06 mm and from offering free plastic bagswith a thickness of over 0.06mm.Consumers were required to pay for plastic bags over 0.06mmthick, and the use of ""thick"" plastic bags led to the growth ofplastic consumption due to Taiwanese people's special dining customs,EPA officials said.For instance, it is common for people to contain and carry foodin plastic bags, which are mostly unrecyclable after carrying greasyfood.The amended policy therefore resumed the use of thin plastic bagsat bistros and restaurants as part of efforts to curb plasticconsumption. Other business stores are not subject to the ban'ssuspension.Meanwhile, encouraged by the fact that the amount of disposableplastic tableware used actually shrank 85 percent since the EPA beganputting into place plastic restrictions over three years ago, theadministration is scheduled to impose a ban on governmental agenciesand schools from using disposable tableware at dining places on July1. It is estimated that the new ban will contribute to a reducedconsumption of some 2,600 tons of plastic per year.The EPA proposed the amended policy Monday, which also rules aban against the use of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in the production ofall kinds of packing bags and cling films.PVC is described by Greenpeace International as a ""toxic plastic""because it produces toxic substances at every stage of itsmanufacture, consumption and dumping. Taiwan's PVC demand hasamounted to around 700,000 tons annually. From September, the ban onPVC use will be put into effect, according to the amended policy.
Changing people's mindset is the key to reducing the use of plastic bags, Hong Kong's Secretaryfor Environment, Transport and Works Sarah Liao said on Monday, adding Hong Kong's supermarkets will offer more incentives to urgecustomers use fewer plastic bags.Speaking on a talkshow of a local radio station, Liao said the proposed plastic bag tax was a complex issue which had to be examined carefully.On the plastic bags recovery trial, Liao noted dozens of housing estates and supermarkets had joined the scheme, which has cut the plastic bag use by 5 percent.The government is liaising with supermarkets on providing more incentives to customers to reduce plastic bag use, and a new promotion will be launched soon, she added.Liao stressed there was a need to introduce product responsibility schemes to lower the environmental risks, and the battery recycling scheme launched last week has shown manufacturers, importers, retailers and consumers are willing to share the responsibility.She said product responsibility schemes on tires and rechargeable batteries are being explored, while studies on drink containers and electrical appliances will be carried out this year.
A Bangladeshi national task force hasrecommended the law against the use of polythene shopping bags should be strictly enforced and measures should be taken to popularize jute bags.""Law enforcers should strictly and regularly block market entrance of polythene bags and nylon net bags being widely used recently,"" the task force was quoted by New Age as saying on Thursday.The task force formed in January recommended that a technology of making shopping bag of yarn, innovated by the Jute Research Institute, should be forwarded for commercial production, New Age reported.It stressed the need for widespread media campaign to make people aware of environmental hazards of polythene bags and motivate them to use safer alternatives.Polythene bag came into Bangladeshi market in 1982 and became more popular than other bags for its low price and easy portability. But they have been blamed for a number of environmental hazards including water contamination, clogging of drains and sewerage lines in and around the cities and soil degradation across the country.Considering the rapid environmental degradation caused by polythene, civil societies launched a movement against it and finally the government declared a ban on the production, distribution and marketing of such shopping bags with effect from Jan. 1, 2002.But the banned polythene bags staged a comeback in different forms and types as no suitable, low cost and user-friendly alternatives can be promoted so far in wider scale. Nylon net bagshave also made their way recently.
The French Ecology Ministry launchedon Monday a program designed to reduce household rubbish by 15 percent over the next five years and by nearly a third by 2015.French Ecology Minister Nelly Olin urged the public to spurn supermarket plastic bags and to think about the increasing amount of plastic packages they are throwing out daily.According to the ecology ministry, each one in France now throws out, on the average, 360 kilo of trash a year and only 12 percent is recycled and 6 percent transformed into compost, far behind its neighbor countries like Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands, which all have household waste recycling systems.The program will cost 2.5 million euros, said the ministry.
Another supermarket chain, China Resources Vanguard, announced here Thursday to reduce distribution of plastic shopping bags.This is the third voluntary agreement signed after similar agreements with Wellcome and PARKnSHOP in February and March.China Resources Vanguard pledged to reduce plastic bag distribution at its retail outlets by at least 15 percent in one year.Hong Kong Permanent Secretary for Environment, Transport & Works Keith Kwok said the government is pleased to see the three major supermarket chains are committed to reducing plastic bags byabout 90 million in a year.""We are also encouraging other supermarkets and major retail chains to join the voluntary scheme,"" Kwok said.The active involvement of supermarket chains will help change consumer behavior over time, he said, adding a large number of plastic shopping bags are disposed of at landfills each day. The implementation of voluntary agreements will reduce this kind of waste at the source.In the longer term, the government plans to prohibit free distribution of plastic bags and impose a levy to deter their use through legislation. It will consult the trade and the public before taking it forward, Kwok said.
",In late 2004 Hong Kong proposed that supermarkets provide incentives to customers to use fewer plastic bags and by early 2006 was considering prohibiting free distribution. During 2005 Japan drafted a plan to ban free distribution and the Indian state of Maharashtra banned sale or use of the bags with the support of environmentalists and cooperation of the plastic industry. Bangladesh called for stricter enforcement of its restrictions and launched a campaign to popularizing use of jute bags. France began a drive urging the public not to throw out so much plastic trash. ,"Hong Kong proposed a plastic bag tax. Supermarkets will offer customer incentives to lessen use. Japan proposes to stop retailers from giving out free plastic bags. Bangladesh bans production, distribution and marketing of polythene shopping bags and recommends strict enforcement of the law. India's state of Maharashtra banned manufacture, sale and use of plastic bags. The plastics manufacturing industry objects. France urged the public to spurn supermarket plastic bags. Taiwan banned businesses from giving free plastic bags but lifted the ban from bistros, which ignored it. China encourages supermarkets to voluntarily reduce plastic bag distribution and plans to prohibit it. ","More nations are fighting the distribution and use of plastic bags. Techniques being used include campaigns to change peoples' habits and enlisting voluntary merchant participation. In nations where bans are not working, stricter enforcement is being urged, as is the expanded use of biodegradable and natural fiber bags. ","India's western state of Maharashtra has joined other Indian states in banning the manufacture, sale, and use of plastic bags. Taiwan originally banned most businesses from offering plastic bags, but in January lifted the ban to allow bistros and restaurants to provide bags free of charge, a move sharply criticized by conservationists. A third Hong Kong supermarket chain voluntarily agreed to reduce distribution of plastic bags. Japan was considering a ban on the free distribution of plastic bags. Kenya's largest supermarket has begun using new biodegradable plastic bags. The French Ecology Ministry urged the public not to use plastic bags. "
D0933,D0933-A,"Children of older fathers face an enhanced risk of developingschizophrenia when they grow older, according to research publishedon Friday.Doctors in Sweden and Britain spotted the statistical risk aftersifting through the medical records of 712,000 people born in Swedenbetween 1973 and 1980.They identified 639 people who had been hospitalised withschizophrenia at some point between 1989 and 2001. Only four of thesewere siblings.After taking into account the patients' socioeconomic background,family history of psychosis, early parental death and other factorsthat could affect the outcome, the researchers found a strongstatistical link between schizophrenics and the age of their father.More than 15 percent of cases may have been due to the fact that thepatient had a father who was aged over 30 years at birth, theybelieve.The risk of schizophrenia was statistically small but rose steadilythe greater the age of the father at birth.The authors say this statistical evidence adds to previous researchthat points to an inherited source for schizophrenia and thatmutations in sperm, which accumulate as a man gets older, contributeto the risk.Schizophrenia is a severe disease of the brain, characterised byhallucinations and delusions that give a distorted view of reality.It is not, as is popularly thought, a Jekyll-and-Hyde condition ofsplit personality.The study is published by BMJ Online First, of the British MedicalJournal (BMJ). Its lead author is Finn Rasmussen, an associateprofessor of epidemiology at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.The doctors say that their findings are important, given the trend indeveloped countries towards delaying parenthood.In the case of England and Wales, they note that the average age offathers at the birth of their child was 29.2 years in 1980. In 2002,this had risen to 32.1 years.If the model is correct, this increase in paternal age could have ledto an additional 720 cases of schizophrenia in 2002.Health-disease-schizophrenia-X%
Alarmed by the rising consumption of cannabis among French teenagers, the government on Wednesday launched a 10-million euro (13 million dollar) campaign to warn of the drug's harmful effects on physical and mental health.With more than one in five 18 year-old boys claiming to be regular users -- and more than half of all 17 year-olds having smoked cannabis at least once -- France has the highest consumption rate in Europe along with Britain and the Czech Republic, according to official figures.The media campaign -- including a series of radio and television advertisements and the distribution of hundreds of thousands of leaflets -- is to ""set the myth of cannabis against the reality in order to debunk notions about its alleged harmlessness,"" the ministry said.Nearly 250 consultation centres are also to be established across the country, and a telephone hotline set up to advise those tempted by the drug. From the start of the next academic year, the campaign will be extended inside secondary schools. According to the French Observatory on Drugs and Addiction (OFDT), there are 850,000 regular consumers of cannabis in the country -- of whom 450,000 smoke cannabis every day. The number of 17 year-olds who have experimented with it has doubled in ten years, the OFDT calcalates.Toxicologists have established that the cannabis widely consumed today is far stronger than the drug that became current in university campuses in the 1960s and 70s, and warn that the psychological damage is greatly underestimated.Among the harmful effects to be highlighted in the campaign are memory loss, concentration lapses, altered perception and alienation from friends and family. ""There is a syndrome of demotivation which results in a lack of interest in school work and a gradual desocialisation. At the same time we now have proof of the link between cannabis abuse and certain acute or chronic psychotic conditions,"" said Dr Michel Reynaud, author of Cannabis and Health.Recent studies have established that cannabis can be a contributory cause in triggering schizophrenia.Concern over cannabis use has grown in recent years after a series of fatal road accidents in which it was shown that the drug was a cause. In 2003 a law was passed that makes driving under the influence of cannabis a criminal offence, and urine tests are being extended.""Cannabis has been shown to be responsible for 20 percent of accidents caused by people under 30 years of age,"" said Patrick Mura, president of the French Society for Analytical Toxicology.The government is also alarmed by the power of the drug economy in the country's high-immigration city suburbs, to where much the cannabis is initially smuggled from Morocco.
Australian researchers announced a breakthrough Thursday in the search for the cause of schizophrenia, linking the impaired thought processes involved with the disorder to thinning grey matter in the brain.Vaughan Carr of the Neuroscience Institute of Schizophrenia and Allied Disorders said the discovery could provide a better understanding of the genetic causes of the illness and eventually lead to improved treatments.""The importance of this research is that it links together for the first time abnormal brain structure and function in the one image and ties that with abnormal thinking in schizophrenia,"" Carr said.""Now this is a remarkable achievement.""The researchers used advanced computing technology to give them a ""new window"" into the brains of schizophrenia sufferers, Carr said.They examined the thickness and function of the brain in 10 Australian patients with early onset schizophrenia while they performed a planning task involving attention and memory in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. They compared the results with a healthy control group and found those with schizophrenia had difficulty completing the task.The computer analysis showed impaired thought processes and inability to problem solve among those with the debilitating mental illness were directly related to the thinning outer layer of grey matter and reduced activity of the affected part of the brain. Carr said the find, to be published in the international journal Neuroimage, would open new areas of research examining post-mortem tissue samples of the affected grey matter in schizophrenia sufferers. ""It means we can now focus on the genetics of a very specific area of the brain and delve deeper and deeper into why the tissue located there deteriorates in schizophrenia sufferers,"" he said.Researchers hope to pinpoint genes that may be turned on or off in schizophrenia sufferers, leading to possible new treatments.The mental disorder, which usually strikes people aged between 15 to 25, alters the way the brain functions and causes symptoms including hallucinations, hearing voices, delusions and impaired thinking. The research was done in collaboration with scientists in the United States and Germany.
Researchers in Iceland have discovered a region in the human genomethat, among Europeans, appears to promote fertility, and maybe longevityas well.Though the region, a stretch of DNA on the 17th chromosome,occurs in people of all countries, it is much morecommon in Europeans, as if its effect is set offby something in the European environment. A further unusual propertyis that the genetic region has a much more ancientlineage than most human genes, and the researchers suggest, asone possible explanation, that it could have entered the humangenome through interbreeding with one of the archaic human lineagesthat developed in parallel with that of modern humans.The genetic region was discovered by scientists at DeCode Genetics, abiotechnology company in Reykjavik, Iceland, which has made the Icelandicpopulation, with its comprehensive genealogy and medical records, a primehunting ground for the genetic roots of common diseases. Theirfinding is published in Monday's issue of Nature Genetics ina report by Kari Stefansson, Augustine Kong, Hreinn Stefansson andother DeCode scientists.The report seems likely to receive considerable attention, even though itraises as many questions as it answers. ""I thought itwas one of the most interesting papers in population geneticsI have ever read,"" said Nick Patterson, a mathematician atthe Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass., who advised DeCode onthe article but has no other connection with the company.The DNA region came to light during the search for aschizophrenia-causing gene, which turned out not to be there. Butthe DeCode researchers noticed that the DNA sequences they hadexamined did not seem to agree with those in thestandard human genome sequence, said Kari Stefansson, DeCode's chief executive.The lack of agreement turned out to be caused by thefact that the region exists in two forms in theIcelandic population. The region is not a single gene buta vast section of DNA, some 900,000 units in length,situated in the 17th of the 23 pairs of humanchromosomes. In some Icelanders, the DeCode team found, the sectionruns in the standard direction, but in others it isflipped. Looking for any physical consequence, the DeCode researchers foundthat women carrying the inverted section tended to have slightlymore children.The section carries several known genes, not one of which hasany obvious connection with fertility. It is not clear whyinverting the section should have any effect on the numberof children, Stefansson said. But the inversion does increase therate of recombination, the shuffling of genes between generations thatis a major source of genetic novelty. That could accountfor some of the increase in fertility.The DeCode scientists found that the chromosome-17 inversion is rare inAfricans and almost absent in Asians, but is present in20 percent of Europeans, the same frequency as in Iceland.The inversion seems to have been favored by natural selectionamong Europeans in fairly recent times, perhaps the past 10,000years. ""Maybe something switched it on in the European environment,such as an interaction with diet,"" said David Reich, apopulation geneticist at the Broad Institute.(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)Fertility is without doubt affected by different genes in different populations,and DeCode found a genetic element special to Europeans becausethat is where it was looking. The increased frequency ofthe inversion in Europeans is one of a growing numberof examples of recent human evolution.The inversion itself, however, is surprisingly ancient. Its age is revealedby its counterpart, the standard or noninverted section of chromosome17. The standard and inverted regions cannot exchange genetic elementsduring recombination because their DNA sequences do not match. Hence,unlike most of the rest of the genome, which getsshuffled in each generation, the two forms have existed separatelysince their creation. This event presumably happened when the regioncame adrift from its parent chromosome and got knitted backin the opposite way.When all the known versions of a human gene are compared,in most cases they turn out to have had asingle common ancestor about a million years ago. But thestandard and flipped versions of the chromosome 17 region lastshared a common ancestor 3 million years ago. It ishighly unusual for two versions of a gene to endurefor so long, because one will usually get lost bya natural process of elimination.The DeCode researchers propose two explanations. One is that the standardand flipped versions confer different advantages, so that it isbeneficial for a person to have inherited a copy ofeach from different parents. This balancing selection can keep twoversions of a gene around in a population indefinitely.DeCode's alternative proposal is that the flipped version was carried formany years in a different human lineage, one of thearchaic populations that preceded the emergence of anatomically modern humansin Africa 150,000 years ago. Then, in some episode ofinterbreeding, a single copy of the flipped version entered themodern human lineage some time before humans left Africa 60,000years ago.In support of this view, the flipped version carries far fewermutations than does the standard version, as if it hadbeen accumulating them from a much more recent date. Therehave been other recent hints of modern human interaction witharchaic hominids, notably the finding in October that a lineageof body lice seems to have been inherited from adifferent human species.(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)Stefansson said that another property of the inversion, though one notdescribed in Monday's article, was that it is associated withlongevity. DeCode scientists have located two sites on Icelanders' genomeswhere there is some genetic variant that promotes longer lifespan.The chromosome 17 inversion, it turns out, lies at oneof these sites. It occurs at much higher frequency inwomen over 95 and in men over 90 than inthe normal population. ""It seems to confer on people theability to live to extreme old age,"" Stefansson said.It is particularly surprising that the same genetic element should promotefertility and longevity, because most organisms are obliged to followa strategy either of breeding fast during short lives orof living longer and having fewer children. ""Usually people thinkof there being a tradeoff between fertility and longevity. Sowe are getting a free lunch here,"" said Dr. AlanRogers, a population geneticist at the University of Utah.Stefansson said his findings were empirical observations for which functional explanationshave yet to emerge. Despite the loose ends, other researchersseem impressed with the solidity of DeCode's findings. ""It's astartling and amazing claim, and it's actually pretty convincing andcompelling evidence at the same time,"" Reich said.
At 76, Dr. James Watson hasbeen recognized repeatedly for his brilliance and his life-altering discovery50 years ago, along with a colleague, of the structureof DNA.Remember that winding double-staircase known as the double helix that's recognizedworldwide as DNA's model?That was his discovery.And that finding at age 25 led him to become aNobel Prize winner.This day, when we meet, he is being honored by theNational Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression at aPalm Beach dinner. He sits with members of NARSAD --the president has a daughter with schizophrenia -- and webegin talking about his research into devastating mental illness andhis quest to find the genes that produce these disorders.He has already found genes implicated in attention deficit disorder andTourette's syndrome in children with autism.And we begin to talk about diagnostic testing -- when thesegenes are isolated. He thinks it's possible we could soonhave a test, like that done for Down syndrome, forschizophrenia. Parents could find out when the child is stillin utero if it was afflicted.(The same test, known as a DNA biopsy, might also beused in adults and children with schizophrenia to find genesthat are damaged and then select the best therapy forthem, similar to the way Herceptin is used in breastcancer and Gleevec is used for leukemia.)""We just have to spend the money ... if you wereat war, you'd work 24 hours a day, seven daysa week, but that's not the way science is done,""he says. ""We don't have the money. We have nogrants in support of this.""He rambles on about famous families who have genetic defects --bipolar, dyslexia, for example. And how fortunate it would beif they donated money to his research.""If you found the gene that caused it, you could finallyrid this curse from the family,"" he says.I ask him why he has chosen to concentrate now onschizophrenia.""We have a son who's been hospitalized with it,"" he answers.There is a shocked silence. No one knew.His son, now 35, hasn't responded to medication, he says.I ask him about what seems the cosmic injustice: A manwhose genius makes it possible for him to search outgenetic causes for disorders to be a father to sucha son.""I just look at it as DNA can't be copied perfectly,and this has always been true, and it leads toa lot of inequality.""A speech given a few years ago enhances his views.""Random throws of the genetic dice during the formation of spermand egg take away from too many infants the opportunityto participate in a meaningful life. Those unfortunate individuals geneticallyprogrammed ... represent unambiguous tragedies lacking in any compensatory sideadvantages. Common sense tells me that no one is seriouslyharmed by steps taken to prevent the birth of suchchildren,"" he has said.So he, a Nobel Prize winner, hasn't been spared the painof dealing with what his own research may someday spareothers from suffering. And that drives him, hard, every day.Carolyn Susman writes for The Palm Beach Post. E-mail: carolyn--susman@pbpost.com
In Dr. Huda Y. Zoghbi's laboratory at the Baylor College ofMedicine in Houston, her research team has found the geneticroots of at least two crippling neurological diseases -- Rettsyndrome and spinocerebellar ataxias.Recently, she and her colleagues identified a gene that regulates thegrowth of tiny inner ear hair cells, essential elements ofhearing and balance in mammals.For her findings, Zoghbi, a 50-year-old pediatrician who was born inLebanon, has won major honors in the world of science,including her election to the National Academy of Sciences.""To me, women don't have to give up relationships to dedicatethemselves to science,"" Zoghbi said over coffee at the RegencyHotel in Manhattan on a recent Saturday. She is marriedwith two children. ""My life is two things: the peopleI love and my work. With a little bit oforganization, it can be done.""Q. You started out as a neurological pediatrician. Why quit theclinic for the research bench?A. I got into research for emotional reasons. In 1985 whenI was about to finish my neurology training, I waspregnant with my first child, Roula, who is now 20.It was very hard on me to be an expectantmother and meet parents whose children had neurodegenerative diseases. Itdevastated me to say, ""Well, your child has a geneticdisorder, and we can't do anything about it.""I was fortunate that around that time I ran into ProfessorArthur Beaudet, a genetics researcher, who said, ""I'll be happyto train you in molecular genetics."" So I started overbecause I wanted to find a way to solve someof these terrible diseases. At the beginning, I knew lessthan the technicians in his laboratory.Q. How did you come to study the neurodegenerative disease knownas Rett syndrome, which, I believe, strikes about 1 girlin 10,000?A. While I was still a resident, I met Ashley, a5-year-old. She couldn't communicate, was having seizures and balance problemsand was constantly wringing her hands. These are signs ofRett syndrome.Her parents said she had started life as a perfectly normalgirl and then at the age of 18 months, allof this became manifest. Knowing that Ashley started out asa healthy child, it was hard to get her offmy mind. A week later, another little girl was broughtto me with similar symptoms. This can't be that rare,I thought.So I went to medical records and found the charts offive more girls with symptoms that fit the diagnosis ofRett syndrome. If I could identify about seven patients, Iknew this was much more common than believed. Moreover, Iwas intrigued by Rett syndrome, intellectually. I wondered what goeson with the brain of a child who starts outnormally and then loses her communication and motor skills.Q. Have you unraveled the puzzle of Rett syndrome yet?A. Well, we've found the gene that, when mutated, causes Rettsyndrome. That's the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene. Six years ago,we were able to clone it.It turns out that this gene's mutations cause a lot morethan Rett syndrome. There are patients with it who getseizures and others who get autism. In rare cases, youeven have bipolar disease and mental retardation.A couple of patients with juvenile-onset schizophrenia also have this mutation.So we think that the gene that's mutated in Rettsyndrome is probably affecting many processes and neuronal activities.It's the same for another neurological disease we study in mylab, spinocerebellar ataxia Type 1, which is also inherited. That'seven rarer because only 1 in 100,000 people get it.Yet, by studying it, we've learned that what happens tomutant proteins in the cell is the same as whathappens to the proteins mutated in Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases.In all cases, the mutant proteins accumulate within neurons andare not cleared properly.So, if we can figure out how to deal with theproteins mutated in ataxia, similar approaches could be taken inParkinson's and Alzheimer's. By researching diseases that affect only afew people, we might solve others that affect many.Q. Why is it such a big breakthrough when you discovera gene that's associated with a specific disease?A. With Rett syndrome, it's helpful to the parents of thesekids. Some thought they'd done something wrong and that's whytheir child was sick. Once we had the gene, theycould see it was not their fault.In terms of research, finding the gene permitted us to makeanimal models of the disease. We can now engineer miceto carry this mutation. It is possible to finally studythe disease in the mouse, and to spare humans.Also, once you have the gene, drugs are a possibility.Q. The president of Harvard, Lawrence Summers, suggested that biological differencesmight explain why women had not advanced so much inthe world of science. What was your reaction?A. I was disappointed by how he phrased his comments. WhenI read them, I worried about how a female graduatestudent would feel. My biggest concern was that these wordsmight be taken by young female scientists to go, ""Oww,I might not make it."" And that really upset me.In my own case, I've succeeded, in part, because I hada very supportive husband -- William Zoghbi, who is aprofessor of cardiology at Baylor. We've been together since wewere medical students in Beirut. He's always respected my needto go late at night to do my experiments. Ialso had fantastic mentors, male and female.Dawna Armstrong, a Baylor pathologist, when my baby was 2 monthsold, she could see my guilt about being away fromthe baby and say, ""Huda, babies, they sleep all thetime when they are this age.""Q. Do you think there's such a thing as a femalestyle of doing science?A. I think females communicate quite a bit, and that's importantin a lab. Also, there are times when I followmy intuition. You think, ""I'm going to follow this, eventhough the data doesn't say I should."" I do wonderif that intuitive approach is more prevalent among women scientists.Lawrence Summers didn't talk about any of that.Q. What drew you to medicine in the first place?A. I grew up in an educated, cultured Beirut family. Mymother urged me to become a pediatrician. I started medicalschool at the American University of Beirut in 1975. Thatwas the year the civil war in Lebanon began.Bombs fell on the neighborhood of the university. My class wasso determined to study that we attended lectures in thebasement and we slept there at night because you couldn'tgo home. I found a corner of the ladies' roomwhere I lived for most of the semester.At the end of that year, my parents sent me andmy brothers to visit our sister, who was living inTexas. They were afraid for us. While we were inthe United States, the borders to Lebanon closed. There wasno returning. So Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tenn., atraditionally African-American institution, accepted me two months after their termbegan.But as kind as they were, there I was, 21, alonein a new country, always worried about people back home:150,000 people would die in the Lebanese civil war. SomehowI managed. That year shaped me.
Medical marijuana is now legal in 11 states, and bills tolegalize it are pending in at least seven more. Thedrug is also at the heart of a case beingconsidered by the U.S. Supreme Court.Yet there remains much confusion over whether marijuana in fact hasany significant medical effect.""People subjectively report benefits,"" said Dr. Joseph I. Sirven, an epilepsyspecialist and associate professor of neurology at the Mayo ClinicCollege of Medicine in Scottsdale, Ariz. ""There's a whole Internetliterature suggesting what a wonderful thing it is. But thereality is, we don't know.""In an editorial last year in the journal Neurology, Sirven saidthe best studies of marijuana's effects on humans so farhave shown little objective evidence of benefit in patients withepilepsy or multiple sclerosis. And a growing body of researchindicates that, at least in teenagers, heavy marijuana use overa period of years significantly increases the risk of developingpsychosis and schizophrenia.In the Supreme Court case, two California residents, Angel McClary Raichand Diane Monson, brought a suit against federal officials inOctober 2002 to defend their use of marijuana after sixof Monson's marijuana plants were seized and destroyed by theDrug Enforcement Administration.The federal government, which considers marijuana illegal under the Controlled SubstancesAct, asked the Supreme Court to overturn a Court ofAppeals ruling that supported the two women. Oral arguments wereheard just after Thanksgiving and a ruling could come anyday.Raich's physician, Dr. Frank Henry Lucido of Berkeley, Calif., asserted inan affidavit that Raich risked death if she was deniedthe marijuana to treat nausea, anorexia, severe chronic pain andother disorders brought on by a variety of illnesses, includingpost-traumatic stress disorder, asthma and an inoperable brain tumor. Ona Web site created on her behalf, www.angeljustice.org, Raich saysshe joined the lawsuit ""in order to save my life.""While little scientific evidence supports such a lifesaving role for marijuana,many studies have found modest benefits in patients' subjective measuresof pain, sleep, nausea, appetite, tremors and muscle spasms.""There's nothing better for nerve pain than marijuana,"" said Phillip Alden,41, a writer in Redwood City, Calif. Twice a month,he spends about $200 to buy a half ounce ofhigh-potency marijuana from one of San Francisco's medical marijuana buyers'clubs.He smokes it three or more times a day to treatpain from a back injury and to improve his appetiteand reduce nausea associated with AIDS and the antiviral drugshe takes for it. It has even checked the progressionof his peripheral neuropathy, he said.Two recent surveys published in Neurology have documented widespread use ofmarijuana among Canadian patients and a widespread belief in itsbenefits. The first survey, of 220 patients with multiple sclerosis,found that 36 percent had used marijuana to treat theirsymptoms and that 14 percent were using it at thetime of the survey.The second, of 136 patients attending the University of Alberta EpilepsyClinic, found that 21 percent had used marijuana in theprevious year. Just over two-thirds of the active users saidit decreased the severity of their seizures and slightly morethan half reported a decreased frequency of seizures.But the lead author of the epilepsy study said it provedonly that some patients believed in marijuana, not that itor its active ingredients, called cannabinoids, actually worked. ""There's notbeen a randomized, controlled trial demonstrating that marijuana or anycannabinoid is any more effective in controlled seizures than aplacebo,"" said Dr. Donald W. Gross, director of the Universityof Alberta's adult epilepsy program.Although doctors may now prescribe marijuana in Canada for certain disorders,including epilepsy, Gross said he had never done so. ""It'sterribly complicated from a physician's standpoint, and somewhat frustrating,"" hesaid. ""We have a product that has been legitimized withoutany evidence of efficacy.""A large body of research in test tubes and animals supportsthe view that cannabinoids have anticonvulsive properties. But while a2003 study of 657 patients with MS published in thejournal Lancet found significant improvements in subjective reports of musclespasms and pain, it found no improvement by objective measuresafter 15 weeks.A follow-up report on the same group of patients did showmodest benefit after 12 months, but the researchers said theresults should be interpreted cautiously because the study had beenintended to test only short-term benefits.Dr. David Baker, a professor at the Institute of Neurology inLondon, has found beneficial effects of cannabinoids in mice whohave an artificially induced type of multiple sclerosis. But, hesaid, ""Showing clinical benefit in humans has been an elusivebeast.""""At best there is a narrow therapeutic effect before the sideeffects become unacceptable for many people,"" he said. "" Whatis clear is that there have been no dramatic improvementsoverall.""Dr. Kenneth P. Mackie, a professor of anesthesiology at the Universityof Washington, has devoted 15 years to studying the brain'sresponse to cannabinoids through specialized brain receptors called CB1 andCB2.""There's a whole bunch of theoretical reasons suggesting there would bea benefit for marijuana on a variety of conditions relatingto pain and neuroinflammation,"" Mackie said. ""But the clinical studiesjust aren't there.""Far stronger evidence exists for a harmful effect of marijuana inteenagers who use it early and often. ""We know thatcannabis is a contributory cause of schizophrenia,"" said Dr. RobinM. Murray, a professor at the Institute of Psychiatry inLondon and the co-editor of a new book, ""Marijuana andMadness: Psychiatry and Neurobiology.""In a 2002 study published in the British medical journal BMJ,Murray reported that New Zealand teenagers who started smoking marijuanabefore age 15 and continued doing so on a dailybasis raised their risk of developing psychosis and schizophrenia fromabout 2 percent to as much as 10 percent.The study, he said, ruled out the possibility that the teenagerswho used marijuana were also those who were more likelyto develop schizophrenia, whether or not they used the drug.""You have to take a lot to go psychotic,"" Murray said.""But with five joints a day for five years, anamount that is increasingly common in Europe, you're seriously increasingyour risk of schizophrenia.""But he added, the risk dropped sharply as people aged, sothat most chronically ill people who used marijuana for medicalpurposes were unlikely to experience psychosis as a result.Research in the United States has been greatly hampered by legalrestrictions.In 1997, Dr. Donald Abrams, an oncologist and assistant director ofthe Positive Health Program at the University of California atSan Francisco, became the first doctor authorized by the NationalInstitute of Drug Abuse to receive marijuana to conduct researchto determine if it provided medical benefits.Now more than a dozen California researchers are studying it underthe auspices of the University of California's Center for MedicinalCannabis Research.""Cannabis has a 5,000-year history of medical use,"" Abrams said. Hesaid he had completed three studies in patients with HIVthat showed no negative effects on their immune systems oron the functioning of the protease inhibitor drugs they weretaking. He is now trying to show that marijuana hasa beneficial effect on immune functioning, he said.
Identical twins possess exactly the same set of genes. Yet asthey grow older, they may begin to display subtle differences.They may start to look different, develop different diseases or slideinto different personalities. Women who are identical twins may differin their fertility or in the age at which theyreach menopause.These discrepancies are usually attributed to ill-defined differences in environment.But a whole new level of explanation has been opened upby a genetic survey showing that identical twins, as theygrow older, differ increasingly in what is known as theirepigenome. The term refers to natural chemical modifications that occurin a person's genome shortly after conception and that acton a gene like a gas pedal or a brake,marking it for higher or lower activity.Identical twins have the same set of epigenetic marks on thegenome when they are born. But differences in the epigenomeemerge as the twins grow older and become greater thelonger they live apart, say a team of researchers ledby Dr. Manel Esteller of the Spanish National Cancer Centerin Madrid.Their report appears in Tuesday's issue of The Proceedings of theNational Academy of Sciences.""This is one of the most fascinating things I have read,""said Dr. Nancy Segal, a psychologist who studies twins atCalifornia State University at Fullerton and the author of ""Indivisibleby Two,"" a forthcoming book on twins. ""By giving usa handle on something specific it opens up many newavenues of inquiry as to why twins are different.""There are two possible explanations for Esteller's findings. One is simplythe well- known fact that epigenetic marks are lost aspeople get older. Because the marks are removed randomly, theywould be expected to occur differently in two members ofa twin pair.A second possible explanation is that personal experiences and elements inthe environment -- including toxic agents like tobacco smoke --feed back onto the genome by changing the pattern ofepigenetic marks.Esteller believes he is seeing both processes at work. The evidencefor the second process, he said, is that twins whoreported that they had lived apart the longest also hadthe greatest differences in their epigenome.""This is a way for the genome to be responsive tothe environment,"" he said, noting that it is easier forchemical marks on the genome to change than for thegenome itself to mutate.His study suggests that the epigenome may be involved in manydiseases that can affect identical twins differently, like schizophrenia, bipolardisorder and cancer. Although schizophrenia evidently has a genetic component,the epigenome may hold the clue to its nongenetic aspects.Differences between identical twins could also help pinpoint the epigenetic differencesthat contribute to cancer. ""We think that epigenetic changes arevery common in cancer,"" said Dr. Peter A. Jones, presidentof the American Association for Cancer Research and a professorat the University of Southern California.Jones said Esteller's finding ""is exceptionally interesting in that it underlinesthe importance of epigenetic changes in human development and disease.""Jones recently convened a workshop to discuss starting an international humanepigenome project. The proposal could rival the Human Genome Projectin complexity because the human genome is the same inevery cell of a person's body, while the epigenome isexpected to be different for each of the 250 orso human cell types.Among the most important components of the epigenome are small chemicalhandles known as methyl groups, which are added directly tothe chemical units of DNA.A wave of demethylation occurs in a sperm's genome shortly afteran egg is fertilized, followed by the extensive readdition ofmethyl groups in early embryonic development.These methyl groups, which generally inhibit the activity of the genesin which they occur, tend to be lost during aging.Esteller's team studied the total amount of methylation in thetwins' genomes, as well as another kind of epigenetic modification,the addition of acetyl groups to the histone proteins thatact as a scaffolding and as a control system forDNA.
About 1.47 million Ugandans are suffering from sever mental illness, local media said on Friday quoting a report dubbed ""Progress Report 2004-2005.""This figure also accounts for the two percent of the populationthat suffers from epilepsy, one percent suffer from schizophrenia and three percent maniac depression, according to the report.Uganda has a population of 26.8 million, according to the 2002 national population census.The report quotes World Health Organization statistics showing that mental illness accounts for about 12.3 percent of the global disease burden.""This will rise to 15 percent by the year 2020 by which time, depression will disable more than AIDS heart disorders, traffic accidents and wars combined. The impact, both social and economic,on the lives of mentally ill people, their families and communities is phenomenal,"" said the report which was carried out by an international non-governmental organization, Basic needs UK in Uganda (BUU).According to Dr. Margaret Mungerera, a senior psychiatrist at Butabika National Psychiatrist Hospital, the number of people withmental disorders is likely to be high because the BUU study did not cover the whole countryThe study covered the districts of Kampala, Masaka, Hoima Sembabule and Masindi. Uganda has a total of 56 districts.""Basing on what we see, the country might even be having a bigger number of psychiatric victims. Take example of poverty gibbering among the people, the northern Uganda war and the changed lifestyle, all these can cause mental disorders,"" said Dr.Mungerera.At least 115 mentally ill people in Kampala and Sembabule were cured of mental disorders and discharged during the study.The BUU study was started in 2002 to determine whether Uganda would be eligible to initiate a mental health and development program.
IBM said on Monday that it is teaming with a European institute in a research initiative to uncover the secrets of human cognitive intelligence.Scientists from IBM and the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) of Switzerland will work together over the next two years to create a detailed model of the circuitry in the neocortex -- the largest and most complex part of the human brain,IBM said.The scientists hope that by expanding the project, nicknamed the Blue Brain Project, to model other areas of the brain, they will eventually build an accurate, computer-based model of the entire brain.Using the digital model created with IBM's Blue Gene supercomputer, scientists will run computer-based simulations of the brain at the molecular level, shedding light on internal processes such as thought, perception and memory, IBM said.The scientists also hope to understand more about how and why certain microcircuits in the brain malfunction -- thought to be the cause of psychiatric disorders such as autism, schizophrenia and depression.""Modeling the brain at the cellular level is a massive undertaking because of the hundreds of thousands of parameters that need to be taken into account,"" said Henry Markram, the EPFL professor heading up the project.Under the initiative, IBM will install a Blue Gene supercomputer at EPFL, with a peak processing speed of at least 22.8 trillion floating-point operations per second (22.8 teraflops), making it one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world.Markram is the founder of EPFL's Brain and Mind Institute, where more than 10 years of research and wet-lab experiments have produced the world's most comprehensive set of empirical data on the micro-architecture of the neocortex.Researchers from IBM will use their experience in simulating complex biological systems to help turn this data into a working 3-dimensional model re-creating the high-speed electro-chemical interactions of the brain's interior.
","Swedish researchers discovered that children of older fathers face an enhanced risk of developing schizophrenia. The risk increases with the age of the father. Unfortunately, trends in developed countries are toward delaying parenthood. Several studies have found that, at least in teenagers, heavy cannabis use can be a contributory cause in triggering schizophrenia. Australian researchers have found a link between the impaired thought processes in schizophrenia and thinning grey matter in the brain. Schizophrenia evidently has a genetic component, but changes in the epigenome, natural chemical modifications of genes, after birth, may hold a clue to its non-genetic aspects. ","There are statistical studies and partial explanations of the cause of schizophrenia, but no complete theory. Children born of older fathers are at higher risk. No schizophrenia-causing gene has been identified, but a few victims display a gene-mutation associated with Rett syndrome. Heavy daily use of marijuana starting before age 15 causes increased risk, but the risk decreases with age. Australian researchers found thinning of the outer layer of grey matter in the brain of victims. Other studies suggest environmental and social factors or natural chemical changes in a person's genome. ","Research shows a strong link between schizophrenics and their fathers' age, demonstrating a hereditary factor exacerbated by sperm mutations that accumulate with age. Australian researchers linked the impaired thought process involved with schizophrenia to the thinning of grey matter in the brain. A growing body of research indicates that years of heavy marijuana (also known as cannabis) use significantly increases the risk of developing schizophrenia. The malfunction of certain microcircuits in the brain may cause schizophrenia. A study suggests that the epignome may hold a clue to schizophrenia's nongenetic aspects. ","The older the father, the greater children's risk of developing schizophrenia. Heavy marijuana use over years increases schizophrenia risk. Impaired thought processes in schizophrenics have been linked to a thinning outer layer of brain grey matter. The epigenome and a mutation of the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene each may be involved in schizophrenia. A detailed model of the brain's circuitry being developed in Switzerland, might help show why malfunctions that cause schizophrenia occur. DNA biopsy may allow testing for schizophrenia in utero and finding damaged genes in schizophrenics. A search of Iceland's comprehensive records failed to find a schizophrenia-causing gene. "
D0933,D0933-B,"How well you sleep could depend on who your parents were, researchers at Switzerland's Lausanne University reported on Thursday after identifying for the first time a ""normal sleep"" gene among mice.""The first lesson of our research is that the quality of sleep is genetically determined,"" Mehdi Tafti, a professor at the university's Centre for Integrative Genomics, told AFP.The scientists used an electroencephalograph to study low-frequency brain waves among mice.These so-called delta waves, the result of neuron activity, are telltales of the depth and quality of sleep.""We realised that some mice slept less well because they lacked delta activity,"" Tafti said.  ""When we compared their genes with those of other mice, we localised the gene responsible for this difference."" The finger points at a gene that encodes cell receptor for retinoic acid.Vitamin A, found in eggs, carrots and other orange or yellow vegetables, is known to act on this receptor.Scientists already knew that vitamin A plays an important role in the brain, in respect of sight but also diseases such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's -- diseases that are also accompanied by a lack of delta activity.Research on the mice found too much vitamin A was bad for sleep, although the scientists are unsure what the results of a deficiency of the vitamin would be and what the ideal intake is. Too much vitamin A can damage health, especially among pregnant women.In humans, delta activity diminishes with age, which is why children sleep deeply and awake refreshed, while old people usually sleep less well.The study appears on Friday in the US weekly journal Science.Previous research has identified genes that can cause sleeplessness, but this is the first to identify a gene linked with normal sleep.
A study of a famine in China more than 40 years ago found that children born toseverely malnourished women are more likely to develop schizophrenia.The research bolsters the evidence that environmental factors can trigger thedevastating mental illness.Compared with children born before or after the 1959-61 famine, those bornduring the disaster faced double the risk of becoming schizophrenic lateron.The results are nearly identical to a previous study of a famine in Hollandresulting from a Nazi food blockade toward the end of World WarII.""Since the two populations are ethnically and culturally distinct, the processesinvolved may apply in all populations undergoing famine,"" the authorssaid.Lead author Dr. David St. Clair of the University of Aberdeen, Scotland,conducted the study with researchers from China. Their findings appear inWednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.The study supports the theory that schizophrenia is caused by a geneticpredisposition influenced by environmental triggers that disturb the developingfetal brain _ in this case, nutritional deficiencies.And that raises the possibility that preventing starvation and malnutritioncould head off some cases, said Richard Neugebauer, a schizophrenia researcherat the New York State Psychiatric Institute who was not involved in thestudy.Neugebauer said in an accompanying editorial that the study's similarity to theearlier Dutch findings is remarkable given the differences in the twopopulations.Still, Neugebauer said, the new research leaves unanswered exactly hownutritional deficiencies disturb fetal brain development to the point ofincreasing the risk of schizophrenia.It also does not resolve whether deficiencies in all foods or in a singlenutrient increase the risk. That is ""the most pressing question from a publichealth and interventionist perspective,"" Neugebauer wrote.The answer would determine whether the findings apply globally or just todeveloping countries where overall malnutrition is common, hesaid.Schizophrenia is characterized by delusional thinking and difficulty in dealingwith others. It affects about 1 percent of the world population. Symptomsusually appear during the teens or early adulthood.Schizophrenia runs in families, and various infections _ including measles, fluand herpes _ are among environmental factors that some scientists believe mayincrease the risk when they affect pregnant women.The famine study focused on the Wuhu region of Anhui province in eastern China,one of the hardest-hit areas. The researchers examined data on births and deathsbefore, during and after the famine and on psychiatric records from 1971 to2001.In 1960, in the midst of the famine, there were 13,748 children born in theregion; 192 of them developed schizophrenia. That compared with 483schizophrenics out of 59,088 births in 1956 and 695 out of 83,536 births in1965.___On the Net:
Copy machines that talk. Co-workers conspiring to kill. These arethe kinds of bizarre hallucinations and delusions that have drivenpeople with schizophrenia from schools and workplaces and depositedthem on the lonely margins of society.Now, however, doctors are discovering that other well-known, butmuch less flamboyant, symptoms of the brain disorder may be just assignificant in preventing schizophrenics from engaging in the realworld. Mental confusion, apathy and the inability to experiencepleasure are now thought to be major barriers to a return tomainstream life.Such symptoms are hard to treat. Although a number of antipsychoticmedications can help blot out the so-called ``positive'' symptoms ofschizophrenia -- the disorienting and disturbing hallucinations anddelusions -- there are no medications to treat the cognitiveimpairment and emotional symptoms.In recent years, researchers have started seeking therapies forthese so-called ``negative'' symptoms of schizophrenia, says Dr.Stephen Marder, a professor of psychiatry at the Semel Institute forNeuroscience and Human Behavior at the University of California, LosAngeles and director of the mental health research, education andclinical center for the VA Greater Los Angeles Health Care System.The impetus has been the recovery movement, an effort by patients,their families and other mental health advocates that aims not to``cure'' the disease but to restore schizophrenics as functioningmembers of society.``The recovery movement is saying, `You can go just so far inimproving positive symptoms, but we also want to be able to socialize,to work and make progress in our lives,' '' says Marder, who hashelped spearhead a national research effort addressing the problem.``If that is going to happen, it's likely we're going to have todevelop drugs that address those areas.''The cognitive and emotional problems can be deeply crippling.People with schizophrenia ``seem like they have a lack of ability toexpress themselves,'' Marder says. ``They are also oftentimesapathetic. Some will say, `I would really like to do things, but Ican't get myself interested in doing it.' ''College students experiencing their first psychotic episode oftenfind they can no longer continue school even if promptly treated withantipsychotics and the hallucinations are resolved, he says. ``They'llfind their grades deteriorate. Reading and studying and focusing theirattention becomes so difficult.''The search for treatments for these problems represents a dramaticshift in drug development goals for schizophrenia. As recently as adecade ago, doctors and patients rejoiced in a new family ofantipsychotic medications aimed at reducing hallucinations anddelusions without many of the severe side effects linked to the olderantipsychotic drugs. Older drugs, such as Haldol, typically causetremors and muscle rigidity.But the new so-called atypical antipsychotics, though helpful tomany, haven't led to sweeping improvements in quality of life, expertsacknowledge. In an 18-month study released in September, researchersfound that three-quarters of the patients stopped taking theirassigned drugs before the trial's conclusion because the medicationsdidn't improve their condition enough or because of side effects suchas tremors or significant weight gain.Even with treatment, about 85 percent of schizophrenics areunemployed, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.``Ten years ago, there was a hope that the newer medications wouldgive us a greater chance at recovery, the vanishing of the disorder,''says Dr. Thomas R. Insel, director of NIMH. ``I think (the study)makes clear that the medications we currently have are necessary butnot sufficient.''Several drug companies are continuing to seek better antipsychoticdrugs. But the main focus of research within the government andacademia is on better understanding the negative symptoms of thedisease.For decades, scientists have blamed schizophrenic symptoms onabnormalities in the brain chemical dopamine -- and these are, indeed,linked to the delusions and hallucinations.But new research suggests other brain chemicals are involved in thedisorder, contributing to such symptoms as confusion and emotionalunresponsiveness.NIMH is collaborating with universities and industry to identifypossible new medications for cognitive deficits and develop betterinstruments for assessing improvements. Ideally, these new medicationswould give people with schizophrenia the ability to concentrate, carryout tasks and interact socially.One promising substance is a drug, D-cycloserine, that is used tocontrol tuberculosis. D-cycloserine works on a structure in the brainknown in shorthand as the NMDA receptor, which plays a key role inlearning and memory. It's believed that some of the symptoms ofschizophrenia are caused by a blockage or abnormality of thisreceptor; D-cycloserine appears to unblock it.Studies on D-cycloserine drugs for schizophrenia are still in earlystages. But one study, reported in March in the journal BiologicalPsychiatry, showed that 39 people with schizophrenia takingD-cycloserine in addition to a traditional antipsychotic experiencedimprovements in a range of symptoms, including hallucinations,delusions, apathy, withdrawal and cognitive deficits.Another avenue of study involves targeting a serotonin receptorthat is critical to cognitive function. Saegis Pharmaceuticals, acompany in Half Moon Bay, Calif., is teaming with Eli Lilly & Co. inphase 2 testing of a drug, SGS518, which blocks this receptor, withthe hope of improving cognitive functioning.Meanwhile, San Diego's Acadia Pharmaceuticals is studying achemical that may help subdue psychotic symptoms as well as improvecognition. The company is on track to present results from phase 2studies within a year, said chief executive officer Uli Hacksell.``There is a lot of excitement about the ability to improve thenegative symptoms in schizophrenia,'' Hacksell says. ``It's time to dosomething about this part of the symptomology of the disease thathasn't been dealt with so far.''Drugs, however, will take recovery only so far. Non-drug treatmentsare also important. For example, Insel says, a program calledsupportive employment -- in which employees receive job coaching,support, even transportation -- can boost employment rates from 10percent to 50 percent. Educating family members, and engaging them aspart of the treatment team, can also sharply reduce the relapse rate.``This whole push for recovery is very important, but I don't thinkmedications are going to be the largest part of that story,'' Inselsays. ``I think we have some very good (nonmedical) treatments thatare not used nearly enough. We need multiple forms of care, not justmedication.''
A teenage brain on pot looks frighteningly similar to the brains ofadolescents with schizophrenia, according to a new study.While it's too early to prove a connection, researchers at NorthShore University Hospital-Long Island Jewish Healthcare System cautionthat marijuana could be a match that ignites an underlying geneticvulnerability to schizophrenia.Scientists have long debated whether drug abuse triggersschizophrenia, which in males usually appears in late adolescence, orwhether the illness itself can lead to drug abuse.``It is the story of nature vs. nurture,'' said Manzar Ashtari, anassociate professor in radiology and psychiatry at Albert EinsteinCollege of Medicine and a scientist at LIJ's Zucker Hillside Hospital.``If there are people who are vulnerable and smoke marijuana, they maybe putting themselves at greater risk for developing severe mentalillness.''Robert L. Balster, an endowed professor of pharmacology andtoxicology at Virginia Commonwealth University, said that while moreresearch is needed, ``studies such as this are very important inproviding new leads for possible brain mechanisms that could beinvolved in drug abuse and its frequent association with mentalillness.''The studies at Zucker Hillside were done only in males becausefemales tend to develop schizophrenia later, in their mid-20s andbeyond. Ashtari suspects the developing brain in late adolescence isat greater risk of environmental damage.``Whatever insult is happening, it is taking place in brain regionsstill under construction,'' said Ashtari, who presented her findingsWednesday at the Radiological Society of North America's annualmeeting in Chicago.The scientists conducted several brain scan studies in teenagemarijuana smokers who used the drug daily for at least one year; inadolescent schizophrenia patients who didn't smoke marijuana; inschizophrenia patients who also use marijuana regularly, and inhealthy, nonsmoking controls.Ashtari and her co-investigator, child psychiatrist Dr. SanjivKumra, found that a brain region called the arcuate nucleus, a bundleof fibers that connects the front of the brain to deeper regions, isunderdeveloped in both schizophrenia patients and in marijuana users.While the lack of growth seems to be only on the left side in theseteenagers, schizophrenia patients who also abuse marijuana showedproblems on both sides of the brain.Ashtari said the arcuate nucleus is critical to higher cognitivefunctions.
SCHIZOPHRENIA INSIGHT FROM RATS A photo is being sent to NYTNSPhoto Service subscribers. Non-subscribers can make individual purchases by calling212-556-4204 or 888-603-1036.) Rats and mice and monkeys do notget schizophrenia.That is lucky for the animals but bad for the millionsof humans who suffer from it, often struggling with itsdelusions and mental damage from young adulthood until they die.With no animals to experiment on, researchers have been hamperedin their efforts to crack the question of what schizophreniadoes in the brain to produce such devastating symptoms.But they may be getting closer. Dr. Francine Benes of McLeanHospital has just published work showing that on the levelof cells and chemicals, some of the changes of schizophreniacan be replicated in a rat's brain.""This has never been done before, and conceptually, it's an importantstep forward,"" she said.The rats did not behave as if they were seeing hallucinationsor hearing voices - though who can tell? Rather, Benesused a drug to mimic some of the biological changesof schizophrenia, and recorded electrical activity in the brain showingthat, indeed, schizophrenia-like effects in certain circuits in the rat'sbrain had resulted.Her findings could lead to new targets for schizophrenia drugs, andalso could allow researchers to better pinpoint genes that areinvolved in the disease.""This is a pioneering study that reproduces the neuropathology of schizophreniain rodents,"" said Dr. Alessandro Guidotti, a schizophrenia researcher andscientific director of the Psychiatric Insitute of the University ofIllinois at Chicago.It is only a partial model, he cautioned, so ""this hasto be taken with a grain of salt."" But itcould provide a way to test schizophrenia drugs on animalsfor potential use in humans, he said, and the lackof such animal models up until now has been amajor obstacle to the development of better drugs. Research onthe basic biology of disease often can only be donein animals, because test animals are killed, dissected, or subjectedto other procedures that would be unethical in humans.Published this month in the Proceedings of the National Academy ofSciences, Benes's findings in rats build on two decades ofresearch, by her and others, beginning with an analysis ofbrain tissue from dead schizophrenics and now including high-tech brainimaging and genetic analysis.It was back in the 1980s, Benes recalled, that researchers beganto suspect that levels of a chemical messenger in thebrain called GABA were abnormal in people with schizophrenia. GABAis the main such messenger that inhibits, or dampens, thefiring of neurons in the brain.Benes gradually realized that there were two particular areas of thebrain where the GABA abnormalities showed up repeatedly: one area,in the cortex or rind of the brain, played arole in attention and emotion at the conscious level. Theother was in the hippocampus, which is central to memory.It could be, she reasoned, that both of these areas werepart of a network that is mis-wired in schizophrenia, andthe source of these abnormalities was elsewhere. And yes, itturned out that major highways of nerve connections linked boththese spots with the amygdala, a small almond-shaped structure deepin the brain that is important for emotion and learning.""So then we thought we had the makings of a ratmodel,"" she said. ""We ought to be able to experimentallymanipulate the amygdala and produce changes in one of thesedownstream sites that are similar to what we see inschizophrenia.""With a drug called picrotoxin, Benes dampened the GABA system inthe amygdala. Two hours later, when her team examined GABA-releasingcells in the rat's hippocampus, they could see changes similarto those in schizophrenia. They also used electrodes to measurethe activity in neurons in the affected areas, and foundGABA levels dramatically reduced.Such work, she said, is allowing her team now to dissectout the individual neurons that are likely most important inschizophrenia and figure out which among thousands of genes maybe most important in the disease.""We're inside the brain, we're inside the circuit, now we're insidethe cells, and I really believe this is the trailthat we have to follow,"" she said.Carey Goldberg is reachable at goldbergglobe.com.
Dr. Frederic Quitkin, a psychiatrist whose research helped establish that certainkinds of depression could best be treated with medications andthat schizophrenia was related to neurological impairments rather than problemsof childhood, died on Oct. 9 in New York. Hewas 68.The cause was pancreatic cancer, said his son, Dr. Matt Quitkinof Washington.Quitkin, a Manhattan resident, was the founding director of the DepressionEvaluation Service at the New York State Psychiatric Institute anda professor of clinical psychiatry at the Columbia University Collegeof Physicians and Surgeons.""He developed the concept of an atypical depression that is quitechronic, where people tend to overeat and oversleep and respondvery specifically to a group of medications that aren't usedthat much,"" said Dr. Donald Klein, director of research atthe New York State Psychiatric Institute and a colleague atColumbia.Many people with depression respond to selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, likeProzac and Zoloft, or a class of drugs known astricyclics. Quitkin's research helped establish that atypical depression could bemore effectively treated with a class of drugs known asMAO inhibitors, Klein said.In addition to his work on atypical depression and schizophrenia, Quitkinresearched other psychiatric disorders, including those associated with drug andalcohol dependence, and on treatment with a placebo.Frederic Quitkin was born in New York City. He received hisundergraduate degree from Princeton and his medical degree and adoctorate of medical science from the State University of NewYork Downstate Medical Center.In addition to his son, he is survived by two daughters,Megan and Rachel, both of New York; and two grandsons.
Researchers are offering new ammunition to worried parents trying to dissuadetheir teens from smoking marijuana: Evidence is mounting that forsome adolescents whose genes put them at added risk, heavypot use could increase the chances of developing severe mentalillness - psychosis or schizophrenia.This week, the pot-psychosis link gained ground when two major medicaljournals reviewed the research to date and concluded that itwas persuasive. In PLOS Medicine, an Australian public health policyexpert wrote that genetically vulnerable teens who smoke marijuana morethan once a week ""appear at greater risk of psychosis,""while the British medical journal BMJ cited estimates that marijuanause could contribute to about 10 percent of cases ofpsychosis.The new research has little hint of ""Reefer Madness"" alarmism. Rather,a half-dozen long, careful studies published in the last severalyears have tried to determine whether pot-smoking is a causerather than an effect of mental illness. And groundbreaking researchhas begun to try to pinpoint which genes and brainchemicals could do the damage.The conclusions remain controversial, in part because it would be unethicalto randomly assign teens to smoke or not smoke pot- which would be necessary to perform a gold-standard studyto definitively show that adolescent marijuana use causes mental illness.It could be the other way around, or some otherfactor could put teens at risk of both.But the recent research has attempted to get around these hurdlesby controlling for factors such as the presence of psychosisbefore the use of marijuana, family income, education, other druguse, and childhood traumas.""No single study is perfect,"" Wayne Hall, author of the PLOSMedicine essay and a professor at the University of Queensland,said in an e-mail interview. ""But the fact that somany individually imperfect studies so consistently find this relationship addsconfidence to the conclusion that the relationship is causal.""The recent research points to adolescence as a particularly risky timeto smoke marijuana heavily for those genetically predisposed to mentalillness. Brain scientists theorize that marijuana may induce temporary changesin brain chemistry that, when reinforced over time, become permanent.Among the research cited by both papers appearing this week wasan intriguing study published last year that followed a groupof more than 800 New Zealanders from birth until age26. The study looked at people with a gene variantthat apparently predisposes them to developing psychosis, and people withoutit. The variant was carried by 25 percent of thestudy's participants.The study found that among those with this variant, smoking marijuanaas teens increased their risk of psychosis in young adulthoodnearly tenfold compared with those who did not smoke asteens. Those who smoked pot but did not have thegene variant incurred little or no added risk.No test of such gene variants is widely available. Dr. RobinMurray, a psychiatry professor at Kings College London and anauthor of the New Zealand paper, said he and otherresearchers like to joke that they should set up aDNA-test tent at rock concerts and tell customers whether itis safe to get stoned. In reality, however, the generesearch is at too early and tentative a stage tojustify offering a test, he said.Other studies cited in the BMJ article found that teens andyoung adults who smoked marijuana had roughly double the riskof later developing psychotic symptoms, but these studies did notdistinguish between carriers and noncarriers of the gene variant.Still, even among pot smokers, the absolute risk of developing schizophreniawas low, Murray said - about 2 percent. And theadded risk from smoking pot was small compared to, say,cigarette smoking, which multiplies a person's chances of lung cancerby 15, he noted.Overall, schizophrenia affects about one in every 100 people, and twomore in every 100 experience a lesser form of psychosis.This week's PLOS Medicine essay suggests that teens should be consideredvulnerable if they have psychosis in the family, an indicationtheir genes may predispose them to it, or have had""unusual psychological experiences after using cannabis.""In recent months, the White House has emphasized a causal linkbetween marijuana and schizophrenia as part of an antipot campaign,but the National Institute on Drug Abuse does not listpsychosis as a marijuana risk on its informational website.The evidence for a link is becoming more convincing, said Dr.Wilson Compton, who directs the institute's public health research program.But he said the agency wants ""to make sure wedon't overblow"" the risk, because that would make teenagers likelierto discount the warnings.The controversy stems in part from the challenges of the research.Consider a boy who has shown early signs of schizophreniasince childhood, lacking friends and seeking isolation. In his earlyteens, he starts hanging out with pot-smokers, gets increasingly withdrawnand is finally diagnosed with schizophrenia at 19.In a case like that, it is likely that the earlysymptoms of the disease led to the pot-smoking rather thanvice versa, said Dr. Harrison Pope, director of the BiologicalPsychiatry Laboratory at Harvard's McLean Hospital.""I'm not saying the studies are wrong,"" he said. ""I'm sayingthis is a caveat you have to bear in mindeven when you see six studies all in agreement -it's very, very difficult in retrospect to tease apart thechain of causality.""But even marijuana advocates allow that there could be a link,at least for a small minority of pot smokers.Marijuana has an excellent safety record when used in moderation byadults, emphasized Paul Armentano, senior policy analyst for the NationalOrganization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. But ""I wouldnot rule out that heavy use of marijuana at ayoung age, particularly combined with other drugs, could precede onsetof some symptoms of mental illness.""The New Zealand study, published last year in the journal BiologicalPsychiatry, looked at a gene called COMT, which is involvedin the breakdown of dopamine, a brain chemical known toplay a role in psychosis.Though the researchers found a dramatically higher risk when teenagers withthe wrong variant of the gene regularly smoked marijuana, theycautioned that even so, that combination accounted for only one-fifthof the people in the study who became psychotic.Still, the COMT study has brought excitement among psychiatric researchers, becauseit highlights so elegantly how a single gene could interactwith an environmental factor to contribute to mental illness. Nowthe challenge is translating the research into a credible warningfor teenagers.""People who smoke pot don't [automatically] go on to become schizophrenic- boom boom boom,"" said Alan Budney, a professor andfederally funded addiction researcher at the University of Arkansas forMedical Sciences. ""There's an intricate level of risk factors thatdon't apply to Tom, Dick, and Harry - it justapplies to, say, Jim.""At least, said Murray of London, he now has better answersfor schizophrenic patients who ask, ""Why is it you're tellingme that cannabis contributed to my going psychotic when allmy mates smoked more than me and nothing ever happenedto them?""Carey Goldberg is reachable at goldbergglobe.com
INSULIN A SUSPECT IN ALZHEIMER'S, SCHIZOPHRENIA A graphic is being sentto NYTNS Photo Service subscribers. Non-subscribers can make individual purchasesby calling 800-535-4425. A small but growing chorus of scientistsis becoming convinced that insulin is just as important tothe brain as it is to the body.The body needs insulin to convert sugar in the bloodstream toenergy. People whose bodies either don't make enough insulin ordon't process it correctly develop Type 1 or Type 2diabetes, which can lead to poor circulation, kidney failure, blindness,and death.The role of insulin in the brain is less clear, butthis much is certain: When brain cells are deprived ofinsulin, they die. Now researchers are discovering that a breakdownin insulin-processing in the brain plays a role in mentalillnesses. Perhaps even a driving role.Dr. Suzanne de la Monte, a neuropathologist at Rhode Island Hospitalin Providence, believes that Alzheimer's disease could be called ""Type3 diabetes."" And C. Anthony Altar, president of Maryland-based PsychiatricGenomics, refers to schizophrenia as ""diabetes of the brain.""Though researchers are still answering basic questions about insulin's role inmental illness, the potential impact of their work is dramatic.Until now, research on the ravages of Alzheimer's has centeredmainly on the amyloid plaques that build up in thebrain as the disease progresses, while scientists have focused ona breakdown in brain cell communication to explain schizophrenia, inwhich victims often become delusional and erratic as brain tissuedies.If the insulin researchers are right, those problems could be secondaryto a more fundamental breakdown in the way brain cellsprocess insulin to generate energy and protect themselves against death.Whether an insulin shortage ""causes the disease, contributes to the disease,or it's the brain's response to injury we don't knowyet,"" said Dr. Jesse Roth, geriatrician-in-chief of the North ShoreLong Island Jewish Health System, who has studied insulin's rolein the brain since the 1980s.Doctors who treat Type 2 diabetes are already concerned about whethertheir patients are at greater risk of developing diseases ofthe brain later in life. Studies have shown that diabeticpatients are at greater risk of Alzheimer's, but researchers haveassumed that diabetes is just one of several risk factors.Likewise, people with schizophrenia are at least twice as likelyto develop Type 2 diabetes, but until now, scientists haveattributed that to the unhealthy lifestyle of schizophrenics as wellas the medications they take.""We need to do the basic science, because we need tobe sure,"" said Dr. C. Ronald Kahn, president of theJoslin Diabetes Center, who is concerned that the current Type2 diabetes epidemic could foreshadow an explosion of mental illness.Kahn's research also suggests that insulin problems in the brain, inturn, may make people more vulnerable to Type 2 diabetes.Lab mice genetically modified to block insulin processing in thebrain became obese and showed signs of diabetic insulin resistance.""If this is correct, the public health implications are huge,""he said.Ironically, some doctors had latched onto insulin as a possible treatmentfor mental illness in the mid-20th century, when ""insulin shocktherapy"" became popular as a last-ditch treatment for schizophrenia. Thetreatment pumped patients so full of the hormone that theywould go into a diabetic coma.While some schizophrenics, such as John F. Nash Jr., the mathemeticianportrayed in the movie ""A Beautiful Mind,"" showed improvement fromthe shock treatment, up to 10 percent of the patientsdied, and by the early 1960s, insulin therapy had goneonto the scrapheap of medical history.When Roth began his research for the National Institute of Health25 years ago, most neurologists agreed that insulin played anegligible role in brain chemistry. Insulin levels in the brainwere low compared with levels in the rest of thebody, and the brain seemed to have limited need forthe hormone.But Roth's team at NIH demonstrated that brain cells possess insulinreceptors to grab the hormone as it floated by andtook pictures of insulin binding to receptors in rats' brains.They argued that insulin plays a complex role in braincells, from cell repair to self-defense. Far from being abit player in the brain, Roth suggested that insulin ""hasa very rich job description.""When de la Monte started her insulin research in the early1990s, the neuropathologist was amazed that few scientists had builton Roth's work. She used a chemical treatment to drasticallyreduce insulin levels in the brains of rats and foundthat they developed Alzheimer's symptoms, including large-scale cell death. Immediately,she said, ""I knew we had to stop everything we'redoing and focus on Alzheimer's.""In recent years, De la Monte's lab has shown that thebrain actually produces insulin itself rather than relying on insulinfrom the pancreas that circulates in the rest of thebody. Last year, in a study of brain samples from45 Alzheimer's patients, de la Monte found that the numberof insulin receptors in the frontal cortex, the center ofintellect, drops by 80 percent in advanced cases of thedisease, meaning that the cells don't get the insulin theyneed to survive.""Insulin disappears early and dramatically in Alzheimer's disease,"" said de laMonte, who also teaches pathology at Brown University Medical School.""Many of the unexplained features of Alzheimer's, such as celldeath and tangles in the brain, appear to be linkedto abnormalities in insulin signaling.""Of course, other Alzheimer's researchers say it's too soon to saythat insulin defects are the most important cause of thedisease. Large-scale studies have also shown that high blood pressure,obesity, and cardiovascular disease put people at higher risk ofAlzheimer's.""It is a real stretch to call Alzheimer's disease Type 3diabetes,"" said Dr. Hugh C. Hendrie, co-director of the Centerfor Alzheimer's Disease and Related Neuropsychiatric Disorders at Indiana University.He believes the disease probably has more than one cause.The connection between insulin defects and schizophrenia is even less wellestablished. About three years ago, researchers at Psychiatric Genomics detecteda strange pattern in the brains of deceased schizophrenia patients.In the hippocampus, the brain region responsible for memory andlearning, they found low levels of activity in genes thatgovern the breakdown of sugars and energy production, suggesting aninsulin-processing problemLast year the researchers discovered that the same 14 genes thatare missing in the brains of schizophrenics are also missingin muscle tissue of diabetics. What's more, they were ableto boost production of the deficient genes in the labby adding insulin or insulin-like growth factor, a protein thatis similar to insulin.""We were quite stunned,"" said Altar of Psychiatric Genomics, which isnow focusing on potential treatments for schizophrenia that would increasethe activity levels of the genes. ""There's a whole seriesof steps that may prevent the schizophrenic brain from respondingto insulin.""Of course, Altar's insulin theory remains new and largely untested, soeven those who hope he is right, such as theStanley Medical Research Institute, which is funding him, are cautious.But Roth of the Jewish Medical Center said, ""Whether he'sright in detail I don't know, but he's right inprinciple.""So far, very few insulin-based treatments for diseases of the brainhave reached human trials. However, physicians from the Veterans AffairsPuget Sound Health Care System and the University of Washingtonare about to study whether insulin delivered in a nasalspray can improve the memory of people with early-stage Alzheimer'sdisease.But de la Monte is nvinced that one day, insulin therapiescould help the nation's 4 million Alzheimer's patients, and maybeeven Parkinson's disease patients, too. ""It opens the door tomany other approaches to a disease that we don't reallyhave any therapies for,"" she said.Scott Allen can be reached at allenglobe.com.
EXPLORING MENTAL ILLNESS AND BATTLING HER OWN (Science Times) Barron H.Lerner teaches medicine and public health at Columbia University. LucyFreeman, who died at the end of 2004, thought thatthere was nothing wrong with being crazy.As a reporter for The New York Times in the 1940sand '50s, she worked to remove the stigma of mentalillness, even writing a revealing book that chronicled her ownpsychoanalysis.Freeman's efforts recall a heady time in the history of psychiatry,when two competing groups, the followers of Sigmund Freud andthose who favored physical manipulation of the brain, each believedit had found a ""cure"" for mental illness. We knowmore today, but all the answers are not in.Freeman was born in 1916, the daughter of Lawrence Greenbaum, aprominent New York lawyer, and his wife, Sylvia. In 1940,after graduating from Bennington College, she became one of thefew women on the reporting staff of The Times. Sevenyears later, she married William Freeman, an editor.But Freeman had a troubled personal life. As she said inher 1951 book ""Fight Against Fears,"" she was angry, unhappyand unable to sleep. She also had a series ofailments, including sinus headaches.That Freeman turned to a psychoanalyst was not surprising. The teachingsof Freud, who believed that emotional problems in adulthood resultedfrom unresolved childhood conflicts, were at the height of popularitythen, and his solution was psychoanalysis -- spending years revisitingone's life history with a trained therapist.Still, Freeman's family and friends were displeased with her decision togo into analysis, responding, she said, with ""skepticism, jeers andoutright disapproval.""One acquaintance told her, ""You're crazy if you go to apsychiatrist.""This type of response stemmed from the prevailing beliefs of theera, which viewed mental illness scornfully and its victims asdeviants. Compounding this stereotype was the reliance on imposing statehospitals, like the one depicted in the 1948 Hollywood film""The Snake Pit,"" to house people with severe schizophrenia ordepression.In truth, many psychiatrists were trying to convert such institutions fromovercrowded, custodial facilities to modern medical centers. Believing that mentalillness stemmed from organic problems within the brain, psychiatrists haddevised a series of treatments, including electroshock therapy and lobotomy.It was these advances that Freeman relentlessly publicized as The Times'reporter on mental health. Writing scores of articles like ""ActionNow Urged on Mental Cases"" and ""State Mental Care EnteringNew Era,"" she willingly blurred the roles of reporter andadvocate.But Freeman's heart lay in promoting psychoanalysis, which she believed hadgreatly improved her own condition, most likely a severe formof neurosis. By helping her confront her childhood conflicts, whichincluded hating her mother, having sexual feelings for her fatherand envying her siblings, her analyst, she said, had curedher headaches and eased her psychological pain. Psychoanalysis, she wrote,""is part of today's struggle for survival.""Freeman and her analyst saw unexplored childhood and adult fears asthe cause of mental illness -- even of psychotic conditionslike schizophrenia. As she wrote, fear had ""incited the anger,the hatred, the guilt"" and thus ""split me into pieces.""Not surprisingly, perhaps, this emphasis on fear had great currency duringthe Cold War, leading former mental patients to start ""FightAgainst Fear"" clubs across the nation.From our modern perspective, viewing fear as the cause of mostmental illnesses seems quite outdated. Even Freud had intended thatonly neurotics, as opposed to people with more severe diseases,explore their childhood conflicts.Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that disorders like schizophrenia have agenetic basis and result from chemical abnormalities in the brain.While lobotomy has been abandoned, electroshock therapy is still used totreat depression. And over the last 50 years, scientists havedeveloped numerous effective medications to treat psychosis and other symptomsof mental illness.Meanwhile, the grand claims made by Freeman and others for psychoanalysishave been challenged. Researchers argue that the effectiveness of psychoanalysis,like other medical interventions, needs further validation through studies.Lucy Freeman wanted to hear none of this. According to herniece, Dale Schroedel, her aunt remained ""absolutely devoted and committedto Freud even when he became archaic.""Many therapists still agree with Freeman. Analysis, and its less intensivecousin, psychotherapy, remain a cornerstone of psychiatric practice.Freeman eventually wrote 78 books, many of them addressing the connectionof emotions and health.In so doing, she further fought the stigma that plagued herand others suffering from mental illness. ""By saving them,"" shewrote, ""in some way I also saved myself.""
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 17 (Xinhua)-- A new gene has been identified to link with higher risk of schizophrenia and depression, scientists reported on Thursday.Schizophrenia and related mood disorders are thought to arise from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, but researchers have had difficulty identifying the specific genes involved.Earlier studies have found a gene called DISC1, operating in a way that may contribute to the disorder, may make people susceptible to schizophrenia. However, the function of its encodedprotein has been unclear.The new research, appearing in the Nov. 18 issue of the journalScience, presented genetic and biochemical evidence suggesting that the DISC1 protein interacts with an enzyme called phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B), which in turn influences the activity of the signaling molecule cAMP.This signaling system has previously been implicated in learning, memory and mood in other experimental systems, which is consistent with the idea that alterations in the system may contribute to schizophrenia, according to the researchers.Damage to the gene PDE4B is also seen to increase the risk of developing mental illness. In addition, the researchers have discovered that DISC1 acts as a regulator for PDE4B, creating a 'pathway' between the two genes.""The new genetic link we have made to PDE4B and how that links back to DISC1 sheds much needed light on these debilitating disorders. It also suggests a new way of thinking about developingbetter and effective medicines,"" said David Porteous, a professor at the University of Edinburgh, Britain, who led the study.The new discovery may in the future lead to the eventual development of new drugs to treat mental health problems, the researchers said.""Our insights into the important role that the proteins PDE4B and DISC1 may play in the mis-function of the brain that leads to schizophrenia will lead our thinking in the development of new treatments for this disorder,"" said Peter Hutson, co-author of thestudy from the drug maker Merck Sharp & Dohme.
","Studies of famines years ago in Holland and China revealed that children born of severely malnourished mothers were twice as likely to develop schizophrenia as others. Scientists knew that vitamin A plays an important role in schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's; now they've discovered it acts upon a gene that influences neuron activity. Damage to the enzyme PDE4B increases the risk of developing mental illness, and researchers have discovered that the gene DISC1 acts as a regulator for PDE4B. Some scientists believe that lack of insulin in the brain may cause schizophrenia, but they reject ""insulin shock therapy,"" popular mid-20th century. ","Recent studies demonstrate that schizophrenia has a genetic basis and results from chemical abnormalities in the brain. The long-standing belief in problems of childhood as a cause has been largely discarded, but environmental factors are still seen as playing a role. Famine, malnutrition, or infection of a pregnant woman may cause changes in a developing fetal brain and heavy smoking of marijuana by teenagers may trigger a genetic predisposition. One study identifies insulin as a factor. The same 14 genes found missing in the brains of schizophrenics were missing in the muscles of diabetics. ",A renowned psychiatrist believed that schizophrenia was related to neurological impairments rather than childhood problems. Recent studies have demonstrated that disorders like schizophrenia have a genetic basis. Evidence that children from malnourished women are more likely to develop schizophrenia supports the theory that schizophrenia is caused by a genetic predisposition influenced by environmental triggers. Researchers found that levels of a chemical messenger in the brain called GABA were abnormal in schizophrenics and linked to a miswired network. For decades scientists linked schizophrenic symptoms to abnormalities in the brain chemical dopamine. Studies later identified genes that make people susceptible to schizophrenia. ,"Research shows that schizophrenia is caused by a genetic predisposition influenced by environmental triggers, including infection and severe maternal malnutrition, that disturb the developing fetal brain. Vitamin A, possibly proteins PDE4B and DISC1, and reduced GABA and insulin levels play roles in schizophrenia. Dopamine is linked to schizophrenic delusions and hallucinations. Other brain chemicals contribute to confusion and emotional unresponsiveness. Smoking pot in adolescence increases schizophrenic risk. Fourteen genes are missing in schizophrenics' brains. Drugs have been used to mimic schizophrenic changes in rats, possibly providing a first animal test subject. Schizophrenia is unrelated to childhood problems and fears. "

D0935,D0935-A,"Major League Baseball owners Friday conditionally approved therelocation of the Montreal Expos to Washington for the upcomingseason.The approval was ""subject to all conditions set forth in the BaseballStadium Agreement,"" signed by the Expos and Washington Mayor AnthonyWilliams.  The agreement calls for the District of Columbiagovernment to enact funding for a new ballpark by December 31.""This is another important step in finalizing the relocation of theMontreal Expos to Washington DC,"" baseball commissioner Bud Seligsaid. ""We are looking forward to finishing the last few steps,including the sale of the ballclub, and the rebirth of the club asthe Washington Nationals.""The last time a major league club moved cities was after the 1971season, when the Washington Senators became the Texas Rangers.Until a new ballpark is built, Washington will play at RFK Stadium.bb/nr04
The White House said Thursday it hoped that the city of Washingtonand Major League Baseball could still reach an agreement that wouldbring a professional team to the US capital city.US President George W. Bush, an avid fan and former team owner,""thought it was great that baseball would be coming to Washington,""spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters. ""Hopefully, they'll be ableto work things out.""The District of Columbia Council has voted to require privatefinancing for at least half the construction costs of a new ballparkfor the Nationals -- the former Montreal Expos, who are due to kickoff next season in their new city against Arizona on April 14.""The legislation is inconsistent with our carefully negotiatedagreement and is wholly unacceptable to Major League Baseball,"" MLBpresident and CEO Bob DuPuy said in a statement a day after Tuesday'svote.In the initial agreement between the team and Washington MayorAnthony A. Williams, the city was to be responsible for 531 milliondollars in bonds to finance the stadium plan.But under the legislation approved by the council, 50 percent of thecosts must come from private financing, or the approval for the planexpires.With the new provision in place, the Nationals may have to reopenbidding for a permanent home if private financial obligations are notmet.Asked whether Bush supported public financing for sports stadiums,McClellan replied: ""Those are local decisions.""
The Washington Nationals will make their debut in the nation's capital when they host the New York Mets in a major league baseball exhibition game on April 3.The game will be played at RFK Stadium, which will serve as the Nationals' temporary home before their new stadium is constructed.Formerly the Montreal Expos, the Nationals were officially relocated to Washington last month.After the move was approved the team's future in the District of Columbia briefly seemed in jeopardy when stadium funding hit a snag, but local officials have since approved a plan for public funding of a 400 million-dollar stadium.
Baseball fans in the nation's capital can start dreaming again abouttheir first opening day in 33 years.The District of Columbia Council voted 7-6 Tuesday to approvelegislation clearing the way for the Montreal Expos to move here nextseason and be renamed the Nationals. The measure allows the city tosell up to $584 million (euro436 million) in bonds for constructionof a 41,000-seat stadium about a 1.6 kilometers (one mile) south ofthe Capitol, and for renovations to RFK Stadium, where the team willplay next year.Ticket and team merchandise sales were to resume Wednesday. They weresuspended for a week because of uncertainty caused by changes thecouncil had made in the city's agreement with the team.""The Nationals are finally rounding third and heading for home,"" saidMayor Anthony A. Williams, who negotiated the move with major leaguebaseball officials.Williams said he will sign the bill as soon as it reaches his desk,leaving only baseball commissioner Bud Selig's approval of the RFKrenovations for the move to become final.The Nationals' home opener on April 14 would be the first regularseason major league game in the city since the Senators left tobecome the Texas Rangers after the 1971 season.The city almost struck out a week earlier when the council amendedWilliams' deal with baseball officials to require that half theconstruction costs be paid privately, or it would be voided.Baseball officials balked at the provision and threatened to take theteam elsewhere if the original deal wasn't approved by Dec. 31.But Williams won the necessary votes after he, Cropp and baseballofficials compromised during a day of intense negotiations Monday.The final bill calls for the city and baseball to split the cost ofinsurance that would limit the city's liability on cost overruns orconstruction delays. That amendment, introduced by Cropp, alsoreduces compensatory damages for the first year if the stadium isfinished late. Instead, the Washington Nationals would not have topay $5.3 million (euro3.96 million) in rent if the ballpark is notready for the 2008 season and the team has to remain at RFK.A second amendment, approved 10-3, deletes a sunset provision thatwould have canceled the deal if there was no private financing.Baseball officials were pleased with the vote and the guarantees thatthe stadium would be built as planned, Selig said.""We are also pleased that our discussions with Washington's electedleaders over the last several days have helped each side betterunderstand the concerns of the other,"" Selig said. ""We are now moreconfident than ever of a long and productive relationship with thecity of Washington as we move forward with this great project.""Williams sent Cropp a letter Tuesday, noting his commitment toinclude private financing in the stadium package. If there is nobetter proposal, Williams wrote, he will use a proposal from theCleveland-based Gates Group that would provide $100 million(euro74.66 million) in return for parking revenues near the stadium.Supporters of the measure also made some parliamentary maneuvers toensure the bill could not be reconsidered next year, when three newmembers who oppose the stadium project begin their terms.
The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Washington Post:It is time for Major League Baseball to stand up to Peter G.Angelos.Mr. Angelos, majority owner of the Baltimore Orioles, has used thethreat of litigation and a flair for brinkmanship to cast a pall overthe start of Washington baseball's first season in 34 years. Thecity's new team, the Nationals, begins regular season play Monday,with a home opener set for April 14, and it remains without a deal totelevise its games. Whatever the local enthusiasm for the Nationals --and it appears to be enormous -- the absence of a televisionbroadcasting outlet is an impediment that will undercut early attemptsto market the new team and give it a running start. This isunacceptable, and it is largely the doing of Mr. Angelos.Mr. Angelos opposed bringing baseball to Washington on the groundsthat it might further damage his Orioles franchise, whose fortuneshave nose-dived in the 12 years since he purchased the team. In thathe may have a point; last week, the Orioles reported that ticket saleswere running 12 percent behind last year's level. He has insisted thatMajor League Baseball should compensate him for the revenue hebelieves the Nationals will leech from the Orioles. According topublished reports, he has already received from baseball officials aguaranteed minimum price of $365 million should he decide to sell theOrioles. That's more than twice the amount Mr. Angelos paid for thefranchise in 1993 -- not bad for a team whose attendance has plummetedon his watch.If baseball officials want to indemnify Mr. Angelos for hisanticipated financial losses, that's fine -- but not if thecompensation would come at the Nationals' expense. Yet withnegotiations in the eleventh hour, the Orioles' owner has insisted ona prejudicial television broadcasting arrangement that would hold theNationals' financial fortunes hostage to his own whims indefinitely.Claiming a highly dubious exclusive right to broadcast all baseball inthis region, Mr. Angelos says Nationals games could be shown on hisown Orioles regional network; in return for airing its games, he sayshe would offer the Washington team a ``fair and appropriate fee'' --but not an equity stake in the network or a percentage of broadcastprofits. In fact, such a deal is a rip-off that would deflate theNationals' value and imperil the task of finding a buyer for thefranchise -- an orphan that is now the collective property ofbaseball's 29 team owners. What prospective Nationals' owner wouldcede control of broadcasting rights to a rival -- to say nothing of arival as truculent as Mr. Angelos? Might as well trade away the team'sbest sluggers and star pitchers.Mr. Angelos has threatened to sue unless he gets his way. Evidentlyhoping to avoid the drawn-out, bare-knuckled litigation for which heis notorious, baseball officials have kept negotiations alive. But thetalks have gone on for six months, and time's up. The season startsnext week, and Washington's baseball-starved fans want to tune in.Lawyers say Mr. Angelos's legal position is weak. It's time for MajorLeague Baseball to fix a sensible broadcasting deal for the Nationals-- whether or not Mr. Angelos will play ball.
Still without approval from baseball club owners or the city theyplan to call home, the Washington Nationals were born Monday in a seaof red, white and blue. These are not your grandfather's WashingtonNationals, because those Nationals played in the American League andwere alternately called the Senators.The new National League Nationals were named not only before theyhave approval to play in the nation's capital, but also before theyhave a new owner.Major League Baseball, the owner of record, has moved so slowly onthe transfer and the sale of the team that a new owner isn'tguaranteed to be in place in time to make marketing plans for nextseason or to have a say in off-season player decisions.For what some people expect to be $400 million to $500 million, thenew guy doesn't get to name his team.""We need a name for marketing,"" Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operatingofficer, said Monday. ""We're not going to have an owner for sometime. What if we don't have an owner by the start of springtraining?""Nearly 30 individuals or groups have submitted expressions ofinterest in buying the team. Baseball expects about half of thatnumber to bid seriously when the time comes to put up their money.One owner said Monday that he believed the leading contender for theteam was Mark Broxmeyer, a Long Island builder, but another hopefulsaid there was no way anyone could be a leading contender because thefirst dollar hasn't been bid.If there is a leader in the bidding, having nothing to do withfinances, it could be the group headed by Stan Kasten, who for manyyears was the president of the Atlanta Braves. Kasten has beenexploring multiple opportunities in multiple sports, but if hedecides to reach for the Nationals, he would have an advantage overother prospective buyers.Why? Study recent baseball history. The winning bidder for the BostonRed Sox three years ago was John Henry's group, which was loaded withbaseball people who had a close relationship with Commissioner BudSelig. He might not have known it at the time, but Cablevision'sCharles F. Dolan never really had a chance. Kasten has had a good,long relationship with Selig.The Washington bidding will be a show worth watching. Not long afterMajor League Baseball took control of the Expos, baseball peopletalked about an eventual sale bringing in $400 million, giving theother 29 teams a rewarding payday for their $120 million purchase.Then the economy turned south, and some people felt baseball would befortunate to get $200 million. Maybe that's why baseball officialsdragged their feet in deciding where to put the Expos. They weretrying to wait out the economy.Time hasn't done much for the economy, but it did give baseball timeto find a knight on a big white horse. The Washington mayor, AnthonyWilliams, came riding in and pledged that the District of Columbiawould build a new ballpark for the new team, whatever the cost, whichsome estimates say could exceed $600 million.The new owner, whose team will play at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium forthe first three seasons, will have what might be the best stadiumdeal ever. The Nationals will pay nothing for the construction of thepark, pay $3.5 million a year for rent and receive allstadium-related revenue from tickets, concessions, parking, signs andnaming-rights fees.The prospect of getting that combined revenue and money from aregional sports network to be shared with the Baltimore Orioles willdrive up the sale price.A financial investment adviser said Monday that he would never advisea client to pay $400 million for the Nats, although maybe $300million, but he acknowledged the possibility that some bidder mightmake a $400 million bid if he really wanted the team and wanted tobreak away from the crowd.Just like the old Nationals, who became the Senators in 1957, theseNationals will have the right to change their name. ""When they moveinto the new stadium, the owner will have the right to petition tochange the name,"" DuPuy said.Club owners are expected to approve the team's move within the nexttwo weeks, whether or not baseball officials have concluded anagreement with Peter Angelos, the Orioles' owner, on compensation forintruding on what he considers his turf. The Washington city councilwill vote on stadium financing next month.Meanwhile, even though no owner is in place to decide which playershe might want or how much he would spend on them, Jim Bowdencontinues to do his job as interim general manager.Bowden has already demonstrated his acumen in running a low-budgetoperation, having served as general manager of the economicallydeprived Cincinnati Reds for 10 1/2 years. And in the space of a fewdays last week, Bowden signed half an infield's worth of free agents-- third baseman Vinny Castilla and shortstop Cristian Guzman -- andtraded for a productive, if volatile, outfielder in Jose Guillen.Bowden hasn't been told if he can exceed the $41 million payroll withwhich the Expos opened last season, but baseball officials haveestimated that the Nationals will take in at least $100 million morein revenue than the Expos did. That should give Bowden a little moreto play with.Even if he doesn't know who the new owner will be.
Major League Baseball on Wednesday rejected as ""wholly unacceptable""a stadium financing plan approved the day before by the WashingtonCity Council, throwing into grave doubt the city's plans to bring theformer Montreal Expos here next season.Baseball's statement came in response to legislation the Councilapproved late Tuesday night requiring that half of the riverfrontstadium's projected $280 million construction costs be paid forprivately, delivering a stinging rejection of a deal struck by MayorAnthony Williams and baseball officials to finance the ballparkalmost entirely with tax dollars.On Wednesday, a grim Williams expressed pessimism that his plan couldbe salvaged. ""I do think baseball is in jeopardy,"" he said. ""Thedream of 33 years is now close to dying.""Critics of Williams' plan said he was exaggerating the threat thatMajor League Baseball would take the team, renamed the Nationals, toanother city. They said baseball had few alternatives, since theNationals are scheduled to play next season in Robert F. KennedyMemorial Stadium in Washington while their new home is built. Oncethe team is in Washington, the city's negotiating position will bestrengthened, they argued.But in a statement, Bob DuPuy, president of Major League Baseball,called the legislation ""wholly unacceptable"" and gave the city untilDec. 31, the previously agreed upon deadline, to approve the originalfinancing deal. After that date, baseball said, it will beginconsidering other sites.""The legislation approved by the District of Columbia City Councillast night does not reflect the agreement we signed,"" the statementsaid.DuPuy said baseball had stopped promotional activities for theNationals and would refund deposits for season tickets.Under the deal Williams reached with baseball owners to bring theExpos to Washington next spring, less than 20 percent of the stadiumwould have been financed by private funds, specifically through rentpayments from the team.Amid the uncertainty, the one clear thing on Wednesday was the starkand surprisingly forceful message the Council sent about growingpublic resentment toward the high cost of sports stadiums.With land acquisition and service improvements, Williams hadprojected that the total stadium package would cost $440 million. Butthe city's chief financial officer has put the cost closer to $535million, and other estimates have gone higher.
The city's top two political leaders cleared the way Monday night forMajor League Baseball in the nation's capital, after daylongnegotiations to guarantee the construction of a stadium that baseballofficials demanded to relocate the former Montreal Expos here.The city's mayor, Anthony A. Williams, and the City Council chairman,Linda W. Cropp, agreed, together with baseball officials, toalterations in the deal the mayor made with Major League Baseball inSeptember that used mostly taxpayer dollars for stadium construction.Cropp wanted to minimize the use of public money to build a stadium,which has been estimated to cost as much as $585 million.The compromise will be voted on Tuesday by the full 13-member councilat its last meeting of the year.Cropp persuaded fellow council members last week to adopt anamendment requiring private financing for the new stadium, where therenamed Washington Nationals team would play.The compromise reached late Monday assures that 50 percent of thestadium will be privately financed, said the mayor's spokesman ChrisBender.Several private financing possibilities already have beeninvestigated by city officials, Bender said, including a parkingmeter plan that is expected to generate $100 million in upfrontrevenue for the city. If no other private deals are found, Bendersaid, the city expects to sign onto the parking arrangement offeredby the Cleveland-based Gates Group.In return for assurances that private financing is viable, Cropp saidshe would drop her legislative language requiring a specific amountof private financing, a demand which had aroused the ire of baseballsupporters since they feared that it would torpedo the team's chancesof moving here.Baseball officials also agreed to reduce the $19 million in damagesthe city would incur if the new stadium, to be built by the AnacostiaRiver in Southeast Washington, did not open by March 2008. Instead,the city would forfeit a $5 million yearly rental payment it wouldearn when the Nationals team plays at Robert F. Kennedy MemorialStadium, which it is set to do beginning in 2005.Baseball officials also agreed to split the cost of constructioninsurance with the city to limit taxpayer liability, Bender said.Williams said that having a team was not just about baseball, butalso ""about revitalizing the Anacostia River, creating new jobs,bringing in new tax revenues and creating a new source of civilpride.""
The Montreal Expos can move to Washington, changetheir name and never play the Canadian national anthem again,but they cannot seem to go anywhere without the NewYork Mets following along for a photo-op.Despite everything that has changed with this vagabond franchise, its trustysidekick remains the same. More than 35 years after theMets welcomed the Expos to the major leagues and morethan five months after they ushered them out, the Metsonce again rode shotgun into history on Wednesday.The spring training schedule-makers have quite a sense of symmetry. TheExpos played their first regular-season game against the Mets in1969 and their last game against the Mets on Oct.3, so it was only fitting that the Washington Nationalswould play their first game against the Mets on openingday in the Grapefruit League.If anyone missed the nostalgic significance of the event, the Metswill travel to Washington for the Nationals' first game atRFK Stadium, an exhibition on April 3. By the endof the regular season, these two National League East companionswill have met 26 times. ""It's getting really weird,"" Washingtonoutfielder Brad Wilkerson said. ""It's always us and them.""In the first regular-season game between thesefranchises, Tom Seaver started forthe Mets at Shea Stadium and Coco Laboy powered theExpos to an 11-10 victory. In their last meeting, TomGlavine started for the Mets at Shea and Todd Zeilehomered to deal the Expos an 8-1 defeat. On Wednesdayat Space Coast Stadium, Glavine started again for the Metsand the Nationals came back for a 5-3 victory.""To start the last game and start the first game,"" Glavinesaid, ""that's pretty cool.""The Mets can take solace in lessons of the past. Whenthey dropped the opener to this franchise in 1969, theywent on to win the World Series. ""Maybe that's anomen for our team,"" said Mets outfielder Ron Calloway, whocame over from the Expos this winter. ""Or maybe it'sjust a reach.""To celebrate their first game, the Nationals wore their regular-season homeuniforms instead of their batting-practice jerseys. They got their firsthit from shortstop Christian Guzman and their first home runfrom outfielder Jose Guillen, both off-season acquisitions. The Nationals havesold 20,000 season-ticket packages in Washington, but they drew amore modest sellout of 7,558 in Viera on Wednesday. Afterthe third inning, there was still a traffic jam outsidethe stadium, with ticket-holders trying to get into the grassparking lot.""There is a lot of enthusiasm and anticipation,"" Washington manager FrankRobinson said. ""There is interest in this ball club thathasn't been there before.""The Nationals were not the only players on a new team.Doug Mientkiewicz started his first game for the Mets atfirst base and made a nifty scoop on a doubleplay. Kazuo Matsui started his first spring-training game at secondbase and successfully charged two grounders, bare-handing one and short-hoppingthe other. Carlos Beltran was in the Mets' lineup forthe first time and went 1 for 3 with asearing single. ""I was a little nervous,"" Beltran said. ""Butthat's just me.""With Mike Piazza and Cliff Floyd back in Port St. Lucie,and Mike Cameron rehabilitating from wrist surgery, Beltran was thesecond-most popular reason to watch Wednesday's game. ""Whenever I throwmy last warm-up pitch, I always turn around to makesure everybody is ready,"" Glavine said after working two shutoutinnings. ""To see the new guys we had out there,and to see Carlos in center field, it was agood feeling.""Even the Mets' rookie manager, Willie Randolph, was bouncing out ofthe dugout to greet players coming off the field. Afterthe Mets hired Randolph in November, one of the firstcongratulatory calls he received was from Robinson. And after Randolphput on a Mets' uniform for the first time lastmonth, one of his first calls was to Robinson.This game will undoubtedly be remembered as the Nationals' introduction tobaseball, but it also included two African-American managers who haverelied on each other for support.""I think Willie is going to do really well,"" Robinson said.Randolph seemed much more comfortable than Omar Minaya, the Mets' generalmanager, who could be forgiven for forgetting for a daywhich organization signs his paycheck. Minaya, the Expos' general managerthe past three years, helped make the Nationals a competitorand the Mets a contender. In the first of manyreunions with his former team, Minaya wore a blue hatwith a white M on the front. The hat wasnot a new style released by the Mets. It wasworn by the Montreal Royals, Jackie Robinson's first professional baseballteam.""I'm happy today, and I'm also a little bit sad,"" Minayasaid. ""I'm happy for Washington, but I'm sad for Montreal.It can be sort of emotional. There is a lotof newness here today.""As a sign that not everything had changed, the former first-rounddraft choice Aaron Heilman allowed three runs in two inningsfor the Mets, wasting a pair of run-scoring hits fromJason Phillips. Felix Heredia, who frustrated Yankees' fans last season,gave up the winning run in the sixth.Heredia did not get any help from his former Yankees' teammate,infielder Miguel Cairo, who booted a ground ball at thirdbase to score the run.The Mets and the Yankees have had many players go backand forth across town over the years, but the Metsand the Nationals share a more common history. The twofranchises always seem to be starting over at the sametime, and often on the same field.
Cox News Service WASHINGTON On the day when Washington's new baseballteam won its first exhibition game, President Bush honored JackieRobinson in a congressional ceremony on Wednesday and welcomed thechampion Boston Red Sox to the White House. The ceremonymarking the Red Sox first World Series win since 1918was an upbeat event despite political overtones. Pitcher Curt Schilling,who presented Bush with a team jersey, campaigned for thepresident last year. But team executives backed Massachusetts Sen. JohnKerry. John Henry, a Kerry backer and the team's principalowner, was ill and skipped the event. Red Sox GeneralManager Theo Epstein also endorsed Kerry, saying last year, ""It'sbeen four days and I'm finally starting to believe theRed Sox won the World Series and I still can'tbelieve George Bush is president of the United States."" Epsteinattended the White House south lawn event, but sat withthe audience instead of joining the team and Bush onstage. Massachusetts Sens. Kerry and Ted Kennedy, two of Bush'sharshest critics, attended the event, though Kerry was late inarriving from the Robinson ceremony at the Capitol. Bush spottedKerry as he arrived. ""Good to see you,"" Bush toldhis former foe. ""I like to see Senator Kerry, exceptwhen we're fixing to debate. If you know what Imean."" Bush, former managing partner of the Texas Rangers, greetedthe Red Sox with a jab aimed at the factthat they had not won the championship since 1918. ""So,like, what took you so long?"" he joked, noting thatWoodrow Wilson was president the last time the Red Soxwon the World Series. Bush praised the Red Sox fortheir hustling style of play and touted their organization forits long-standing charitable programs, including The Jimmy Fund. Just beforewelcoming the team to the White House, Bush participated ina Congressional Gold Medal ceremony for the late Robinson, thefirst black to play in Major League Baseball. ""This isa guy who inspired little 7-year-olds to dream of wearing42 and dashing for home in Brooklyn,"" Bush said, ""anda 7-year-old like me hoping to get his Topps baseballcard, even though I was a Giants fan."" ""He wasan amazing guy. And his story was powerful then andit is powerful today,"" Bush said. The baseball events cameas the Washington Nationals, who moved to the city fromMontreal during the off-season, defeated the New York Mets 5-3in their first exhibition game in Florida. Bush is expectedto throw the ceremonial first pitch when the Nationals playtheir first regular season home game on April 14. Thename of a prominent Democrat will also be associated withthat game. The Nationals will play in Robert F. KennedyMemorial Stadium, named for the late Democratic senator and attorneygeneral. Ken Herman's e-mail address is khermancoxnews.com
",National League Nationals were named before they have approval to play in Washington and a new owner. Major League baseball remains the owner of the Montreal Expos. The team will play at RFK stadium for its first three seasons. Settlement of a financing plan for a new ballpark led to the approval of the move of The Expos to DC. The Washington Nationals will debut in an exhibition game against the New York Mets in Florida. The first regular season home game will be on April 14. Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos opposed bringing baseball to Washington. ,"Major League Baseball owners conditionally approved the relocation of the Montreal Expos, to be called the Nationals, to Washington DC in 2005. No owner was in place. Mayor Anthony Williams pledged that DC would build a new ballpark. The first three seasons the team would play at RFK Stadium. City Council chairman Linda Cropp insisted half the construction cost be paid for privately but a compromise was reached. The Cleveland-based Gates Group offered $100 million in return for parking revenues. Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos claimed a monopoly on regional baseball broadcasting. Public resentment grew concerning the high stadium cost. ","After 33 years of no baseball, in late December 2004, all parties agreed to move the Montreal Expos baseball team to Washington, D.C. After many snags, Mayor Williams reached a compromise approved by both Major League Baseball and the city council. The team, renamed the Nationals, will play in RFK Stadium until a city-financed, $500-million stadium is completed for the 2008 season. The Nationals sold 20,000 season tickets. They will play the first game in Washington on April 3 and the first regular season game there on the 14th. President Bush will attend. The Orioles owner continues to threaten litigation. ","Major league baseball owners approved the relocation of the Montreal Expos to Washington, D.C., on 3 December if the DC government could provide funding for a new ballpark by 31 December. An agreement was reached on 22 December for a 400-million-dollar stadium. The new Washington Nationals would play in RFK Stadium until the new ballpark could be built. The Nationals won their first exhibition game in Florida on 22 March, defeating the NY Mets 5-3, and were scheduled to make their DC debut in an exhibition game against the Mets at RFK stadium on 3 April.

The sharing of Robert F. Kennedy Stadium by Major League Soccer champion D.C.United and the Washington Nationals of Major League Baseball has resulted in asoccer pitch that isn't rectangular.""It's clearly not acceptable, but we understand that it's been a challenge foreverybody, and we just have to be patient,"" United president Kevin Payne saidTuesday. ""Nobody wants the field to be off.""Officials at United's 4-3 home loss to New England on Saturday filed a reportwith MLS saying the field was lopsided. Two officials measured the field bywalking it, and they determined that one corner-to-corner diagonal was about 6meters longer than the other.""It's unscientific, but the referees are pretty good at measuring by walking itoff,"" MLS spokesman Dan Courtemanche said.Even once that's fixed, there's another issue: the way the grass ismowed.Right now, the pitch is set up in such a way that the lines cut in the outfieldgrass for the baseball team are at an odd angle for United games. Normally forsoccer, grass is mowed perpendicular to the sidelines, which helps officials bygiving them a straight line against which to judge offside calls.""It is sort of an optical illusion, confusing to everybody,"" Payne said. ""It'svery hard on the linesmen.""One possible solution would be to change where the soccer field is set up,putting it parallel to the Nationals' first-base line. But that would mean thesoccer field would have to be smaller, something Payne doesn'twant.""We certainly believe that everything will be worked out,"" Courtemanchesaid.D.C. United and the Nationals are sharing RFK, a venue used for the 1994 WorldCup and frequently a site of U.S. World Cup qualifiers, until 2008 while a newbaseball stadium is being built. When the soccer team plays, the baseball moundis lowered, and the infield dirt is covered with temporary turf.Pitchers have had problems with the mound, which will be stripped down andrebuilt with new clay next week.The problem with the possible misalignment of the field's shape was firstreported by The Washington Post.
The Washington Nationals are on pace to earn a pre-taxprofit of $20 million this season, reversing the fortunes of one ofbaseball's biggest economic underperformers during the past decade andincreasing the potential value of the franchise as Major LeagueBaseball attempts to sell it, according to Nationals officials andpeople involved in the sale.The projected profits are fueled by robust attendance, strongsponsorship and television deals, and one of the lowest playerpayrolls in baseball. The Nationals have swung from a $10 million losslast year as the Montreal Expos into the top half of teams, ranked onthe basis of revenue and profits, according to people who closelyfollow baseball economics.``I think $20 million might be conservative,'' said AndrewZimbalist, who teaches economics at Smith College and writesfrequently about baseball. ``If they go to the postseason, you can addanother $5 million or $10 million. And when they get the new stadium,it will go up even more.''The team's financial success could play a major role in determiningthe Nationals' sale price. MLB, which bought the franchise for $120million in 2002, has received eight bids, most of them believed to bebetween $300 million and $400 million. MLB officials say they hope toreach a decision on a new owner this summer and are currentlyinterviewing prospective buyers. Most MLB teams sell for between twoand three times their revenue, according to investment bankers, so theNationals' projected revenue of approximately $129 million this yearcould push the sales price to $400 million or more.``It could end up toward the high end of the range,'' said ScottLevine, a sports team valuation expert and director at Stout RisiusRoss Inc., a Detroit-based financial advisory firm. Levine said hethinks the price also could go higher given what he called ``the egofactor'' among the bidding groups. ``You are dealing with people worthbillions of dollars,'' he said. ``To some extent, this is an expensivetoy.''The Nationals play in 44-year-old Robert F. Kennedy MemorialStadium, which seats 45,250 and has none of the cash-generatingamenities such as club seats and luxury suites modern sports stadiumsand arenas feature. Washington has pledged to build a $535 millionstadium along the Anacostia River in return for baseball's decision tomove the team here.Some sports experts cautioned that the Nationals' financial successcould be fleeting. ``You went from a greatly depressed market inMontreal to one where pent-up demand was dramatic,'' said DavidCarter, who teaches sports business at the University of SouthernCalifornia Marshall School of Business. ``Where you will really beable to tell how financially successful this team will be is in thenext several years, where we find if the revenue numbers aresustainable.''``They are enjoying every bit of their honeymoon, but everythinglooks great when you are in first place or within striking distance offirst place,'' said Raul Fernandez, one of the partners in the MCICenter sports complex, which includes the arena and the WashingtonWizards, Capitals and Mystics. ``But building great franchises takesdedication, effort and smart moves over a longer period of time thanhalf of a season.''Nationals President Tony Tavares, who declined to comment publiclyon specific revenue numbers, said he had counted on the excitementover baseball's return to Washington after a 34-year absence when hecalculated his projections on how the franchise would fare financiallyin its first season in the city. He might not have counted on the teambeing in first place in the National League East Division this late inthe season, which could also spur attendance.The Nationals, who this month surpassed the 1 million mark inattendance, are averaging 31,912 tickets sold per game, 13th highestin the league and one spot ahead of the Baltimore Orioles, who areselling 30,756 tickets per game, according to league statistics. Thatputs the Nationals on track to sell about 2.5 million tickets thisyear. With about 22,000 season tickets sold per game, at an averageprice of $24 per seat, plus an average walk-up crowd of more than8,000 per game, Washington will generate nearly $60 million at thegate this year after local taxes.Researcher Julie Tate contributed to this report.
Jerry Bush remembers the day baseball died as ifit were yesterday, not 34 years ago, not a lifetimeago.It was Sept. 30, 1971, at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium,the final game for the Washington Senators before their hatedowner, Robert Short, moved the team to Arlington, Texas, tobecome the Rangers.With two outs in the top of the ninth and theSenators ahead, hundreds of angry, frustrated, memento-hunting fans piled ontothe field, raced around the bases and tore numbers offthe scoreboard. Bush, a 17-year-old high school senior at thetime, pulled up a chunk of emerald sod and keptit in a shoe box in his bedroom for years.Over the next three decades, he flirted with other teams: theOrioles, the Yankees. But like a scorned lover who justcan't get over it, none of them stuck in hisheart. None until this year.On Thursday, Bush will join 45,500 other fans at RFK Stadiumfor the sold-out home opener of the newly minted WashingtonNationals, formerly the Montreal Expos, who have brought baseball backto this baseball-starved city.""I'm getting goose bumps when I hear the name Nats onthe radio,"" said Bush, a middle-school technology teacher in MontgomeryCounty, Md., who unashamedly wears his Nationals baseball cap andjersey to school some days.In this buttoned-down city of transients, power brokers and the politicallyobsessed, giddy displays of nostalgia are not the norm. Butbaseball has a way of doing that to grown menand, occasionally, women.""Everywhere I go, people stop me to talk baseball,"" said CityCouncilman Jack Evans. ""They yell from cars. They grab meat meetings. I see people wearing the hats all overthe city. At a Ward 7 event on Friday, twodozen people, mostly men 40 and over, said how proudthey were to have a team back.""Never mind that few here can name more than a playeror two on their new team. Never mind that theclub drew just 748,550 fans in Montreal last year, whenit finished last in the National League East with a67-95 record. Never mind that the Nationals' hat features alone ""W"" above the bill, an uncomfortable reminder to somepeople in this overwhelmingly Democratic city of their Republican president.A new day has dawned in a new city. The Nationalsare 5-4 and tied for first in their division. Thehoneymoon has begun. While the common folk buy team T-shirtsand hats, the rich and powerful have been buying upbehind-the-dugout seats. Already, the Nationals have sold more than 22,000season tickets, prompting confident team officials to project total attendanceof 2.5 million for the year.""The good news is we haven't had to aggressively market theteam yet,"" said Chartese Berry, the Nationals' vice president forcommunications. ""We were just absolutely bombarded by folks who wereinterested.""The home opener will have all the trappings of a Washingtonevent. President George W. Bush -- once a part-owner ofthe Texas Rangers -- will throw out the ceremonial firstpitch, using the final ball from the final Washington Senatorsgame, which they forfeited to the Yankees because the fansstormed the field. There will be a flyover of militaryjets. And Chris Matthews plans to tape his Thursday editionof ""Hardball"" on MSNBC from the RFK field.This being Washington, protests are also expected. Parents who want thecity to spend money on schools instead of a newbaseball stadium. Advocates seeking congressional voting rights for the city.(Washington has only one non-voting seat in the House.) Criticsof President Bush. Opponents of the war in Iraq. (TheNationals are trying to negotiate a deal to let theNational Guard advertise and recruit at the stadium.)""I think Robert Kennedy would appreciate that,"" Mayor Anthony Williams, whoseentire public schedule on Thursday will involve baseball events, saidof the protests.The big question for marketing gurus and baseball fanatics alike ishow long the love affair will last. Could one abysmalExpos-like season kill it?It may come down to people like Jim Mauro. A Pittsburghnative who has lived in Washington for 25 years, hehas continued to cheer for his beloved Pirates. This yearmight be different.At an Orioles game in Baltimore this month, Mauro, a lawyer,glanced up at the scoreboard and noticed that the Phillieswere leading the Nationals. And he noticed something else: apang of dismay with his new home team.""It was an epiphany,"" said Mauro, 60, the president of ayouth baseball league in northwest Washington. ""I felt like Iwas becoming a Nationals fan. And I felt guilty aboutthe Pirates.""
The Washington Nationals finished their opening homestand tied for first place.It can't get much better than that.""We have a whole new outlook,"" catcher Brian Schneider said. ""Nowanything seems possible.""Nationals players are obviously happy to finally have a true homeafter going virtually unwatched as the vagabond Montreal Expos thepast two seasons. But many questions remain about this teamand baseball's future in the nation's capital.With a payroll still under $50 million, the Nationals aren't likelyto be able to stay in contention all season inthe difficult National League East, and the newness of thesport's return after 33 empty summers will soon wear off.Despite a face-lift, RFK Stadium remains a relic that is farfrom fan-friendly, and a new stadium on the banks ofthe Anacostia River not far from the Capitol won't beready until 2008 at the earliest.Meanwhile, the Nationals remain wards of Major League Baseball. Commissioner BudSelig says that he expects a sale to go throughby midseason. Earlier, the speculation was that it would becompleted by May.MLB bought the team for $120 million three years ago andhopes to sell it for triple that amount. So far,eight groups have said that they are interested in buyingthe Nationals.One is headed by Stan Kasten, the former president of theBraves, Hawks and Thrashers. ""I'd like to see him getit,"" Braves manager Bobby Cox said during his team's two-gameseries at RFK. ""I think it would be good forbaseball. I was hoping he might be around while wewere here.""Most of the prospective ownership groups are keeping a low profile.That certainly isn't the case with the return of baseballto Washington, however.President Bush threw out the ceremonial first pitch and more than600 media members were on hand as the Nationals wontheir home opener 5-3 over Arizona before a sellout of45,596 at RFK Stadium. ""It was like a World Series,""rookie outfielder Ryan Church said.The Nationals swept the three-game series with the Diamondbacks before losingtwice to Florida and then splitting with the Braves. Allthe crowds were larger than the best for the Exposlast season, but the dip from the opener was dramaticconsidering that the Nationals have a season-ticket base of about22,000.""We just need to keep winning,"" said coach Tom McCraw, aplayer on the last Washington Senators team in 1971. ""That'sthe only way to keep people excited.""Guy Curtright writes for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. E-mail: gcurtright@ajc.com
c. San Francisco ChronicleThe Washington Nationals take some getting used to, from the tipof their caps (stolen from the second incarnation of theSenators) to the bottoms of their pseudo old-school uniforms withthe blocky block lettering and numerals (stolen, as near aswe can tell, from the late 1950s Packers).Indeed, when you think of how, as the Montreal Expos, theywere systematically starved to death to make the Nationals possible... well, you have a built-in rooting interest for thenew team to fail miserably.But then you look at manager Frank Robinson, face of thefranchise, and the kind of guy who does the Hallof Fame honor by letting himself be included, and withall that, you come to the realization that rooting forthe Nationals might not be such a bad idea afterall.Or that when they finally do blow up, that he's wellon his way to his next job.Robinson is the living embodiment of baseball's conscience, of the classof African Americans who saved the game from its ownsmothering sterility and did so despite the most revolting racialinequities. He took plenty, but gave back every bit ofit and then some. It is his intention to handout a bit more to the Giants in this weekend'sthree-game set that begins this evening.Robinson was fun to watch as a player, fun to watchas a manager and even fun to watch when hewas disciplining players for on-field brawls. In short, he justlooks as baseball ought to want to look -- 69going on 53, and looking ahead rather than behind becauseahead still has the chance to be really interesting.The Nats (a lame enough nickname, but exactly what you shouldget when you think ""Nationals"" evokes any kind of civicemotion) are still the Expos in every way but one-- they are playing in a new town. The oldone was a perfectly good baseball town treated badly bya series of bad owners, the last ones being theother 29 owners.A decade ago, the Expos dealt away nearly the entire contentsof what had been a superbly productive farm system, andreplaced those contents with, well, nothing. Even now, they area fairly faceless lot, with the most recognizable name forlocal consumption being the mighty ex-Giant-and-a-half Livan Hernandez.Robinson coaxed a couple of winning seasons out of the strip-minedExpos before it all caved in last year, and anew challenge, however manufactured, has always worked for him.In Cleveland, where he was not only the first African Americanmanager but the man who came closest to carrying offthe Indians' ridiculous all-red uniforms, he took a bad teamand drove it toward the middle of the standings. InSan Francisco, he took a hideous team and got itto win. In Baltimore, he took a horrendous team andimproved it by 32 wins in a season.This is Robinson's fourth year with the Nats, and when hecompletes it, he will have finally managed the same teamfor four consecutive years. If it continues at its currentpace, this team will bring him 85 wins, give ortake.The Nats are an odd team in that they don't seemto have a readily definable shape. Hernandez is the team'sbest pitcher by a margin as wide as his ...well, let's give that analogy a break for once. Thebatting order has been more productive than its name-recognition factor,which is good news both for veterans seeking a homesuch as Jose Guillen and Vinny Castilla, and Expo liferssuch as Brad Wilkerson and Brian Schneider.You, of course, don't care that much. Your favorite team hasa bullpen by convention, a left fielder who sends crypticnotes over the Internet while he recoups from what seemsto be an endless series of knee surgeries, and apredilection for beating up on the harmless and losing 2-of-3to everyone else. The Washington Nationals mean next to nothingto you.But credit must be awarded to teams, and men, who deserveit, and Frank Robinson remains on scholarship with anyone whohas ever paid attention to the game. Even his timein San Francisco helped set up the team for itsrun of glory in the late '80s.So forgive him his uniform, and the tale of shame thathelped make the Nationals possible. Ignore the future, which aslikely as not will have the Nats as a sickfranchise struggling for attention in a football town.Just look at the manager. He may seem like a dinosaur,but the meteor hasn't yet hit the Earth that couldmake him extinct. He is too smart, too headstrong, toowise to limp in. Trust us on this -- FrankRobinson has plenty of miles left on the warranty.E-mail Ray Ratto at rrattosfchronicle.com.
No doubt RFK Stadium will exude considerably more baseballcharm on a night when the humidity isn't a thousandpercent.That's not a typo.If 100 percent humidity is the point at which we startgrowing gills, then there has to be an exponentially higherscale of measurement when a dorsal fin appears and onestarts developing a taste for bait.But hot teams make for hot times.The Washington Nationals, having won seven in a row and 10of 11 before last night, and the Mariners, as hotas they've been all season, clashed for the first timeever last night, and the most remarkable aspect may bethat no one swooned until the seventh inning.Perhaps it was the humidity and a threat of thunderstorms thatkept the D.C. crowd under 30,000 -- less than two-thirdsof RFK's stated capacity of 45,250 for baseball.Perhaps Mariners-Nationals isn't quite the same as Red Sox-Cubs on themarquee of interleague matchups.Or perhaps this place just doesn't get it yet.Yeah, it's still early. And school isn't out yet.And the Nationals are the first team to play regularly inthe nation's capital since Watergate was just an apartment complex.So maybe we should cut the fans some slack for notbeing up to speed on recent developments.Besides, the Nationals have virtually no season-ticket base, given that theformer Montreal Expos had probably less notice of their newsituation than 20 percent of the General Motors work forcewill soon be getting.Still, if a team is brand new in a town thatsupposedly has been thirsting, nay, lusting for major league baseballthese past 34 years, and it's in first place andplaying extremely well, shouldn't the crowds be bigger?Certainly if the Mariners were in the Nationals' position -- firstplace in a division where every team is playing above.500 -- Safeco Field would be hosting thousands more thanthe 33,718 fans Seattle has averaged at home through 29dates this year.That figure, by the way, puts the Mariners third in averageattendance in the American League behind the Yankees and Angels,and fourth (behind the Red Sox, Yankees and Angels) inpercentage of stadium capacity.Through 31 dates, the Nationals are averaging about 2,000 fewer atRFK, admittedly not one of the prime drawing cards asstadiums go. Opened in 1961 as District of Columbia Stadium,one of the first multipurpose venues in the much-copied soup-tureenstyle that was all the rage for a generation, theNationals' ballpark is indeed the team's best argument for thenew half-billion-dollar home it wants.Washington's football fans may have a soft spot for the place,but as a baseball park RFK is soulless, charmless andutterly unremarkable in its bland symmetry.To which all real baseball fans should respond with a unanimous""so what?""It shouldn't, absolutely shouldn't, be the stadium that matters. Yet we'veall been conditioned, not just by Major League Baseball butby every ""brand"" making a pitch for our attention, thatpackaging comes before content.As a result, we lose perspective.Consider, for example, that the 26-33 Mariners are the statistical equal,sometimes the better, of the 35-26 Nationals.In batting average the Mariners are 12th of 14 American Leagueteams, the Nationals 16th of 16 National League teams; intotal hits, the Mariners are 13th, the Nationals 10th; inhome runs, the Mariners are 13th, the Nationals 16th; inon-base percentage, the Mariners 11th, Nationals 12th; in ERA, theMariners eighth, Nationals seventh; in strikeouts by pitching staff, Mariners14th, Nationals 15th, and in opponents' batting average, Mariners fourth,Nationals sixth.Even after walking seven Nationals in the final two innings oflast night's 9-3 loss, the Mariners, seventh in the ALin walks, have walked fewer batters than the Nationals, whoare 11th in the NL.What to make of all this?""I honestly have no clue what anyone should take from that,""said Mariners manager Mike Hargrove.Hargrove is right not to read too much into numbers thatare made malleable by many variables between leagues and evendivisions within the leagues, not to mention the vicissitudes ofthe schedule.Nevertheless, Seattle fans can appreciate there's not much difference -- statistically-- between the Mariners and a team that, for themoment, is a contending ballclub. A bounce here, a breakthere, and the Mariners are maybe three games out offirst place.That their fans have responded so well despite a losing recordthis season is worth noting, though it's likely many ofthose fans are showing up because Safeco Field is anice ballpark.We'll never know how many fans the Mariners would draw ifthey played in a place like RFK Stadium, but I'dbe willing to bet a decline of 5,000 per game.Which makes it imperative that they realize, at 26 winsand 33 losses, just how incredibly lucky they are.
As the Washington Nationals left the field with their12th consecutive home victory on Saturday night, the sound systemat Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium played the theme musicfrom ""The Natural,"" a movie about mystical and magical occurrencesin baseball.Livan Hernandez, the starting pitcher who raised his record to 11-2,had taken the same walk to the dugout in theprevious inning and waved his red cap to the 39,881customers applauding him.Now, Marlon Byrd, the left fielder who was also cheered, wascongratulated by his teammates for his two hits, his tworuns batted in, his stolen base, his throw to cutdown a runner at second base and his diving catch.But Byrd got more than pats on the back when histeammate Jose Guillen sneaked up and smacked his face witha pie made of shaving cream. ""It means you playeda good game,"" Byrd said with a smile over theblast of salsa music coming from the clubhouse stereo. ""Ihope to get a whole bunch of those.""The Nationals have played many good games in this surprising season,their first here. Despite a 9-5 loss to the TorontoBlue Jays on Sunday, Washington is in first place inthe National League East, three games ahead of Atlanta.Despite modest hitting -- the Nationals are second to last inthe majors in runs -- they use pitching, defense andthe managing of Frank Robinson to win, often coming frombehind. ""A lot of people don't believe in this team,""Hernandez said, referring to those outside Washington. ""I like itlike that, because you can show people.""He recalled playing in Canada last season, when the team wasthe Montreal Expos and fans were few at Olympic Stadium.""It's good when you've got 40,000 people screaming for you,""Hernandez said. ""It's different than 5,000 people. Everybody is happyabout the fans and wants to say, 'Thank you.""'Hernandez and the Expos spent last season in last place whileplaying most of their home games in the province ofQuebec and some of them in the territory of PuertoRico. Now they are thriving in the District of Columbia,but their franchise transfer still has many loose ends.The team is still owned by Major League Baseball, which boughtit for $120 million in 2002 and is brokering asale among nine bidders. The Nationals play in a 43-year-oldstadium that has many problems, including vandalism and theft fromsome players' cars in the parking lot when the teamwas on the road last week.""Somebody's got to do a little better job,"" said Byrd, whoseCadillac Escalade was stolen.Referring to other problems -- including long concession-stand lines and turfdisfigured by the Major League Soccer team that is aco-tenant -- Tony Tavares, the team president, called RFK ""anold dog.""""We've put a lot of lipstick on this pig, but peoplehave fun,"" he said.President Bush and Condoleezza Rice, the secretary of state, were amongthe 110,127 who attended the three-game weekend series and pushedthe season attendance total to 1,166,717, the ninth-highest in theNL.According to Major League Baseball, sales of merchandise bearing the Nationals'brand are among the top five of the league's 30teams, even though the merchandise was introduced after the Christmasseason, the peak period for such sales. With a newstadium expected to open in 2008 and a location inthe prestigious market of the nation's capital, the franchise couldbe sold for as much as $400 million.Despite legal problems that limit their television exposure, a scattered andinconsistent radio network, a low payroll and few star players,the Nationals are outdrawing the Baltimore Orioles, their American Leagueneighbors, who are about 40 miles away.The Nationals are averaging 32,409 fans a game, the ninth-most inthe NL. The Orioles, despite spending most of the seasonin first place in the AL East, are averaging 30,756,down from 33,165 at the same point last season, whentheir team was not as successful.Monica Pence, the communications manager of the Orioles, said it wastoo early to judge the impact of competition in overlappingmarkets. ""We feel we've already said all we wanted tosay,"" she said. ""We expressed concern the Nationals would havea negative impact on our revenue and attendance.""The Nationals have already surpassed the single-season attendance record of theold Washington Senators, who drew 1,027,216 fans in 1946. Theycould threaten the Expos' best attendance of 2,320,651 in 1983.Last season, the Expos drew 748,587.The Nationals' interleague games against Toronto this season were vestiges ofthe teams' geographic rivalry, developed when both were based inCanada. The Expos' transfer was approved late last fall, andthe schedule was already made. Next season, the Nationals andthe Orioles will play each other in their respective parks.But, even with the Nationals in first place, skeptics wonder whetherMLB will be able to sell the team quickly, havea new stadium built with public money and maintain twoviable teams in the region. How will the commissioner's officehandle the finances this summer if the Nationals want tomake trades to compete for a postseason spot?Bob DuPuy, the president and chief operating officer of MLB andthe overseer of the Nationals, said the commissioner, Bud Selig,hoped to have a ""firmer feel"" about the sale ofthe team before the All-Star Game break, in about twoweeks.""You're never convinced a stadium is a sure thing until theythrow the first pitch of the first game,"" DuPuy said.""We've said all along there's room for two teams inthat marketplace.""The Nationals' payroll of less than $50 million is among thelowest 25 percent in the majors, according to Tavares. DuPuysaid, ""I would expect they will have"" more money tospend because a profit of $20 million is projected thisseason.Jim Bowden, the general manager of the Nationals, was more emphatic.""There's no question that if the right deal is outthere, we'll be able to increase payroll to get thepiece to win,"" he said.He added: ""This is a great defensive team, one of thebest defensive teams in the league, and one of thebest bullpens. And when you have pitching and defense, youusually win pennants. We have that combination, and we aregetting the breaks.""Bowden said Nick Johnson, the first baseman and cleanup hitter, ""ishaving his breakout year,"" with 8 home runs, 42 RBIand a .320 batting average. He said Ryan Church, whoinjured his shoulder Wednesday when he crashed into a wallwhile making a game-ending catch in Pittsburgh, was a contenderfor rookie of the year; he is batting .325.Chad Cordero, who leads the majors in saves with 25, said:""We like to be under the radar, but I thinka lot of people are noticing now. They're taking usseriously.""(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)Robinson, a Hall of Fame player who was baseball's first blackmanager 30 years ago in Cleveland, is a serious man.He will turn 70 on Aug. 31, and his patienceis short with many people, including pitchers who disagree withhis maneuvers. Tomo Ohka was one who objected, and hewas traded for doing it.""I can rub the players the wrong way,"" Robinson said. Buthe has helped the team win by arguing successfully withumpires for a reversal of an opponent's home run andby challenging the pine tar on the glove of anopposing pitcher, as he did with Brendan Donnelly of theLos Angeles Angels two weeks ago.When Angels manager Mike Scioscia confronted Robinson over Donnelly's ejection, Robinsonchallenged Scioscia, who is 23 years younger. ""I wasn't goingto let him intimidate me,"" Robinson told reporters a dayafter the incident. ""I am the intimidator.""The managers' confrontation prompted Guillen to rush to Robinson's support inwhat almost escalated into a fight. Since then, Guillen hasbroken out of a slump. He twice hit two homersin a game last week, and he gave the Nationalsa 2-1 lead in the third inning Sunday by divinghome headfirst on an infield grounder.""Jose is a very emotional kid,"" Robinson said. ""That may havegot his adrenaline flowing a little more."" Guillen leads theteam in home runs with 15 and is batting .301.In nine major league seasons, he has played for seventeams, often leaving behind hard feelings.""He's been given a bad rap,"" said Bowden, who traded forhim. ""The guy's a winner. He's emotional.""Now, like his new franchise, Guillen seems to have ceased hiswandering and landed in a comfort zone. The Nationals havethe best home-field winning percentage in the majors, .722.Guillen, referring to the pie-in-the-face celebration, said: ""Winning is always fun.You always try to do something to make the playershappy. Trust me, this happens only when you win andyou have the year we're having. So far, so good.""
It took 33 years for baseball to return to Washington; Nationalsfans hope it will not take that long for mostof them to see the team's cable TV games.Nearly halfway through the season, the Nationals' games on the Mid-AtlanticSports Network, or MASN, are not being carried by Comcastand are seen only by consumers served by RCN Cableand DirecTV.The dispute is almost identical to the one that kept theYES Network off Cablevision's systems in the New York metropolitanarea from 2002 to early 2003. Games are being blackedout in a large portion of the market. One side(Comcast) is suing the other. And one party (the BaltimoreOrioles) has embarked on an advertising campaign to trump itsrival.But there are twists that make the Nationals' case more complex.The Nationals are pawns in events they had no say in,that as the wards of Major League Baseball they couldnot influence. The Nationals' television predicament is a result ofthe compensation package that kept Peter Angelos, the Orioles' owner,from suing to block the Montreal Expos' move to Washington.One part of the agreement gave him 90 percent ownership of(a stake that will be reduced to 67 percent, 1percent a year for the next 23 years), with baseballowning the rest (or selling it to whoever buys theNationals). will not carry Orioles games until 2007, but itbegan showing the Nationals in April.So here is a network mostly owned by one team, carryingthe games of a second team it did not wantin its market, but doing so as part of asweetheart deal under which baseball will also guarantee the valueof the Orioles if Angelos sells.Now that is Moneyball. A total of 81 Nationals games willbe on local broadcast stations this season and 76 onMASN. For their troubles, the Nationals are guaranteed about $20million in annual rights fees from MASN, not bad foran innocent bystander in a legal war.As happy as the deal might have made Angelos, it displeasedComcast, which, in addition to being the largest cable operatorin the United States and the dominant one in theOrioles and the Nationals' market, owns all or part ofvarious entertainment and sports networks, including four Comcast SportsNets. Oneof those sports networks has the rights to carry Oriolesgames through the 2006 season.Comcast has refused to carry and alleged in a lawsuit filedin county circuit court in Maryland that the Orioles' dealwith baseball violated its rights to match third-party offers forthe team's cable rights beyond 2006.""Comcast is trying to protect its monopoly,"" said Bob Whitelaw, theexecutive vice president and general manager of MASN. ""It's thatsimple. They're the only regional network in the area, andthey've stated publicly that a market with 6.6 million cablehouseholds doesn't need another regional sports network.""It is odd, he said, that Comcast started the second regionalsports network in Chicago, and is an investor and theoperating partner in the Mets' new network, which will startnext year and be the fourth one in the NewYork market. The Orioles went on the offensive earlier thismonth. In a filing with the Federal Communications Commission, theyaccused Comcast of violating cable law by showing preference toComcast SportsNet by not carrying a competitor.The Orioles also charged that Comcast illegally sought equity in tocarry it and intimidated rival cable companies into not makingdeals with it.The Orioles insist that Comcast's right to match competing offers hasnot been violated, because no outside bids were made, orsolicited, for the cable games.The team's reasoning stems from the mid-1990s, when Angelos created TCR,a television company that sold Orioles cable rights to HomeTeam Sports, which Comcast eventually acquired knowing that after the2006 season, those rights would revert to the Orioles, whichcould do as they pleased with them.The Orioles argue that is the fruit of forward legal thinking:that it is not a new network, but a successorto TCR, with a new brand name. And, if isnot new, but a reinforced TV company into which baseballis investing $75 million, then Comcast's right to match anoutside bid was not set off.It is elegant thinking, and maybe, in Comcast's view, a fancysubterfuge around the definition of a new network. A Comcastspokeswoman declined to comment.Comcast's problem with the Orioles is a lengthy legal detour fromthe mostly happy tale of the Nationals, who lead theirdivision with a 44-31 record, and whose cable games havebeen held hostage to the battle between Angelos and Comcast.Fans are frequently irrelevant in these disputes, which come down tomoney. Comcast wants leverage and may view the Nationals asfruit from a poisoned tree, so why carry them? Andif Comcast is as ornery as Cablevision, disenfranchised Nationals fansmay have to wait until next year's opening day tosee their team on local cable.
For years, Washington hungered for a baseball team. Nowit has one, and a winning team at that.But in a city where politics courses through the veins ofthe inhabitants -- where Republicans run the show and theman in the White House is himself a former baseballteam owner -- it was probably too much to expectthe Washington Nationals to usher in a bipartisan era ofpeace, love and understanding.Sure, James Carville, the Democratic political consultant, can be spotted atgames sitting in the same row as Andrew H. CardJr., President Bush's chief of staff. But now that GeorgeSoros, the billionaire liberal philanthropist who spent millions trying todefeat Bush last year, is competing for ownership of theteam against bidders who include the likes of Colin L.Powell, the former secretary of state, and Peter Fitzgerald, aRepublican former senator, the mood on Capitol Hill isn't exactlyMom and apple pie.Some Republicans went so far as to suggest that baseball couldlose its antitrust exemption if it permits Soros, who wouldbe a part-owner with a group of investors headed bya local entrepreneur, to sign on -- a threat thatimmediately drew ridicule in the sports pages and outrage fromDemocrats.By Wednesday, one Republican, Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, had backedaway from that suggestion, saying he never intended any threat.But Davis and other Republicans did not back down fromtheir criticism of Soros who, they took pains to note,has been convicted of insider trading in France (a rulinghe is appealing) and has supported ballot initiatives to legalizemedical marijuana.""We finally got a winning team,"" Davis said. ""Now they're goingto hand it over to a convicted felon who wantsto legalize drugs and who lives in New York andspent 5 million dollars trying to defeat the president? How'she going to get him out to the opening game?C'mon.""As if the feud over team ownership is not enough, theNationals appear to be creating a sartorial quandary for some.Certain Democrats, it seems, are feeling queasy about wearing theteam's signature ""W"" caps, which evoke reminders of a certainformer owner of the Texas Rangers whose middle initial justhappens to be W.
","The Washington Nationals expect 45,000 for their home opener with President Bush throwing the first ceremonial pitch. More than 22,000 season tickets have been sold. Manager Frank Robinson saw the team win its opening home stand tied for first place. The team expects a pre-tax profit of $20M. Eight groups interested in ownership could bid up to $400M. Republicans oppose allowing a group that includes billionaire liberal George Soros to become owners of the Nationals. National's games have limited TV exposure due to legal battles resulting, in part, from the Orioles opposition to the move of the Expos to Washington. ","The Nationals home opener was sold out. Fans were excited to have baseball in Washington again. For subsequent games, although the Nationals were in first place and playing well, they played to two-thirds capacity, with little season-ticket base. Bidders for ownership include George Soros, Colin Powell, and other political figures. Nationals have one of the lowest player payrolls in baseball. RFK Stadium is old and must be shared with soccer team DC United. The pitchers mound is lowered for soccer games and built up again but gives pitchers problems. Legal problems between Comcast and Peter Angelos limit Nationals TV exposure. ","The Washington Nationals enjoyed a very successful beginning to the baseball season. By June, the team was on pace to earn a $22 million profit. The residents were excited, merchandise sales were in the top five, the Nationals outdrew the Orioles, and attendance was the ninth highest. The wily manager and his no-name players led the National League on June 26, despite the low payroll and nonexistent farm system. Significant issues, however, remain; the team has still not been sold, games are not on local cable, and sharing the dated stadium with a major league soccer team creates problems. ","As of 13 April, the Nationals were tied for first in their division. They won their opening home game 5-3 over Arizona before a sold-out stadium and by 11 June had won 10 of 11 games. More than 22,000 season tickets have been sold and the team may make a pre-tax profit of $20 million in its first season. Attendance has been strong. Legal problems have limited their television exposure. Some Washingtonians have protested that money should be spent on new schools, not a stadium. "
D0936,D0936-A,"Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman appointed to the US Supreme Court and a frequent swing vote, has announced her retirement, a court source said Friday.Her retirement, which sets up a long-awaited political battle for a successor and gives President George W. Bush his first chance to select a justice for the high court, was confirmed by a Supreme Court official who requested anonymity.As rival groups geared up for what is likely to be a bitter nomination battle, Bush scheduled a news conference for 11:15 am (1515 GMT) in the White House Rose Garden, his spokesman Scott McClellan said.O'Connor, 75, who is considered a moderate conservative, was appointed to the court by president Ronald Reagan and took her seat in September 1981.Her retirement gives Bush the chance to shape the ideological balance of the court, a fact that could spark a prolonged confirmation battle in the US Senate for a successor, touching on lightning bolt questions such as abortion and the separation of church and state. 
President George W. Bush on Friday said he would nominate a new Supreme Court Justice in a timely manner, and called for a dignified confirmation battle, as rival political camps geared up for battle.Bush made a statement in the White House Rose Garden, shortly after Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced her retirement.""Under the Constitution, I am responsible for nominating a sucessor for Justice O'Connor. I take this responsibility seriously. I will be deliberate and thorough in this process,"" Bush said.""The nation deserves and I will select a Supreme Court Justice that Americans can be proud of,"" Bush said.""The nation also deserves a dignified process of confirmation in the United States Senate, characterised by fair treatment, a fair hearing and a fair vote.""I will chose a nominee in a timely manner so the hearing and the vote can be compelted before the new Supreme Court term begins.""Bush also paid tribute to O'Connor, the first woman to serve on the top US court.""America is proud of Justice O'Connor's distinguished service and I am proud to know her,"" he said.""She has been a discerning and conscientious judge and a public servant of complete integrity.""
Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman appointed to the US Supreme Court and a frequent swing vote, announced her retirement Friday, setting up a fierce political showdown for her seat.The move handed President George W. Bush his first chance to reshape the ideological balance of the court, which has immense influence over the lives of Americans, interprets the constitution and acts as a court of last resort.Minutes after O'Connor's announcement, political leaders and lobby groups fired the first shots in a long brewing battle for the court's political soul.Liberals warned Bush not to name an ""extremist"" while Republicans urged him to pick someone who would apply rather than interpret the constitution -- in other words a strict conservative.""The nation deserves and I will select a Supreme Court justice that Americans can be proud of,"" Bush said.""The nation also deserves a dignified process of confirmation in the United States Senate, characterised by fair treatment, a fair hearing and a fair vote,"" Bush said in a statement delivered in the White House Rose Garden.Bush said he would pick a new justice in a ""timely manner"" but the White House said there would be no announcement before he returns from next week's G8 summit in Scotland.The president was set to pore over profiles of potential Supreme Court picks during the long flight to Europe, his spokesman Scott McClellan said.Justices are not term limited, so presidents have a chance to mould the country for years after they leave the political scene, through their court choices.Bush's chance to remake the court is all the more important because key cases on abortion, assisted suicide and gay rights are looming when justices return from their summer break in October.Democratic activists fear that Bush will replace O'Connor, who cast the key votes in two key abortion rights test cases in 2000, with a 'pro-life' justice.O'Connor, a snowy haired 75-year-old judge and former prosecutor told Bush her retirement would become effective upon the confirmation of a successor.""It has been a great privilege indeed to have served as a member of the Court for 24 terms,"" she wrote in a letter to Bush.""I will leave it with enormous respect for the integrity of the Court and its role under our constitutional structure,"" wrote O'Connor, who was born in Texas and practiced law in the southwestern state of Arizona.Bush and O'Connor spoke in what aides said was an ""emotional"" phone call. With a nod to their shared Texas heritage, Bush said: ""for an old ranching girl, you turned out pretty good,"" according to McClellan.O'Connor was appointed by president Ronald Reagan and took her seat in September 1981.She often sided with more radical conservatives on the court, as when she voted with the majority to stop recounts in Florida after the 2000 election, effectively handing the White House to Bush over Al Gore.Cancer-stricken Chief Justice William Rehnquist had been seen as the most likely justice to retire, but has so far made no announcement on his future.O'Connor's retirement opens the first vacancy on the Supreme Court in 11 years. The last justice appointed was the liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, who was named by president Bill Clinton and he took his seat in August 1994.It leaves Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the sole woman on the nine justice Supreme Court bench.Senator Edward Kennedy, who famously scuppered the confirmation of Ronald Reagan's Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, called on Bush to appoint someone who could be embraced by all Americans.""Justice O'Connor was a mainstream conservative who was confirmed unanimously by the Senate,"" Kennedy said.""President Bush is faced with a decision that affects each and every American.""Republican Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist said: ""America needs judges who are fair, independent, unbiased and committed to equal justice under the law.""The liberal political action committee MoveOn.org swiftly rolled out a television advertising campaign. ""The message: Don't nominate an extremist who will undermine the rights of individuals and families as the President did in the Terri Schiavo case several months ago,"" MoveOn.org said in a statement, referring to the recent Florida right-to-die controversy.
US Republicans and Democrats geared up Saturday for a major political battle over a successor to Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who has announced her retirement.Her decision, announced Friday, handed President George W. Bush his first chance to reshape the ideological balance of the court, which has immense influence over the lives of Americans, interprets the constitution and acts as a court of last resort.Minutes after O'Connor's announcement, political leaders and lobby groups fired the first shots in a long brewing battle for the court's political soul.Liberals warned Bush not to name an ""extremist"" while Republicans urged him to pick someone who would apply rather than interpret the constitution -- in other words a strict conservative.""The nation deserves and I will select a Supreme Court justice that Americans can be proud of,"" Bush said.""The nation also deserves a dignified process of confirmation in the United States Senate, characterised by fair treatment, a fair hearing and a fair vote,"" Bush said in a statement delivered in the White House Rose Garden.Bush said he would pick a new justice in a ""timely manner"" but the White House said there would be no announcement before he returns from next week's G8 summit in Scotland.The president was set to pore over profiles of potential Supreme Court picks during the long flight to Europe, his spokesman Scott McClellan said.No official announcement has been made. But the most frequently mentioned names include Attorney General Alberto Gonzales as well as federal appeals court judges Michael Luttig, Harvie Wilkinson, John Roberts and former solicitor general Theodore Olson.Justices are not term limited, so presidents have a chance to mould the country for years after they leave the political scene, through their court choices.Bush's chance to remake the court is all the more important because key cases on abortion, assisted suicide and gay rights are looming when justices return from their summer break in October.Democratic activists fear that Bush will replace O'Connor, who cast the key votes in two key abortion rights test cases in 2000, with a 'pro-life' justice.O'Connor, a snowy haired 75-year-old judge and former prosecutor, told Bush her retirement would become effective upon the confirmation of a successor.""It has been a great privilege indeed to have served as a member of the Court for 24 terms,"" she wrote in a letter to Bush.""I will leave it with enormous respect for the integrity of the Court and its role under our constitutional structure,"" wrote O'Connor, who was born in Texas and practiced law in the southwestern state of Arizona.Bush and O'Connor spoke in what aides said was an ""emotional"" phone call. With a nod to their shared Texas heritage, Bush said: ""for an old ranching girl, you turned out pretty good,"" according to McClellan.O'Connor was appointed by president Ronald Reagan and took her seat in September 1981.She often sided with more radical conservatives on the court, as when she voted with the majority to stop recounts in Florida after the 2000 election, effectively handing the White House to Bush over Al Gore.Cancer-stricken Chief Justice William Rehnquist had been seen as the most likely justice to retire, but has so far made no announcement on his future.O'Connor's retirement opens the first vacancy on the Supreme Court in 11 years. The last justice appointed was the liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, who was named by president Bill Clinton and he took his seat in August 1994.It leaves Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the sole woman on the nine justice Supreme Court bench.Senator Edward Kennedy called on Bush to appoint someone who could be embraced by all Americans.""President Bush is faced with a decision that affects each and every American,"" warned the Massachusetts Democrat.Republican Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist said: ""America needs judges who are fair, independent, unbiased and committed to equal justice under the law.""
The perennial battle over abortion rights in the United States is galvanizing conservative and liberal activists, who are hoping to influence President George W. Bush's choice to fill a newly-vacated US Supreme Court seat.For decades, a deep ideological rift over a woman's right to end an unwanted pregnancy has cleaved this country into two powerful, and equally-impassioned camps.Conservatives, who turned out in record numbers to cast votes last November for the Republican president, see in the retirement of moderate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor a historic chance to reshape the nine-member high court, and fulfill a fervent wish to overturn the watershed Roe v. Wade Supreme Court case which guaranteed women the right to an abortion.Liberals, meanwhile, have sternly warned Bush not to name an ""extremist"" to the court and have vowed to put up a fierce fight to safeguard the right to legal abortion.With a Supreme Court seat now open for the first time in more than a decade, groups on both sides of the bitter abortion divide have said they are planning to spend millions to lobby Congress and the White House, and to rally their supporters. Political observers predicted Armaggedon once the fight to replace O'Connor is joined in earnest, with dozens of political groups expected to play a role.""I think we're in for a pretty partisan battle,"" said Orrin Hatch, a conservative US senator and longserving member of the powerful Senate Judiciary committee that will vet US President George W. Bush's eventual Supreme Court nominee.The debate also is expect to further polarize an already-divided US Senate which will be called upon to confirm the president's pick.""He said he's going to pick a strong conservative, and I think that's going to cause a battle no matter what,"" Hatch told ABC television Tuesday.Even before O'Connor announced her departure, the conservative Progress for America group last month launched a 700,000-dollar fundraising effort, hoping to beat back ""liberal attack groups ... hungry to smear almost any potential candidate for the Supreme Court who doesn't meet their left-wing, extemist litmus test.""Likewise, the Family Research Council said on its website that it is ""primed for the fight it will take to confirm a nominee,"" and vowed to mobilize 20,000 churches across the nation to lobby for a conservative justice.Liberal groups were equally motivated: The pro-choice Feminist Majority sounded the alarm within hours of O'Connor announcing her retirement.""This is it! The worst has happened with the resignation of Sandra Day OConnor,"" the group said on its website.""Let there be no mistake about it: Sandra Day OConnor was the fifth vote that was saving Roe vs. Wade,"" the group said in a dire warning to its supporters. ""Abortion rights and womens rights are on the line.""Another liberal group, MoveOn.org said on its website that it aimed to deliver 300,000 petition signatures by Tuesday to the US Senate, asking lawmakers to help preserve the right to end a pregnancy.And the left-leaning ""Ms."" magazine this month warned its readers that ""rolling back reproductive rights is only the first act in a nightmare scenario that could come to pass if right-wing judges take over the federal courts and the nations highest court.""Bush said in a newspaper interview published Tuesday that he expected to have a new justice on the bench by October, and already had identified ""a good-sized"" number of prospects.The US president called on partisan groups to tone down the heated rhetoric, insisting in an interview USA Today that he is immune to the high-intensity lobbying.""I feel no pressure, except the pressure to put somebody on the bench who will bring dignity to the office, somebody who's got the intellect necessary to do the job, somebody of great integrity and somebody who will faithfully interpret the Constitution,"" Bush said.
US President George W. Bush on Wednesday chastised critics of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales as a potential candidate for the recently-vacated seat in the Supreme Court.""I don't like it when a friend gets criticized. I'm loyal to my friends,"" the US leader said of Gonzales during a brief stop in Denmark on Wednesday before attending the G8 summit in Scotland.  Republicans and Democrats are geared up for a major political fight over a successor to Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who announced her retirement last Friday.The vacancy handed Bush his first chance to reshape the ideological balance of the nine-member high court, which has immense influence over the lives of Americans as it interprets the constitution.Liberals warned Bush not to name an ""extremist"" who could undermine women's right to have an abortion, while Republicans have urged him to pick a strict conservative.Speculation has circled around Gonzales, who has been criticized by both liberals and conservatives, especially for his role in the controversial US policy towards terrorist suspects in captivity.""(A)ll of a sudden this fellow, who is a good public servant and a really fine person, is under fire... I don't like it at all,"" Bush told reporters gathered outside Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen's country residence, just north of Copenhagen.The US leader also reiterated that there would be ""no litmus test"" on controversial issues like abortion or gay marriage for nominees to the Supreme Court position.""(A)s I said during both of my campaigns, there will be no litmus test.  I'll pick people who... will strictly interpret the Constitution and not use the bench to legislate from,"" he said.Bush's visit, his first to Denmark but his fifth meeting with Rasmussen since 2002, was seen by commentators as a symbolic gesture thanking Denmark for supporting the war in Iraq, where it has deployed more than 500 troops near the southern city of Basra.
The new Supreme Court justice must be a strong advocate for civil rights, andNAACP members are pressuring lawmakers to make that a priority in the selectionprocess, NAACP officials said at the group's annual conventionSaturday.""We very badly want to support a nominee committed to justice and fair play,""said Julian Bond, chairman of the board of the National Association for theAdvancement of Colored People. ""We don't want to have to oppose a nominee who isopposed to those things. ... We hope to support someone who brings the countrytogether rather than drives the country apart.""Bond's comments came on the opening day of the group's 96th annual convention,where more than 8,000 people are expected to discuss issues such as reparationsfor slavery, renewal of the voting rights act and ways of increasingmembership.The gathering comes as the group works to overcome budget shortfalls and recoverfrom allegations that its former president, Kweisi Mfume, played favorites amongemployees and mismanaged the national staff. It is also fighting aninvestigation by the Internal Revenue Service, which claims that NAACPofficials' strong criticisms of the Bush administration violated the group'snonprofit status.Last month, the Baltimore-based nonprofit selected a new president, Bruce S.Gordon, who will start in the job Aug. 1.On Sunday, a seminar will focus on who will fill the Supreme Court seat thatwill be vacated by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who announced her retirementJuly 1. NAACP members are being urged to contact the White House and theirsenators to influence selection of the nominee, said Hilary Shelton, head of theNAACP's Washington, D.C., branch.""We've educated our members on this,"" Shelton said. ""We've been doing this eversince we knew the chief justice (William Rehnquist) had thyroidcancer.""The convention also will highlight the persistent health disparities betweenblacks and other groups, with panel discussions, free health screenings andfitness sessions planned each day.""African Americans have the worst health outcomes of all groups,"" said EvelynLewis, a physician with Pfizer Inc., a pharmaceutical company, who spoke on apanel Saturday. ""This is a civil rights issue.""The NAACP's health committee is investigating how well hospitals address racialgaps _ particularly by having black physicians on staff _ and it will gradehospitals in a report card to be released next year, said Rupert Richardson, anNAACP board member from Louisiana and chairwoman of the group's national healthcommittee.""This is a problem everywhere,"" Richardson said.NAACP officials also announced that Howard Dean, chair of the DemocraticNational Committee, and Ken Mehlman, chair of the Republican National Committee,will participate in a discussion on political issues on Thursday.___On the Net:
WASHINGTON - President Dwight D. Eisenhower figured Earl Warren would makean ideal chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.Warren, the Republican governor of California, had been a loyal supporterof Eisenhower in the 1952 election. Eisenhower said he choseWarren the next year because of his deliberate style andhis ""middle-of-the-road"" philosophy.Warren turned out to be one of the most liberal justicesin history, leading the court to landmark rulings on civilrights and the separation of church and state. Eisenhower latersaid appointing Warren was ""the biggest damn fool mistake Iever made.""As President Bush searches for someone to succeed Justice Sandra DayO'Connor, who announced her resignation Friday, the experiences with Warrenand many other members of the Supreme Court provide remindersthat justices often don't vote the way presidents expect.Justice Byron White, an appointee of President John Kennedy in 1962,was expected to be a liberal, but often voted conservativelyon personal liberty and law-and-order cases. O'Connor, named to thecourt in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan, was more conservativein her early years but gradually sided more often withthe court's liberals.Justice David Souter, an appointee of the first President Bush in1990, has angered conservative Republicans by often voting with thecourt's liberals.""We thought Justice Souter would vote differently than he turned outto vote,"" said Boyden Gray, White House counsel under formerPresident Bush.He said many presidents have been unhappy with their appointees.""The landscape is littered with crushed expectations,"" Gray said. ""You cannever predict or control (how they'll vote). That's just absolutelya fact a life.""Not enough homeworkSome justices defy expectations because the presidents who chose them didn'tdo enough homework.That was the case with Souter, a state judge in NewHampshire who served briefly as a federal appeals judge beforehis nomination to the Supreme Court. Researchers who looked intohis record found so little that the press dubbed him""the stealth justice.""White House aides ""really didn't know much about him,"" said EddieLazarus, a former clerk for Justice Harry Blackmun and authorof Closed Chambers, an inside look at the court. ""Thatwas their own fault.""It was difficult to assess Souter because he had been afederal judge for less than a year.""Nobody knew what he stood for,"" said Paul Finkelman, a lawprofessor at the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma.The experience has prompted a refrain by many conservatives: ""No moreSouters.""For other vacancies on the court, presidents have nominated former politicianslike Warren and White who have little or no judicialexperience. The presidents assumed the nominees would follow their party'sideology, but it turned out the nominees had different ideas.Mary Cheh, a law professor at George Washington University, said Whitewas a New Deal Democrat who was in favor of""big government and federal programs."" But he surprised many peopleby often voting conservatively on the court.""He was consistent that he thought the court should stay outof the way of the legislature,"" Cheh said.TransformationsOther justices have changed after they got on the court.In her first few years as a justice, O'Connor was knownas the ""Arizona Twin"" because she voted so often withChief Justice William Rehnquist, one of the court's most conservativemembers.Cheh says O'Connor's opinions in the early days were ""very mechanical""and the only issue she was passionate about was states'rights.But the longer she was on the court, ""she became moresensitive to individual rights,"" Cheh said.There was a similar transformation for Blackmun, an appointee of PresidentNixon in 1970.Blackmun was a longtime Republican, so Nixon and his aides figuredhe would be a dependable conservative on the court. Inhis early years, he frequently voted with conservative Chief JusticeWarren Burger.But Blackmun increasingly sided with liberals and authored the 1973 opinionthat is the flashpoint for many conservatives: the Roe vs.Wade decision on abortion rights.Why the transformations?Finkelman, the University of Tulsa professor, said getting a lifetime appointmentto the nation's highest court leaves people free to maketheir own judgments without being bound by a rigid ideology.""Their vantage point is altered,"" he said. ""Having gotten to thepinnacle, the top of the highest mountain, they suddenly discoverthere is no place to strive for. They look atthe world differently.""U.S. Rep. Tom Feeney, R-Oviedo, said it's more common for Republicanappointees to morph into liberals than for Democratic nominees tobecome conservative. He blames it on the culture of Washington.""When you surround yourself by other rich lawyers and liberal policymakers,you tend to grow out of touch with Joe SixPack and Brenda Babysitter out there in the real world,""Feeney said.Lazarus, the former Blackmun clerk, said he agrees there is aseduction, but said it affects nominees who don't come tothe job with a strict ideology.""Once they get on the court, people who are not ideologicalget swept up in the majesty of interpreting the Constitution'sbeautiful but vague promises of due process and equal protection,""he said. ""That tends to draw them to the left.""Ideologues don't morphThe court's most consistent conservatives are Justices Antonin Scalia and ClarenceThomas.They are the darlings of the right and the foes ofthe left because they rarely stray from conservative orthodoxy.Legal analysts say they haven't morphed because they are strict ideologueswho apply their principles to every decision. Many conservative groupsare urging President Bush to nominate someone like Thomas andScalia to be O'Connor's successor.Liberal groups such as People for the American Way are sayingjust the opposite, urging Bush to pick a moderate.But how can either side know what they're getting? How canthey be sure they won't get another Warren - oranother White?Both sides are scouring the records of possible nominees to lookfor clues about how they might vote: judicial opinions, speechesand law review articles.Ralph Neas, president of People for the America Way, said Bush'snominee ""is probably going to be either a judge oran academic with a lengthy record that is faithful tothe record of a Thomas or a Scalia.""Gray, the former White House counsel, said Republicans have learned lessonsfrom the nomination of Souter.""The most important indicator is their track record - what havethey said, what have they written. I think if youhave a candidate who has a known record, that isthe best,"" Gray said.Cheh, the George Washington University law professor, said Bush and hisaides have learned from history and will thoroughly research possiblenominees to make sure they get an ideologue.""The Republicans,"" she said, ""have made this a high art.""
Just when we thought there was no new speculationabout President Bush's pending replacement of Sandra Day O'Connor onthe Supreme Court, along comes a surprise.During the president's politically correct consultation with the bipartisan Senate leadershipthis week, several senators urged that someone be considered whois not already on a lower federal bench, the customarysource of previous appointments. A non-judge! What a concept.The president apparently welcomed the suggestion, although the names being circulatedso far in public all wear black robes or didso in the past. ""Would I be willing to considerpeople who had never been a judge? The answer is:You bet,"" Bush told reporters. He indicated he was alreadydoing so. ""We're considering all kinds of people -- judges,non-judges.""The idea is that a little hands-on political experience, such asO'Connor had in the Arizona state legislature before becoming astate court judge, might help the nominee reach sensible judicialjudgments the country can support.Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, notedthat career lawyers spend too much time with ""footnotes andsemicolons"" and have ""very little contact with people."" Sen. PatrickLeahy, D-Vt., added that he approved of going ""outside thejudicial monastery.""This is not as shocking an idea as it seems atfirst blush. Chief Justice William Rehnquist, for example, was tappedby President Richard Nixon while an assistant attorney general.Legal historians point out that of the 108 justices who haveserved on the Supreme Court, only 48 were actually drawnfrom the ranks of sitting judges. The others have beenpracticing lawyers, attorneys general, Cabinet officers, senators, members of theHouse, governors, solicitors general and law professors.Indeed, the Constitution does not even require high court justices tohave a law degree. It merely says that judges, ""bothof the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their officesduring good behavior.""The court under Chief Justice Earl Warren is an example ofjudicial diversity that has stood the test of time. Thatcourt handed down the landmark Brown vs. Board of Educationruling outlawing school segregation.Although the Brown decision temporarily caused widespread social turmoil and PresidentDwight D. Eisenhower later complained that his decision to nominateWarren was his biggest mistake, the unanimous ruling was graduallyaccepted as the law of the land. Warren was aformer governor and unsuccessful vice presidential candidate and the courtincluded three former U.S. senators. Their background meant ""you hada broader experience,"" Specter observed.Rehnquist's bout with thyroid cancer and sudden, short hospital stay thisweek for a fever have created a spike in speculationthat Bush may have two vacancies to fill before thenew court term begins in October. That would give himan opportunity to name simultaneously both a judge and anon-judge, broadening the public appeal of his choices.This adds a new dimension to the partisan argument about whetherany new justice should reveal his or her ideological leaningsor be judged only on that vague category, ""character.""A non-judge would have a different sort of record than alegal scholar, reflecting political choices made in real life withreal consequences, instead of writings full of abstract philosophical theory.So whose name might join the gossip circus now? Sen. OrrinHatch, R-Utah, former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has openlylusted for a court seat. Although an ultraconservative, he isfair-minded and could be easily confirmed. Alas, he is 71years old, a tad ancient for a lifetime seat thepresident sees as an important part of his historical legacy.There are other sitting senators as well who are not extremistsand could serve honorably with dignity.Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., a moderate and a leader of thebi-partisan ""gang of 14"" that derailed a GOP Senate moveto kill the right to filibuster judicial nominations, might bean acceptable bipartisan compromise. That would also open up aDemocratic seat in a red state that Republicans might recapture.First Lady Laura Bush is publicly plumping for a woman toreplace O'Connor, but gender is not foremost in the mindsof most legal interest groups. Bush says he will considerpicking a female, but he seems more interested in naminga Hispanic male -- perhaps Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. Bushis also getting advice from an unusual quarter, the currentSupreme Court justices. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., saidthat at a recent luncheon, some of the justices saidthey would prefer ""somebody new on the court"" rather thanmore appellate judges who ""sit in their offices and readbriefs.""Despite the importance of the work, it can obviously get boringwithin those marble judicial halls. Not much dancing in theaisles. But a lot of people would figuratively kill toget there anyway.(Marianne Means can be reached at the e-mail address means@hearstdc.com)
Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman ever appointed to the US Supreme Court, said Friday that sheis retiring, giving US president George W. Bush his first opportunity to appoint a justice.""This is to inform you of my decision to retire from my position as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, effective upon the nomination and confirmation of my successor,"" she said in a letter to Bush.O'Connor, 75, did not explain why she was resigning. A Supreme Court spokeswoman said O'Connor needs to spend time with her husband who suffered from Alzheimer's disease.Her resignation, which will result in the first opening on the US Supreme Court in 11 years, will allow Bush to make his first appointment to the nine-member court which makes many vital decisions concerning US society. Experts said the appointment is set to trigger fierce political battle between the Republicans andDemocrats.In a statement confirming O'Connor's resignation, Bush said he will pick her successor in a timely manner so her vacancy can be filled by the time the court resumes work in October.He also promised to ""be deliberate and thorough"" in making the choice and will consult with the Senate which will confirm his nominee.
","Sandra Day O'Connor announced that she was retiring from the Supreme Court effective upon confirmation of her successor. Minutes after the announcement political leaders and lobby groups prepared for the ensuing battle. Liberals did not want an ""extremist"" and Republicans wanted a judge who would apply rather than interpret the Constitution. President Bush's choice of a judge was important because of key cases in abortion, assisted suicide and gay rights. One of the difficulties in nominating a judge is that they do not always vote the way one would assume, given their political affiliation or ideology. ","Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman to serve on the US Supreme Court, is retiring. She gave no reason but a Court spokesman indicated her need to spend more time with her husband who has Alzheimer's. O'Connor, the first woman to serve on the Court was considered a conservative when seated but became more moderate over the years. President Reagan appointed her in 1981. President Bush now has his first opportunity to nominate someone to the high court and promises to do so in a timely manner. Liberals warned against picking an ""extremist"" while Republicans argued for a strict conservative. ","Sandra O'Connor, 75, appointed to the Supreme Court by Reagan in 1981 and first woman on the court, announced her retirement, effective on confirmation of her successor. She will spend time with her Alzheimer's-patient husband. Bush promised to be deliberate, thorough, and timely in choosing a successor; to have no litmus test on abortion or gay marriage; and to pick a strict constitutionist who will not legislate from the bench. This first vacancy in 11 years gives Bush the chance to shape court ideological balance. O'Connor was a frequent swing vote. Bush chastised critics of Alberto Gonzales as a candidate. ","July 1, 2005 Supreme Court Justice O'Connor resigned, effective with the confirmation of her successor. One of only two female justices, she gave no reason. She is 75, has served 24 years, and her husband has Alzheimer's disease. President Bush began a ""deliberate and thorough"" hunt for a replacement. Liberals warned him to avoid an extremist, while conservatives urged him to pick a strict constructionist. Four male federal judges and the Attorney General were mentioned. Abortion is a key question. Many discussed past appointments where a justice surprised the president by making a shift - to the right or left. "
D0936,D0936-B,"US President George W. Bush on Tuesday nominated a 50-year-old conservative judge to the US Supreme Court, a move that could shape the outcome of battles over volatile issues like abortion for decades.""The decisions of the Supreme Court affect the life of every American,"" the president said in a televised address from the White House, with federal appeals court Judge John Roberts at his side.""A nominee to that court must be a person of superb credentials and the highest integrity, a person who will faithfully apply the Constitution and keep our founding promise of equal justice under law. I have found such a person in Judge John Roberts,"" said Bush.With the choice, Bush shrugged off pressure to pick a woman to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a moderate conservative who was the first woman to serve on the court and often cast the deciding vote in controversial decisions.The president urged the divided US Senate, where his Republican party has 55 of 100 seats, to confirm Roberts by the first week of October, when the high court opens a new session.""This confirmation can be done in a timely manner,"" said Bush. ""So I have full confidence that the Senate will rise to the occasion and act promptly on this nomination.""The nomination was Bush's first chance to reshape the ideological balance of the court, which has immense influence over the lives of Americans as the final arbiter of the US Constitution and court of last resort.Because justices serve for life or until they retire, as O'Connor announced she was doing July 1, they regularly decide critical and controversial political and legal issues long after the president who picked them is gone.In one of those cases, O'Connor sided with her conservative colleagues in a majority decision to stop vote recounts in Florida in the 2000 election, effectively handing the White House to Bush over Al Gore.The top Democrat in the Senate, Harry Reid, neither endorsed nor rejected Roberts, but set the stage for tough questioning by saying that the nominee had ""suitable legal credentials"" but required more scrutiny.""The Senate must review Judge Roberts's record to determine if he has a demonstrated commitment to the core American values of freedom, equality and fairness,"" Reid said in a statement.Roberts' last notable decision came only last week when his appeals court overturned a lower court decision that the special military tribunals for suspected terrorists at the Guantanamo detention camp in Cuba were illegal.The decision was a victory for the Bush administration in its handling of the ""war on terrorism"" detainees. But a new appeal is now expected to go to the Supreme Court.Roberts graduated from Harvard Law School in 1979, was a clerk to arch-conservative US Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist, served in president Ronald Reagan's White House, and was a senior federal prosecutor under Bush's father, former president George Bush.O'Connor was appointed by president Ronald Reagan and took her seat in September 1981.O'Connor's retirement opened the first vacancy on the Supreme Court in 11 years. The last justice appointed was the liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, who was named by president Bill Clinton and took his seat in August 1994.It left Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the sole woman on the nine justice Supreme Court bench.Cancer-stricken Chief Justice William Rehnquist had also been seen likely to retire, but he dismissed such talk last week as ""speculation and unfounded rumors"" and pledged to carry out his duties ""as long as my health permits.""The announcement came as Bush's top political strategist, Karl Rove, was under close scrutiny over his possible role in a leak that may have unmasked a CIA agent in July 2003.
President George W. Bush, giving Supreme Court nominee John G. Roberts a WhiteHouse sendoff Wednesday for the Senate confirmation process, voiced confidencehe will get ""a timely hearing, a fair hearing"" on Capitol Hill.Early Wednesday morning, Bush's choice to succeed Sandra Day O'Connor on thebench was all grins as he and the president emerged from a private breakfast tostroll before the cameras down the colonnade to the Oval Office.Pausing for a moment, Bush said conversations with senators the evening beforehad convinced him that ""we're off to a very good start for his nomination"" andpromised Roberts ""all the support that's necessary for the senators to be ableto make up their minds.""Bush ignored questions about whether he would talk to Democratic senators whoworry that Roberts would push the nation's highest court too far to the right onabortion and other polarizing issues.""We discussed how important it is for Judge Roberts to get a fair hearing, atimely hearing and a hearing that will bring great credit to our nation,"" Bushsaid. ""I wish him all the best.""Roberts headed to Capitol Hill for meetings with leaders in the Senate, whichwill decide whether he will replace O'Connor and thus become the first newSupreme Court member in more than a decade.Abortion, indeed, will be a ""hot button"" issue in the confirmation process,former Sen. Fred Thompson, who will shepherd Roberts through the Senateconfirmation process, said Wednesday. Abortion has been legal since a 1973Supreme Court decision, but remains a controversial topic in theU.S.But Thompson also said that lawmakers shouldn't read too much into Roberts'seemingly conflicting legal positions on the issue.""Many of the positions he's taken are positions he took as an advocate ...representing a client,"" Thompson said on NBC television. He noted that Robertshad served as a deputy solicitor general _ a policy advocate _ in the first Bushadministration.In a brief that Roberts filed with the Supreme Court at that time, he said thatthe court decision that legalized abortion _ Roe v. Wade _ ""was wrongly decidedand should be overruled."" But he told senators during his 2003 confirmationhearings for his current appellate court post that the decision was ""the settledlaw of the land."" Appearing on CBS television, Thompson added that ""one shouldnot confuse a position a good lawyer takes in representing a client with his ownpersonal views.""The nine Supreme Court justices serve in their posts for life or until theydecide to retire. Although they are nominated by the president, they must beapproved by the Senate.Bush introduced the 50-year-old Roberts to the nation Tuesday night, calling hima man with ""a good heart"" and a jurist who will ""strictly apply the Constitutionin laws _ not legislate from the bench.""Reaction from Republican senators was overwhelmingly supportive.Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee called for confirmation proceedings that""treat Judge Roberts with dignity and respect"" and lead to a yes or no votebefore the court's term begins Oct 3.Democrats reacted more cautiously, but there were no instant predictions of afilibuster.""The president has chosen someone with suitable legal credentials, but that isnot the end of our inquiry,"" Senate Democratic leader Harry Reidsaid.Roberts is a Washington insider who has worked over the years at the WhiteHouse, Justice Department and in private practice.After graduating with honors from Harvard Law School, he clerked for William H.Rehnquist when he was an associate justice on the Supreme Court. It wasRehnquist who presided over the swearing-in ceremony when Roberts took his seaton the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.""Before I became a judge, my law practice consisted largely of arguing casesbefore the court,"" said Roberts, who met with the president in the executiveresidence for an hour last Friday. ""I always got a lump in my throat whenever Iwalked up those marble steps to argue a case before the court, and I don't thinkit was just from the nerves.""He was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of ColumbiaCircuit in 1992 by the first President George Bush and again by the president in2001. The nominations died in the Senate both times. He was renominated inJanuary 2003 and was confirmed by voice vote. At the time, his nomination to theappellate court attracted support from both sides of the ideologicalspectrum.
Just after learning that President Bush planned tonominate federal appeals court Judge John G. Roberts Jr. for a seat onthe Supreme Court, NARAL Pro-Choice America sent an electronic actionalert to its 800,000-person network, encouraging members to call theirsenators and talk to friends about their opposition.The abortion rights group also sent out 30,000 e-mails to itsactivists around the country Tuesday night, outlining talking pointsexplaining its opposition to Roberts, and furnishing sample letters tobe sent to local newspapers and background on the nominee. The groupplanned to follow that up Wednesday with calls to its 27 nationalaffiliates, keeping them abreast of any new information that emergesabout Roberts' record.Conservative interest groups, meanwhile, voiced strong support forRoberts and began their campaign to support the nominee long before hewas announced. Hours before Bush's announcement, Progress for Americastaff members were working in the 20th Street studios at InterfaceMedia, preparing a biographical ad supporting the nomination that willbe ready to air on cable television within 24 to 48 hours.``We understand the crucial importance of defining the nomineebefore the opposition has a chance to,'' said Jessica Boulanger, thegroup's director of communications, who said the group is prepared tospend $18 million or more. ``The amount we spend will be dictated byhow much the left puts into fighting the nominee.''Groups on both sides have spent years preparing for this moment.Their legal experts have been poring over the records of close to 20potential nominees, and organizers have spent countless hours inplanning meetings and on conference calls to hone their message. Also,they have amassed huge war chests to finance television, radio andprint ads to define the nominee in the public's mind.In recent years, both sides have clashed over some of Bush'schoices for federal appeals courts, some of which were blocked bySenate Democrats. But activists on both sides called those minorskirmishes when compared with the battle they anticipate over thefirst Supreme Court nomination in 11 years.Raising the stakes is that with the retirement of Justice SandraDay O'Connor, who has been a crucial swing vote on the court, manyliberal activists fear -- and conservatives hope -- that Roberts'sconfirmation would move the court decidedly to the right.``We're saddened that President Bush has chosen the politics ofconflict and division over bipartisan consensus,'' said WadeHenderson, executive director of the Leadership Conference on CivilRights.Officials at People for the American Way held conference calls withallies throughout the day, as speculation swirled about Bush's choice.After Bush's announcement, the liberal activist group activated a planassembled years ago to mobilize opposition to the nominee.The group zipped e-mails to 400,000 members asking them to contacttheir senators, to scrutinize the nominee and, at minimum, not to takea position until after hearings are held.The Federalist Society, in turn, put together a list ofconservative legal experts to advise the media on Roberts and theissues he will face.``The experts are former Supreme Court clerks or otherwise havespecial expertise. ... We believe the experts can help contribute toand enlighten the public discussion,'' the organization's Web sitesaid. The public relations firm Creative Response Concepts, which isworking with a number of conservative organizations active in theSupreme Court fight, is handling contacts between the experts andreporters.Jan LaRue, chief counsel to Concerned Women for America, said theconservative group is prepared to gear up a grass-roots campaign insupport of Roberts if Democrats threaten to filibuster. ``Everything Iknow tells me he meets the president's criteria very well; he clearlyis in the mold of (Antonin) Scalia and (Clarence) Thomas'' -- bothconservative justices.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor offered a quick and pithyreaction to President Bush's nomination of federal appellate judgeJohn Roberts Jr. as her successor on the Supreme Court. ``That'sfabulous,'' she told the Spokane (Wash.) Spokesman-Review after a dayof fly fishing. ``He's good in every way, except he's not a woman.''O'Connor's reaction reflects the view of just one person, but assomeone who gained a reputation for having an intuitive sense ofpublic attitudes and mores during her two decades on the court, shespotlighted the obvious trade-off involved in Bush's decision and mayhave given voice to the conflicted feelings of many Americans -- womenand minorities in particular -- to the Roberts selection.Given the opportunity to maintain some modicum of gender balance onthe court, or even make history by appointing the first Latinojustice, as many Hispanics had openly advocated, the presidentselected a white male to fill the O'Connor vacancy. In doing so, hewas following the precedent of most other presidents: in the historyof the Supreme Court, only four of more than 130 nominees -- JusticesO'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Clarence Thomas and former JusticeThurgood Marshall -- were not white men.Whether that presents a serious problem for a president who hasmade the expansion of the Republican Party's coalition central to hispolitical and governing strategy was a matter of debate Wednesday. Butthere was widespread agreement that the selection of Roberts will putmore pressure on Bush to name a woman or minority to the court shouldanother vacancy occur during his presidency.``I think it raises the stakes significantly for the next one,whoever that might be,'' Democratic strategist Anita Dunn said. ``Ithink right now there's disappointment. If there were another vacancy(filled by a white male), there would be anger.''Hispanic leaders were most vocal. ``We're disappointed, to say theleast,'' Hector Flores, national president of the League of UnitedLatin American Citizens, said while attending the National Council ofLa Raza convention in Philadelphia. Flores had lobbied hard on behalfof Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.Manuel Mirabal, president of the National Puerto Rican Coalition,attending the same convention, agreed, saying there might be politicalconsequences for Republicans who hoped to cut deeper into theDemocrats' 60 percent share of the Hispanic vote in the lastpresidential election.Others questioned how much longer-term fallout Bush faces, and evensome Democrats pointed to the fact that he has put together diverseCabinets in both terms and has put women in positions of power in theWhite House and elsewhere.But the failure to fill the O'Connor seat with a woman or minoritywasn't lost on Bush's allies Wednesday as they sought to rally behindRoberts while addressing the deficiency on the diversity front.``Some people have asked me, well, didn't you want a woman? Well,yes, of course I did,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas. ``Ofcourse I think diversity is important on the Supreme Court. I wouldlike to see another woman. I would like to see a Hispanic American onthe Supreme Court. But I believe first and foremost what we want isthe very best person. And, for this time, the president has chosenJohn Roberts.''Sen. Ken Salazar, D-Colo., released a letter addressed to thepresident lamenting what he said was a missed opportunity to assurethe inclusion of women at all levels of government. ``You and I bothhave two daughters,'' Salazar wrote. ``The profound message we shouldbe giving to them is that their gender creates no limitations for themto live up to their God-given potential. Yet, I fear that with theloss of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor from the United States SupremeCourt, we are sending the opposite message.''Hispanic leaders might have been more vocal in their disappointmentwere it not for the fact that many worried that Bush would appoint aconservative Latino whose views conflict with their own agendas. ``Mygreatest fear was that President Bush would choose someone who willnot be sensitive to our demands,'' and that fear has not abated, saidCesar Perales, president of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense andEducation Fund.Gonzales was viewed by Hispanics as a Republican centrist, the bestthey could hope for among the available candidates, according toRudolph de la Garza, a Columbia University political science professorwho specializes in Latino politics, and other experts said. Butsupporting him outright would have been awkward, since human rightsgroups with whom they are allied opposed Gonzales for his role inhelping to provide legal authority that led to the torture ofprisoners in Iraq.Democratic strategist Jim Jordan said that by failing to appoint awoman or Latino, Bush had ``highlighted a negative stereotype of theparty -- a party that truly only welcomes conservative white males.That's an unflattering view of the party and one frankly we thoughtthey were trying to ameliorate.''But Republican National Committee spokesman Brian Jones said thecommittee's vigorous outreach to minorities would continue. ``I don'tthink this is something that's going to derail the efforts underway atthis point,'' he said.Republicans said Wednesday they are confident the O'Connor vacancywill not be the last Bush will be asked to fill, given the health ofChief Justice William Rehnquist. But the Spokane paper reported thatO'Connor said she doubted the president would name a woman as chiefjustice. ``So that almost assures,'' she said, ``there won't be awoman appointed to the court at this time.''Research editor Lucy Shackelford contributed to this report.
Sandra Day O'Connor's retirement from the Supreme Court should makeus ponder affirmative action. Her most influential piece of writingmight well be the 2003 court opinion allowing the University ofMichigan Law School to continue race-based admissions for the timebeing -- so long as there were no racial quotas. It was the first timethe court had ever endorsed race-based university admissions.And of course, O'Connor herself was the first woman on the SupremeCourt. When President Reagan nominated her in 1981, affirmative actionwas fairly new; O'Connor made it look good. She was superblyqualified, yet presumably would have been overlooked had Reagan notsearched expressly for a female.But that was long ago. Today, affirmative action is ripe for thejunkyard. There's dramatic evidence in President Bush nominating agarden-variety white male to O'Connor's seat. He said somethingimportant by doing so. Consider the fact that for much of the 20thcentury, the ``Jewish seat'' was a Supreme Court convention. To haveone Jew on the court (no more, no less) seemed proper and fitting. Butin time Jews went mainstream and the single ``Jewish seat'' quietlydisappeared. (There are now two Jewish justices).Bush has delivered a comparable message to women and minorities:Welcome to the mainstream! We don't need a ``woman's seat'' on thecourt. There are no more outsiders in American life.Now let's get rid of affirmative action.In practice, affirmative action means cheating in a good cause.(But all cheating, for any cause, gnaws at a nation's moral innardslike termites.) Affirmative action means a plus factor in universityadmissions, job hiring and promotion for candidates from protectedgroups, in the interests of ``diversity.'' (But why should``diversity'' mean official ``minorities'' and women but notlibertarians, farmers, Mormons, Texans, children of soldiers, aspiringCatholic priests, etc.?)Affirmative action is highly unpopular: A 2003 WashingtonPost-Harvard-Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 92 percent ofthe public (86 percent of blacks) agreed that admissions, hiring andpromotion decisions ``should be based strictly on merit andqualifications other than race/ethnicity.'' Only bureaucrats andintellectuals (species that are more closely related than they seem)love affirmative action.Is it really ``cheating''? In 2003, Linda Chavez, the head of theCenter for Equal Opportunity, described University of Michiganfreshman admissions as they stood in the mid-1990s: ``We found thatthe odds ratio favoring admission of a black applicant with identicalgrades and test scores to a white applicant was 174 to 1.'' TheSupreme Court struck down that admissions procedure, but it's afrightening reminder of what people can do in the name of fairness.Affirmative actions begs comparison with the Vietnam War: twohugely ambitious programs with no exit strategies. In 1965, theJohnson administration launched affirmative action. The Nixonadministration relaunched it in 1970, requiring all federalcontractors to set ``goals and timetables'' to govern black hiring. Itspread quickly (as a legal requirement or voluntary policy) to unions,government agencies, big business, universities.It was intended originally not to create diversity but to stamp outprejudice in a hurry. As such, it bears another strange resemblance toVietnam. You could argue in both cases that we won but refused toadmit it. Some modern historians insist that we defeated theVietnamese communists, then walked off and let them win by default.And we have stamped out so much prejudice that nowadays we are atleast as strongly bigoted in favor of women and minorities as we arebigoted against them -- as any 10-year-old can tell you.Textbooks widely used in public schools consistently downplay whitemen in favor of women and minorities. (Thomas Edison gets less spacethan a black scientist who tweaked one of Edison's inventions. ANavajo physicist gets a detailed write-up, but Albert Einstein doesn'tappear. A biologist of the Seneca tribe is credited with nothingnoteworthy, but he gets a picture while James Watson and FrancisCrick, co-founders of modern genetics, don't rate a mention. Atvirtually any U.S. university, female or minority faculty candidatesare in vastly greater demand than white males.Affirmative action has turned the United States into anaristocracy. British aristocrats have enjoyed their own kind of``reverse discrimination'' for a thousand years. America'saffirmative-action aristocrats were only created a generation ago;until then, they were targets of bigotry themselves. So what? Noaristocracy is acceptable in the United States.O'Connor wrote in the University of Michigan ruling thataffirmative action must end some day. George W. might be just the manto end it.
In his four-and-a-half-year presidency, George Bush has rarely goneagainst his conservative instincts and the fundamental interests of hispolitical base. Tuesday night he stayed true to form, nominatinga conservative favorite, appellate court Judge John Roberts, to theU.S. Supreme Court.Filling the first court vacancy in 11 years -- the crucialswing vote held by a retiring Sandra Day O'Connor --Bush was handed a grand opportunity to make a lastingmark on the closely divided court. He responded by pickinga judge who has been espousing conservative judicial dogma formore than two decades.Although he has been a judge for only two years, Roberts,50, has an extensive written record on behalf of Republicanadministrations, notably on the volatile issue of abortion. ""We continueto believe that Roe was wrongly decided and should beoverruled,"" Roberts wrote in a 1991 Supreme Court brief asdeputy solicitor general.Despite what will be an intense fight, though, there were earlyhints that Roberts was headed for likely confirmation. Notably, Bushpassed over several candidates who would have made conservative groupseven happier. And Democrats Tuesday night were reacting with markedcaution, not fiery condemnation. Roberts will be no red-meat targetfor opponents.The president made his pick with gusto, making a rare prime-timeannouncement in a bid to galvanize a nationwide television audience.""I believe that Democrats and Republicans alike will see the strongqualifications of this fine judge, as they did when theyconfirmed him by unanimous consent to the judicial seat henow holds,"" Bush said at the White House.In the process, Bush touched off what is likely to bea spirited and expensive fight in the U.S. Senate overRoberts' confirmation. Tens of millions of dollars have been squirreledaway in anticipation of a classic Supreme Court battle, andRoberts' appointment makes it likely that much of it willbe spent.In the weeks leading up to Tuesday's pick, a few prognosticatorsthought Bush might try to head off this battle andoffer a consensus appointment that would be in the O'Connormold. But Tuesday night he made it clear that hispick would be a change agent.""He will strictly apply the Constitution and laws -- not legislatefrom the bench,"" Bush said.As presidents have learned time and again, it's never safe toassume the judicial leanings of a Supreme Court justice newlyarmed with a lifetime appointment. But odds are strong thatRoberts would align himself with Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas andChief Justice William Rehnquist to form a rock-solid conservative corethat would need only a single extra vote to makenew law -- a far different alignment from the onethat's existed for the last decade.As a clerk for Rehnquist, then as a lawyer in theadministrations of Ronald Reagan and Bush's father, Roberts repeatedly provedhis conservative mettle, persuading legions of Republican heavyweights of hisjudicial orientation. He also won political points during Bush's contested2000 victory over Democrat Al Gore, working behind the sceneson Bush's successful case before the Supreme Court.But given his short stint as appellate judge in the Districtof Columbia circuit, White House officials contend Roberts will bea tough target for opponents to shoot at, with athin paper trail of rulings. Beyond that, Roberts will bebuoyed by his reputation as a legal dynamo who hasargued 39 cases before the Supreme Court and whose intellectualweight makes him a high court natural.Crucial to whether Roberts' nomination results into a historic free-for-all isthe reaction of 14 moderate senators who stepped in earlierthis year to defuse a bitter Senate fight over Bushappeals court nominees. If some of the seven Democrats inthat group signal that Roberts is acceptable, the Senate battlecould cool.In an early indication, one of the Democrats, Sen. Joe Liebermanof Connecticut, told reporters last week that Roberts would be""in the ballpark,"" making a Senate filibuster against him unlikely.But holding off the well-funded machines that have been established tosupport, and oppose, any Bush nomination will be a tallorder -- particularly on the issue of abortion.As deputy solicitor general in 1991, Roberts was co-author of anadministration brief that said clinics receiving federal money should beprevented from discussing abortion with their patients. As part ofthat brief, which was ultimately endorsed by the court, Robertswrote that the Supreme Court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion ""findsno support in the text, structure, or history of theConstitution.""Supporters will argue that Roberts' brief represented the position of hisclient, the first Bush administration, and not his own view.Nevertheless, the abortion issue will hang heavily over his confirmationproceedings. So will the reality that his appointment could dramaticallyalter the court's course on issues ranging from religious expressionto affirmative action.Bush got plenty of advice over how he could make hismark in his first Supreme Court nomination. His wife urgedhim to appoint a woman. Minority groups suggested he appointthe court's first Latino.But the president had his own agenda. Notwithstanding the Iraq war,his first-term tax cuts and his Social Security plan, changingthe fundamental balance of power on the Supreme Court couldbe the president's biggest legacy. And early indications are thatRoberts, a young man who could serve on the courtfor decades, will put him on course toward that goal.
The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July20:The American people know little about Judge John Roberts Jr., otherthan that President Bush is nominating him to fill SandraDay O'Connor's seat on the Supreme Court. But in thecoming weeks that should change. The Senate has a dutyto scrutinize his background and question him closely at hisconfirmation hearings about substantive areas of the law. If heis a mainstream conservative, in the tradition of Justice O'Connor,he should be confirmed. But if on closer inspection heturns out to be an extreme ideologue with an agendaof stripping away important rights, he should not be.Roberts is a member of the District of Columbia U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals, and before that he was a lawyerin the administrations of President Ronald Reagan and the firstPresident George Bush. Compared with many of the possible nomineeswhose names have been circulating, he has a thin recordon controversial subjects. This may have helped him win thenomination because it gives the other side so little towork with. But it also puts a greater burden onthe Senate to determine what kind of a judge hewould be.One of the most important areas for the Senate to exploreis Roberts' views on federalism -- the issue of howmuch power the federal government should have. The far rightis on a drive to resurrect ancient, and discredited, states'rights theories. If extremists take control of the Supreme Court,we will end up with an America in which thefederal government is powerless to protect against air pollution, unsafeworking conditions and child labor. There are reasons to beconcerned about Roberts on this score. He dissented in anEndangered Species Act case in a way that suggested hemight hold an array of environmental laws, and other importantfederal protections, to be unconstitutional.There are also serious questions about Roberts' attitude toward abortion rights.As a lawyer in the first President Bush's administration, hehelped write a brief that argued that Roe v. Wadeshould be overturned.Bush did the country a service by making his nomination earlyenough for the Senate to have ample time to investigatethe judge's record and hold hearings. The leaders in bothparties should resist any pressures to move quickly. It wouldbe irresponsible to take a position on the nomination ofRoberts until his background is carefully reviewed, and until senatorshave a chance to question him at length. The nominationof a new Supreme Court justice is a great momentfor the nation, providing new vigor to a great Americaninstitution. The entire country has a stake in the outcome.
Ed Gillespie, the White House commando in charge ofthe selling of Judge John G. Roberts for a seaton the highest court in the land, was settled intohis temporary West Wing office on Friday with a readyarmy and almost no enemy to fight.Some war room: the telephones were silent, Fox News was unwatchedin a corner, no aides bustled in and out. WithCongress gone for another sultry weekend, it was just Gillespieand his sidekick, Steve Schmidt, a top adviser to VicePresident Dick Cheney who is moonlighting as the communications directorin the Roberts sales campaign.What do the two do all day?""There are meetings punctuated by brief periods of nonmeetings,"" said Gillespie,who has temporarily vacated his office in his lucrative downtownlobbying firm, Quinn Gillespie & Associates. Gillespie, the former RepublicanNational Committee chairman who attacked Sen. John Kerry as awaffler in the 2004 presidential campaign, appeared in relative reposein a wing chair. Schmidt parked himself on Gillespie's emptydesk.The much-anticipated mother of all Supreme Court battles had yet tobe joined. Roberts had not sparked the kind of partisanuproar that others might have, which would have turned thecapital upside down for the rest of the summer. Butit has not yet been a week since President Bush'snomination of Roberts, and whether the relative calm of themoment is a function of the judge's personality or becausethe hearings are such a long way off is notclear.Still, both sides are poised for a fight, with millions ofdollars ready to be spent. Groups on the left havebeen sending millions of e-mails messages questioning Roberts' position onabortion, and Democrats were already preparing their topics for hisexpected grilling before the Senate Judiciary Committee in September.""He's seen as a nice, open Midwestern fellow,"" said Sen. CharlesE. Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the committee. ""But ifhe refuses to answer any questions or give any furtherinformation about himself, that view could change.""In other words, three days after Bush nominated Roberts to replacethe retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, it was still along way to the opening of the court on Oct.3, which is when Bush has said he wants tohave his nominee in place. Gillespie, the White House's favoritepit bull in the 2004 campaign, and Schmidt, a formerBush campaign spokesman, knew the relative calm was unlikely tolast.But he said: ""Despite the predictions and the anticipation that thingsare different now, that it's not going to be likeBreyer and Kennedy and Ginsburg and Souter, the fact is,it's a lot like Breyer and Kennedy and Ginsburg andSouter. The fundamentals have not changed.""Gillespie was referring to the relatively calm confirmation hearings of JusticesStephen G. Breyer, Anthony M. Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg andDavid H. Souter.
SOME DOCUMENTS OF COURT CHOICE TO BE RELEASED (This article ispart of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed version ofa story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.)BRODER WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration plans to release documentsfrom Judge John G. Roberts' tenure in the White Housecounsel's office in the mid-1980s and his earlier job workingfor the attorney general, but will not make public paperscovering the four years he spent as principal deputy solicitorgeneral starting in 1989, two senior administration officials said Monday.The decision fulfilled a request for disclosure of the documents madeon Monday by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., the chairman ofthe Judiciary Committee, which will hold the confirmation hearings forRoberts, President Bush's choice to fill the Supreme Court seatbeing vacated by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, said the senator'sspokesman, Bill Reynolds.But it falls short of the disclosure sought by Democrats, whohave been demanding access to files from the nominee's workin the solicitor general's office at the Justice Department from1989 to 1993, under the first President George Bush. Democratssay those files could shed light on the nominee's thinkingabout a variety of issues that could come before thecourt, and are especially important because Roberts has not producedmuch of a paper trail when it comes to issueslike abortion. Specter did not seek access to the papersfrom Roberts' work as deputy solicitor general, Reynolds said.The officials said the administration had decided to waive any claimto attorney-client privilege from those documents because the papers arecovered by the Presidential Records Act, the law that governsthe disposition of presidential papers.One of the officials, both of whom sought anonymity to speakcandidly about a decision that had not yet been madepublic, said the White House had reviewed some of thepapers from Roberts' work in the counsel's office and sawnothing in them that could create problems for his confirmation.But the officials said the administration felt it would be wrongto release the papers from Judge Roberts' work as theNo. 2 person in the solicitor general's office under KennethW. Starr. Those papers, which are not covered by thePresidential Records Act, record ""sensitive, deliberative, confidential"" conversations among administrationlawyers in developing legal cases for argument before the SupremeCourt and therefore should not be released publicly, one ofthe officials said.On Sunday, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., the ranking Democrat onthe Judiciary Committee, said lawyer-client privilege did not apply eitherto Roberts' work at the Justice Department or to hiswork at the White House.Specter and Leahy met Monday to discuss the timing of theconfirmation hearings, but still have no agreement, although they appearto be close to reaching agreement.
Ending speculations and debates, US President George W. Bush finally announced Tuesday hischoice for the vacancy in the Supreme Court left by retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.In a live broadcast TV statement Tuesday night, Bush announced that John G. Roberts Jr., an appeals court judge and a conservative, is his first nominee for the Supreme Court.Praising Roberts ""has a good heart"", Bush said the 50-year-old native of Buffalo, New York State, has been devoting himself to the ""cause of justice"" throughout his life.Roberts, who stood aside when the president was making the announcement, said later that he will fulfill his duty and serve the nation and justice.Analysts said Bush's choice for the Supreme Court seat will enhance the government's influence in the nine-seat highest court where a balance had been kept between four conservatives and four liberals while the outgoing O'Connor stood in the middle.In his early years, Roberts had served as a clerk for Chief Justice William Rehnquist before he worked in Republican administrations.He joined the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in May 2003 and has proved his conservative stance when he and two other appeals court judges ruled that war crime trials in the prison at the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, could proceed.The US Supreme Court consists of nine judges, including a ChiefJustice and eight Justices. The highest judicial body holds the ultimate judicial power and can veto any legislation passed by theCongress or any state.Members of the court can keep their posts for life if they are willing to do so under the condition of no malfeasance.O'Connor, the only female member of the court, announced on July 1 that she decided to retire, leaving weeks of speculations and debates on who will be Bush's nominee for the court.
","After learning President Bush planned to nominate Judge John G. Roberts for a seat on the Supreme Court Abortions Rights Groups directed their members to call their senators to express opposition. Conservative activist groups voiced strong support for Roberts. There were early hints that Roberts would likely be confirmed. For one, Bush had passed over candidates who would have made conservative groups happier. Bushed urged the divided US Senate to confirm Roberts by early October. Republican reaction to the nominee was overwhelmingly supportive, but Democrats reacted more cautiously and with reservations, admitting that Roberts had suitable legal credentials. ","President Bush nominated a conservative favorite, appellate court judge John Roberts, to the US Supreme Court to replace O'Connor. In doing so he resisted pressure to name a woman or Hispanic. O'Connor was a crucial swing vote on the court. Liberals fear and conservatives hope that Roberts' s confirmation will move the court decidedly to the right O'Connor said of Roberts: ""He's good in every way, except he's not a woman"". Pro-choice activists indicated opposition to Roberts who, as a lawyer in the first Bush Administration, helped write a brief that argued Roe v. Wade should be overturned. ","Bush nominated conservative federal appeals court Judge John G. Roberts, 50, to replace Sandra O'Connor. Liberals and abortion rights supporters immediately mobilized their opposition. Conservatives began their campaign to support Roberts before he was announced. Both sides have spent years preparing for this, poring over records of potential nominees and amassing war chests. Roberts has been a judge for only two years but was considered fair. Roberts has argued that Roe vs. Wade was wrongly decided and ruled that special military tribunals at Guantanamo Bay could proceed. Roberts was expected to be confirmed. Bush passed over even more conservative candidates. ","On July 19, Bush named John G. Roberts, Jr. to replace Justice O'Connor. Roberts graduated from Harvard Law School, clerked for Chief Justice Rehnquist, and worked in two Republican administrations. He has been a judge on the federal appeals court for one year, creating no record on controversial subjects such as abortion and federalism. The release of some documents from his White House service is expected. Many regret that he is a white male, as were all but four of past nominees. Although liberals and conservatives are ready for a fight in the Senate, intense acrimony is not expected. "
D0937,D0937-A,"The man accidentally shot by US Vice President Dick Cheney while the two were hunting on a southern Texas ranch is in stable condition, a hospital spokeswoman said Monday. Harry Whittington, 78, was peppered with shotgun pellets after Cheney turned to shoot quail that had just been flushed out of the brush, Cheney spokeswoman Lea Anne McBride confirmed Sunday.""He remains in stable condition in our ICU (intensive care unit),"" Michele Mora-Trevino, a spokeswoman for Christus Spohn Hospital Memorial in Corpus Christi, Texas told AFP.""The area affected was his shoulder, upper body, chest and some of the neck area,"" she said.""It was like a spraying. It wasn't a direct hit.""Whittington was admitted at 8:15 pm on Saturday following the accident and remained in the intensive care unit on Monday morning.""He's in good health, he's doing well,"" Mora-Trevino said, adding that a release date had not yet been set for the prominent Texas lawyer.
The White House drew fire Monday for not immediately disclosing that Vice President Dick Cheney had shot a 78-year-old hunting partner in a weekend incident not reported until a day after it took place.There was still no official account of the events on Katherine Armstrong's south-Texas ranch on Saturday, when Cheney missed his quail quarry but hit prominent lawyer Harry Whittington in the neck and chest with birdshot.And Bush spokesman Scott McClellan battled criticism over the decision by Cheney's office to let Armstrong -- a private citizen with no official White House role -- make the news public by informing her local newspaper.""I think you can always look back at these issues and look at how to do a better job,"" mused McClellan, who said he had advocated full disclosure and left little doubt that he would have handled the situation differently.Bush knew an hour after the fact that a hunting accident had taken place at 5:30 pm (2330 GMT), and it took him another 30 minutes to find out that Cheney had pulled the trigger, said McClellan.Breaking with precedent, the White House did not disclose the information to the national media that cover Bush and Cheney. The news first came to light on Sunday at 1:48 pm (1948 GMT), when the Corpus Christi Caller-Times published Armstrong's account on its Internet site.Cheney and Armstrong ""agreed that she should make that information public.  She was an eyewitness, she saw what occurred and she called her local paper to provide those facts,"" said McClellan.Whittington was in stable condition in the intensive care unit at Christus Spohn Hospital Memorial, were he was treated for wounds to his shoulder, upper body, chest and neck, said hospital spokeswoman Michele Mora-Trevino.Cheney aides continued to decline requests for an official timeline and details of the incident, pointing reporters to Armstrong's account and vouching for its accuracy.McClellan as well as Cheney spokeswoman Lea Anne McBride insisted that the time gap between the incident and its confirmation by the White House was due to a focus on getting Whittington the medical care he needed.McClellan also said that details about the shooting were trickling in throughout the night and that the White House needed ""to get the facts together.""""It was an accident. Unfortunately, these types of hunting accidents do happen from time to time,"" the spokesman told a frequently contentious briefing with reporters.Asked why getting Whittington medical attention was incompatible with releasing details of the incident, McClellan said that the vice president's office had ""worked to get that information out.""But the Caller-Times reported Monday that McBride, after confirming the incident around noon (1800 GMT) on Sunday, had refused to say whether the vice president's office would have disclosed the incident if the daily had not contacted her after getting a tip from an unnamed Armstrong family member.""I'm not going to speculate,"" the daily quoted her as saying. ""When you put the call into me, I was able to confirm that account.""Armstrong has said that Whittington came up noiselessly behind the vice president, who spun around to target a bird and shot his fellow hunter instead.The incident made the front pages of The Washington Post, The New York Times, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal, most of which noted soberly that Cheney's office had not gone public with the information when it happened.Late-night talk show hosts, who typically mine such incidents for laughs, were not broadcasting over the weekend, making Monday night the first time they will be able to train their sights on the mishap.
US Vice President Dick Cheney did not have a legal permit to hunt quail when he accidentally shot a 78-year old hunting partner over the weekend, the White House said on Monday.The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department informed Cheney that he lacked a stamp for hunting ""upland game birds"" in the state when the shooting incident occurred, the vice president's office said in a statement.Texas authorities said they would issue a warning citation to Cheney but impose no penalty or fine for failing to have the seven-dollar stamp.The revelation was sure to aggravate a public relations headache for the White House, already under criticism for waiting a day to disclose the shooting incident.Cheney shot prominent lawyer Harry Whittington in the neck and chest with birdshot on Saturday as the two were out quail hunting on a Texas ranch.Whittington's condition was improving and described as ""stable"" by doctors at Christus Spohn Hospital Memorial, where he was treated for wounds to his shoulder, upper body, chest and neck.News of the shooting was first revealed not by the White House but by the owner of the south-Texas ranch, Katharine Armstrong, where the incident took place. Armstrong spoke to the local newspaper, the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, which had called her after getting a tip.President George W. Bush's spokesman Scott McClellan as well as Cheney spokeswoman Lea Anne McBride insisted that the delay between the incident and its confirmation by the White House was due to a focus on securing Whittington medical care.McClellan also said that details about the shooting were trickling in throughout the night and that the White House needed ""to get the facts together.""""It was an accident. Unfortunately, these types of hunting accidents do happen from time to time,"" the spokesman told a frequently contentious briefing with reporters.Asked why getting Whittington medical attention was incompatible with releasing details of the incident, McClellan said that the vice president's office had ""worked to get that information out.""But the Caller-Times reported Monday that McBride, after confirming the incident around noon (1800 GMT) on Sunday, had refused to say whether the vice president's office would have disclosed the incident if the daily had not contacted her after getting a tip from an unnamed Armstrong family member.""I'm not going to speculate,"" the daily quoted her as saying.Confirming Armstrong's account, local police and state game officials said the vice president had spun around to target a bird and shot his fellow hunter instead.""The investigation reveals that there was no alcohol, or misconduct involved in the incident,"" the Kenedy County sheriff's office said in a statement.An interview with Whittington had confirmed Cheney's account, the sheriff's office said.The Caller-Times also reported Monday that the US ambassador to Switzerland and Liechtenstein, Pamela Willeford, was part of the hunting party.An incident report by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department said that Whittington had gone to retrieve a downed bird when Cheney wheeled around with his 28-gauge Perazzi shotgun and shot him by accident.The weather was sunny and ""clear"" when the accident occurred and both men were wearing blaze orange hats and vests, the report said.The Dallas Morning News reported that Whittington also lacked the proper stamp for hunting quail. Gaming officials said they had been issuing oral warnings instead of fines to hunters who had failed to update their licenses under the new rule.Cheney's staff members had asked state authorities for all necessary permits beforehand and were never informed about the need for a seven-dollar stamp for quail hunting, his office said in its statement.While awaiting a warning from game wardens, ""the Vice President has sent a 7 dollar check to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, which is the cost of an upland game bird stamp,"" it said.The incident made the front pages of The Washington Post, The New York Times, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal, most of which noted soberly that Cheney's office had not gone public with the information when it happened.Late-night talk show hosts, who typically mine such incidents for laughs, were not broadcasting over the weekend, making Monday night the first time they will be able to train their sights on the mishap.
Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally shot and wounded a companion during aweekend quail hunting trip in Texas, spraying the fellow hunter in the face andchest with shotgun pellets.Harry Whittington, a millionaire attorney from Austin, was ""alert and doingfine"" in a Corpus Christi hospital Sunday, a day after he was shot by Cheney ona ranch in south Texas, said Katharine Armstrong, the property'sowner.He was described as in stable condition by Yvonne Wheeler, spokeswoman for theChristus Spohn Health System in Corpus Christi.Armstrong in an interview with The Associated Press said Whittington, 78, wasmostly injured on his right side, with the pellets hitting his cheek, neck andchest during the incident which occurred late afternoon on SaturdayShe said emergency personnel traveling with Cheney tended to Whittington untilthe ambulance arrived.Cheney's spokeswoman, Lea Anne McBride, said the vice president was withWhittington and his wife at the hospital on Sunday.The shooting was first reported by the Corpus Christi Caller-Times. The vicepresident's office did not disclose the accident until nearly 24 hours after ithappened.Armstrong said she was watching from a car while Cheney, Whittington and anotherhunter got out of the vehicle to shoot at a covey of quail.Whittington shot a bird and went to look for it in the tall grass, while Cheneyand the third hunter walked to another spot and discovered a secondcovey.Whittington ""came up from behind the vice president and the other hunter anddidn't signal them or indicate to them or announce himself,"" Armstrongsaid.""The vice president didn't see him,"" she continued. ""The covey flushed and thevice president picked out a bird and was following it and shot. And by god,Harry was in the line of fire and got peppered pretty good.""Whittington has been a private practice attorney in Austin since 1950 and haslong been active in Texas Republican politics. He has been appointed to severalstate boards, including when then-Gov. George W. Bush named him to the TexasFuneral Service Commission.Whittington owns property in Travis County, which includes the state capitalAustin, worth at least $11 million, the Austin American-Statesman reported lastyear, not counting a downtown block at the center of a long-running dispute withthe city over a condemnation issue.Armstrong, owner of the Armstrong Ranch where the accident occurred, saidWhittington was bleeding and Cheney was very apologetic.""It broke the skin,"" she said of the shotgun pellets. ""It knocked him silly. Buthe was fine. He was talking. His eyes were open. It didn't get in his eyes oranything like that.""""Fortunately, the vice president has got a lot of medical people around him andso they were right there and probably more cautious than we would have been,""she said. ""The vice president has got an ambulance on call, so the ambulancecame.""Cheney is an avid hunter who makes annual hunting trips to South Dakota to huntpheasants. He also travels frequently to Arkansas to hunt ducks.Armstrong said Cheney is a longtime friend who comes to the ranch to hunt aboutonce a year and is ""a very safe sportsman."" She said Whittington is a regular,too, but she thought it was the first time the two men huntedtogether.""This is something that happens from time to time. You now, I've been pepperedpretty well myself,"" said Armstrong.___Associated Press writer Paul Weber in Dallas contributed to thisreport.
Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally sprayed acompanion with birdshot while hunting quail on a private Texas ranch,injuring the man in the face, neck and chest, the vice president'soffice confirmed yesterday after a Texas newspaper reported theincident.The shooting occurred late Saturday afternoon while Cheney washunting with Harry Whittington, 78, a prominent Austin lawyer, on theArmstrong Ranch in south Texas. Hearing a covey of birds, Cheney shotat one, not realizing that Whittington had startled the quail and thathe was in the line of fire.Whittington was treated on the scene by Cheney's traveling medicaldetail before being taken by helicopter to a Corpus Christi hospital.He was in the intensive care unit at Christus Spohn Health System andlisted in stable condition yesterday evening.Katharine Armstrong, the ranch's owner, saw what happened Saturdayand told reporters Sunday that Cheney was using a 28-gauge shotgun,which shoots fewer pellets and has a smaller shot pattern than a12-gauge shotgun, making hitting the target more challenging.Whittington was about 30 yards away when he was hit in the cheek, neckand chest, she said.PICK UP 5th graf: According to Armstrong's xxx
Although he broke no laws, Vice PresidentDick Cheney did not have proper hunting credentials when heaccidentally shot a fellow hunter at a private ranch last weekend,authorities said Monday.Cheney, an experienced outdoorsman who had a valid out-of-statehunting license, will receive a warning citation for failing topurchase the required $7 stamp for bird hunting, the Texas Departmentof Parks and Wildlife said in a statement. The stamp is a newrequirement, and the department has issued verbal warnings to manyhunters who were unaware they needed it.In a statement Monday night, Cheney's office said his staffers hadnot known about the stamp requirement and that Cheney had sent a $7check to Texas to cover the cost.The accident occurred Saturday when the vice president wheeled toshoot at a covey of quail and accidentally sprayed his huntingpartner, 78-year-old attorney Harry Whittington, with bird shot,authorities said. Whittington was moved out of the intensive care unitat a hospital here Monday and reported to be in good spirits.``This was a hunting accident,'' said Gilbert San Miguel, chiefdeputy of the Kenedy County Sheriff's office. ``There was no alcoholor misconduct.''But the incident has reverberated worldwide: ``Cheney bags alawyer,'' was the headline in the Glasgow, Scotland-based Herald.And it has forced a White House already under fire for secrecy toexplain why it made no mention of the shooting until the ranch ownerdisclosed it to a local newspaper, 18 hours after the incident.White House press secretary Scott McClellan said Monday that the``first priority was making sure that Harry Whittington ... wasgetting the medical care that he needed. And I think that's whereeverybody's attention should have been focused, and was focused, whenthe hunting accident took place.''Still, McClellan blamed Whittington for the accident, noting thatthe attorney left the hunt line to retrieve a downed quail and wasapproaching Cheney from behind. ``The protocol was not followed by Mr.Whittington when it came to notifying the others that he was there,''McClellan said. ``And so, you know, unfortunately these type ofhunting accidents happen from time to time.''But hunting experts said that, although Whittington should havemade his location clear, the vice president is also to blame for notkeeping track of his companions.``You're hunting together -- you need to know where everyone is,''said Larry Keane, general counsel of the National Shooting SportsFoundation.Said Jeff Hart, an Austin lawyer who hunts for quail in Texas: ``Ifyou pull the trigger, you're responsible for it, no matter what. ...In hunting, the shooter is responsible for knowing where the shot isgoing. That's the bottom line.''Cheney, well-known for having testy relations with the media, onMonday came under criticism from Democrats and Republicans who saidthe White House should have disclosed the incident immediately.``It's news, and it reflects an attitude in this White House ofholding back information, of being too clever by half and beingsecretive,'' conservative columnist Robert Novak said on Fox News.``On the face of it, this looks like something the administrationfelt the public had no right to know,'' Joe Lockhart, who wasPresident Clinton's press secretary, said in an interview. ``I don'tthink there's going to be a bunch of people sitting around saying: `Iwonder why they waited to tell us.' But what they will be saying is:`I wonder what else they're not telling us.' ''Whittington -- a prominent Austin attorney -- and the vicepresident arrived for a weekend hunting trip Friday night at the50,000-acre Armstrong ranch, a well-known retreat for wealthy TexasRepublicans 95 miles south of Corpus Christi.The party of 11 hunters set out in two trucks Saturday morning,driving around the mesquite-dotted property and shooting quail untilabout 12:30 p.m., said Anne Armstrong, co-owner of the ranch. Thenthey broke for a lunch of antelope, jicama salad and camp bread,washed down with Dr Pepper.After lunch, the group split up. Cheney, Whittington and PamelaWilleford, a former Texas energy executive who is now the U.S.ambassador to Switzerland, went with two of Armstrong's daughters andpursued quail for several more hours. It was at dusk that Whittingtonshot his bird and went to retrieve it, taking him behind the vicepresident.The medical team that travels with Cheney immediately beganministering to Whittington, who was bleeding profusely from pellets inhis face, neck and chest, according to witnesses. They packed thewounded attorney into Cheney's ambulance and drove him to a nearbyhospital.It was evident that the injuries were not life-threatening,Armstrong said, because the ambulance paused on the road for severalminutes to allow Whittington's wife to join them.After being stabilized at the hospital in Kingsville, Whittingtonwas evacuated by helicopter to a larger facility in Corpus Christi --where he was placed in the intensive care unit. The Secret Servicereported the shooting to the Kenedy County sheriff's office, althoughno one from that agency interviewed Cheney until Sunday morning.When asked whether the Secret Service had prevented him fromtalking to the vice president right after the shooting, San Miguelsaid: ``I'd rather not say.''Anne Armstrong said that on Saturday evening, Cheney spoke with herabout disclosing the incident to the public. ``We knew word would getout,'' she said. The vice president urged her to tell friends andfamily first, before word leaked out to the media.Late Sunday morning, her daughter, Katharine Armstrong, called areporter from the Corpus Christi Caller, which then reported theshooting on its Web site.Peter Binko, administrator of Christos Spohn hospital in CorpusChristi where Whittington was recuperating, said the injured hunterwas cracking jokes -- and was baffled by all the publicity. ``He's atrue Southern gentleman,'' Binko said of Whittington at a Monday newsconference. ``He's really amazed, I think, at all the hoopla overthis.''Whittington is a fixture in Texas politics, having worked inRepublican campaigns dating back to John Tower's senatorial run in the1960s. He's best known nowadays for a decades-long battle to preventthe city of Austin from building a parking lot over a downtown blockthat he owns. The dispute is still being litigated.Riccardi reported from Corpus Christi and Gerstenzang fromWashington.

Globe StaffWASHINGTON - Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally shot a hunting partnerSaturday in Texas, and the White House did not confirmthe shooting until nearly 20 hours later. The victim wasdescribed as being ""peppered pretty good"" with birdshot and wasin stable condition Sunday.Cheney shot Harry Whittington, 78, a multimillionaire Austin lawyer, spraying hisfriend and hunting partner with shotgun pellets from head tochest. He was being treated in the intensive care unitat a Corpus Christi hospital.Whittington, bloodied but still conscious, tumbled to the ground after hewas hit. Cheney thought he was shooting at a coveyof quail, according to an owner of the ranch.Cheney is a longtime hunter and delivered the keynote address in2004 to the National Rifle Association, from which he accepteda rifle as a gift.The accident happened in south Texas at the famed Armstrong Ranch,co-owned by members of a family long close to Cheney.Tobin Armstrong was a major financial backer of the Bush-Cheneyteam who died last October, with Cheney attending the funeral.Anne Armstrong, a former counselor to President Nixon, has servedon the board of the Halliburton Corp., where Cheney waschief executive before becoming vice president.Whittington is a longtime friend of President Bush from their daystogether in Austin when Bush was Texas governor. He wasdescribed in an article published two weeks ago in theAustin-American Statesman as being ""very rich, very stubborn, and verypatient.""The Associated Press quoted Katharine Armstrong, one of the ranch owners,as saying she watched the shooting from her vantage ina nearby car. She said that Whittington shot a quailand went to look for it in the grass. Cheneythen went to search for more quail.Cheney was using a 28-gauge shotgun and was about 30 yardsaway from Whittington, she said. Both men were wearing orangevests.Whittington ""came up from behind the vice president and the otherhunter and didn't signal them or indicate to them orannounce himself,"" Armstrong told the Associated Press. ""The vice presidentdidn't see him. The covey flushed and the vice presidentpicked out a bird and was following it and shot.And, by God, Harry was in the line of fireand got peppered pretty good.""Armstrong said Whittington was injured mostly on his right side, fromcheek to chest.

McBride said Armstrong talked to ""her local paperand when we were asked about the account she hadprovided, [we] confirmed that.""Armstrong did not return a call seeking comment on McBride's statement.After the hospital visit, McBride said Cheney ""was pleased to seethat he was doing fine and in good spirits.""Cheney, who suffered four heart attacks before he was elected vicepresident and has been hospitalized for heart problems while inoffice, always travels with a medical team. His team treatedWhittington before he was taken to the hospital.Bush, who owns a ranch in Texas, and Cheney, who grewup in Wyoming, are both enthusiastic hunters, a fact theyhave frequently mentioned during political campaigns. McBride said Cheney hasa Texas hunting license.Cheney's hunting trips have included one with Supreme Court Justice AntoninScalia, who went duck hunting in January 2004 with thevice president in Louisiana, a trip criticized because Scalia participatesin decisions that affect the administration.Tobin Armstrong was quoted by the Associated Press as saying in2000 that he frequently went hunting on the ranch withCheney, who turned 65 last month.When Armstrong died in October, his funeral was attended by Cheneyand former President George H. W. Bush. ""Tobin is oneof our dearest and most respected friends,"" former President Bushsaid. ""Barbara and I loved Tobin Armstrong.""The 50,000-acre Armstrong Ranch was purchased in 1852 by Tobin Armstrong'sgrandfather, John Armstrong III, who became known for capturing outlawJohn Wesley Hardin, according to a profile of the ranchin the Caller-Times.Whittington has long been active in Republican Party politics and wasappointed by then-Governor George W. Bush to the Texas FuneralService Commission.In the final stages of the 2004 campaign, Cheney mocked theway Democratic presidential nominee Senator John F. Kerry went ona hunting trip.""He wore a brand new camouflage jacket for the occasion, whichmakes you wonder just how often he does really gogoose hunting,"" Cheney said, according to a White House transcript.""My personal opinion was his camo jacket was an Octoberdisguise. ... But, my fellow sportsmen, this coverup isn't goingto work because you and I know the Second Amendmentis more than just another photo opportunity.""The Houston Chronicle has reported that there were 29 hunting-related accidentsin Texas in 2004, with four fatalities.
The White House on Monday carefully distanced itself fromVice President Dick Cheney's delayed notification about his accidental shootingof a hunting companion.White House Press Secretary McClellan said he had privately urged Cheney'sstaff to quickly disclose details about the 5:30 p.m. CSTaccident on Saturday rather than wait for the Texas ranchowner to telephone the local newspaper more than 18 hourslater, on Sunday. McClellan said he was informed late Saturdaynight that there had been a hunting accident but didn'tlearn that Cheney had shot the victim until 6 a.m.EST Sunday.McClellan said President Bush learned there had been a hunting accidentfrom White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card about 7:30p.m. EST Saturday and learned that Cheney had been theshooter shortly before 8 p.m. EST when updated by DeputyWhite House Chief of Staff Karl Rove.Cheney's staff did not publicly confirm the accidental shooting until 3:30p.m. EST on Sunday, more than 20 hours after theaccident, when the Corpus Christi Caller-Times posted a story onits Web site.McClellan said spoke with Katharine Armstrong, one of the ranch ownersand an eyewitness to the accident, and she agreed torelay word of the accident to the local newspaper onSunday.McClellan said he had urged speedy public disclosure following the incidentat the 50,000-acre Armstrong Ranch some 60 miles outside CorpusChristi, Texas.""I think it's always important to get information out as quicklyas possible,"" McClellan said. ""Of course in a position likemine, I was urging that that information be made availableas quickly as possible.""McClellan attributed some of the delay to Cheney's aides trying to""get the facts together (to) provide that information to thepublic"" as well as making sure that Cheney's victim, 78-year-oldTexas lawyer Harry Whittington, had adequate medical attention.But McClellan sought to deflect criticism about the slow disclosure bysuggesting that Cheney's staff was responsible.""It was the vice president's office that took the lead onthis,"" he said, when asked about whether he had beentold that Cheney's staff was relying on a private citizento report the accident.Whittington, an Austin lawyer, was listed Monday in ""very stable"" conditionat Christus Spohn Hospital Memorial in Corpus Christi, Texas, wherehe was undergoing treatment for multiple pellet wounds on theright side of his lower face, neck, shoulder and chest.Hospital administrator Peter Banko said Whittington was moved out ofintensive care on Monday.Cheney, 65, was using a .28 gauge shotgun when he accidentallypeppered Whittington with bird shot at a distance of about30 yards while trying to shoot flushed quail. The CorpusChristi Caller-Times reported Monday that Cheney and Whittington had beenhunting with Pam Willeford, the U.S. ambassador to Switzerland andLiechtenstein who had served for eight years on the TexasHigher Education Coordinating Board.The vice president's office did not publicly report the accident untilmid-afternoon Sunday after the Corpus Christi Caller-Times had asked aboutit.McClellan contrasted the delayed notification by a private citizen with hisown quick actions last July when he notified the newsmedia that Bush had collided with a member of hisScottish security detail while bicycling in Scotland during an internationalsummit.McClellan immediately disclosed that Bush had suffered ""mild to moderate"" scrapeson his arms and hands that required bandages by theWhite House physician.McClellan, drawing a distinction with the response by Cheney's staff, toldreporters Monday: ""I think you can always look back atthese issues and look at how to do a betterjob.""OPTIONAL TRIM -- STORY MAY END HEREMcClellan and the Corpus Christi Caller-Times provided the following timeline:Saturday, Feb. 11:5:30 p.m. CST -- Cheney accidentally shoots Whittington.

The White House sought with little success on Mondayto quell an uproar over why it took the betterpart of a day to disclose that Vice President DickCheney had accidentally wounded a fellow hunter in Texas onSaturday and why even President Bush initially got an incompletereport on the shooting.The victim, Harry Whittington, a 78-year-old lawyer, was transferred from theintensive care unit to a private room in a CorpusChristi hospital on Monday. His condition remained listed as stable,with wounds to his face, neck, chest and rib cagefrom the pellets sprayed at him from 30 yards awayby Cheney's shotgun.Calls to his room were routed to the hospital's marketing department,which said it was taking messages for him. Texas officialssaid on Monday night that Cheney would be issued awarning citation for hunting without a proper game stamp onhis license. The local sheriff said an investigation had concludedthat the episode was ""no more than an accident.""At the White House, Cheney made no statement and remained outof public view on Monday. At the end of ameeting with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Cheney and Bush exchangedremarks that reporters were about to enter the room, andthe vice president left before the journalists arrived.But Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, was battered athis daily news briefing by journalists demanding answers to whyCheney had not been faster to make public what happenedand why he had chosen a local newspaper in Texasas his vehicle for doing so.The pressure came in part from questions about whether Cheney mighthave been trying to play down the incident, a suggestionthat was rejected by those who were with Cheney overthe weekend.Among the people with him at the Armstrong Ranch in southTexas was his host Katharine Armstrong, a lobbyist and longtimefriend of Cheney. Her lobbying clients include several that dobusiness with the federal government, though Armstrong said she didnot believe that she had ever lobbied Cheney.In an interview, Armstrong said that it did not occur toanyone in the hunting party to make news of theshooting public immediately, but that no one, including Cheney, hadcalled for holding it back. She said Cheney participated indiscussions on Sunday morning about disclosing the incident, agreeing thatit should be made public but deferring to the Armstrongfamily on how to do so.On Sunday morning, Armstrong tipped off her local newspaper to thestory. It was later picked up by national wire servicesand confirmed by Cheney's office.The incident provided a wealth of material for Democrats, gun controlactivists and critics of the Bush administration, not to mentionlate night comedians.McClellan struggled at times to explain even the most basic detailsin the case, including when and how Bush was informedabout it.In the end, White House officials said Bush learned about theshooting accident at 7:30 p.m. Eastern time, about an hourafter it happened, in a call from Andrew H. CardJr., his chief of staff. But Bush did not findout that Cheney was the shooter until about half anhour later in a subsequent call from Karl Rove, hissenior adviser and deputy chief of staff, who had calledArmstrong to ask about the incident.The local sheriff, Ramon Salinas 3rd, said the Secret Service calledhim shortly after the shooting occurred.Salinas said he sent his chief deputy, Gilbert Sanmiguel, to theArmstrong ranch that night. He said Sanmiguel interviewed the Cheneyand reported that shooting was an accident.The sheriff said Sunday that they had yet to speak to""the victim."" ""But you could say it's closed,"" Salinas saidof the case.On Monday, a news release from the sheriff's office said that"" Whittington's interview collaborated Vice President Cheney's statement"" and thatthe department was ""fully satisfied that this was no morethan a hunting accident.""There is no requirement to report nonfatal hunting accidents in Texas,said Lydia Saldana, the communications director for the Texas Parksand Wildlife Department.In a statement on Monday night, Cheney's office said a memberof his staff had asked the Parks and Wildlife Departmentfor all of the necessary permits for the vice presidentto go quail hunting in Texas and had paid $140.But, the statement said, the staff member was not informedof the need for an additional stamp, costing $7, toallow hunting of upland game birds.The statement said Cheney has now sent a $7 check tothe department.Cheney has often gone hunting as vice president, sometimes with otherprominent officials, including Justice Antonin Scalia. During the 2004 presidentialcampaign, Cheney mocked Sen. John Kerry, the Democratic nominee, forhaving worn camouflage on a duck-hunting trip, saying Kerry's ""newcamo jacket is an October disguise, an effort he's makingto hide the fact that he votes against gun-owner rightsat every turn.""(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)This past weekend brought Cheney together with a group of oldfriends, friends of friends and political supporters in the kindof private setting he relishes. The guests included Pamela PitzerWilleford, a Texan who was appointed ambassador to Switzerland andLiechtenstein in 2003. She was with Cheney at the timeof the shooting, as was Armstrong, whose mother, Anne, isa prominent Republican supporter and whose family ranch is afamiliar destination for Republican politicians.According to public documents, Armstrong registered in 2004 as a lobbyistfor Parsons, an engineering and construction firm that has doneextensive work in Iraq, and listed the size of thecontract at more than $100,000, according to lobbying records fromthe Texas Ethics Commission provided by Texans for Public Justice,a watchdog group.Armstrong's business partner, Karen Johnson, spent several years lobbying for Parsons,doing work on ""business development"" before the State Department, theDepartment of Transportation and the U.S. Agency for International Development,according to PoliticalMoneyLine, which tracks federal lobbying. Johnson also lobbiesfor major corporations, including Lockheed Martin, and has been oneof Bush's leading fund-raisers.Armstrong has a relatively limited list of lobbying clients in Texasand in Washington. Public records show that she has workedfor Baker Botts, the law firm; Prionics AG, a biotechnologycompany; Trajen, a firm that performs aviation technical support forthe U.S. military; and the King ranch, the property nextto her family's ranch.Records in Texas indicate that she has lobbied at the statelevel for three companies: Avex Group, the Dannenbaum Engineering Corporationand Ecocreto USA.Armstrong played down her role as a lobbyist and suggested thatshe had not brought up business during Cheney's visit. Shewas appointed to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission in1999 by Bush, who was then the Texas governor.""You need to understand that the Cheneys are our friends maybefor a couple of decades, maybe 30 years,"" Armstrong said,adding that she did not personally represent Parsons. ""I representa couple of Texas companies, not a large lobbying practice,""she said.Armstrong said she does more public relations and consulting work thanlobbying, but she declined to disclose her clients. She nonewere involved in Iraq ""that I know of.""Asked if she was concerned that Cheney's visit could create theappearance of impropriety during the lobbying investigation involving Jack Abramoff,which has brought to light the often close personal andprofessional ties between lobbyists and public officials, she said: ""Ohmy God, he's a friend. I don't believe I've everlobbied the vice president, nor would I be comfortable doingso.""(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)According to Armstrong and Willeford, the accident was largely the faultof Whittington, who reappeared alongside two of his hunting companionswithout giving proper warning. Cheney, who was carrying a 28-gaugeshotgun, had already begun to fire and sprayed Whittington.""He got peppered pretty good,"" Armstrong said. ""He fell with hishead toward me."" She said she ran over to Whittington,who had fallen to the ground, but stayed out ofthe way while Secret Service agents tended to him.""There was some bleeding, but it wasn't horrible,"" she said. ""Hewas more bruised.""Willeford, whose husband was also at the ranch, said in aninterview that Whittington accepted responsibility for the accident.""He understands that he could have handled it better,"" Willeford said.""Harry should have let us know he was back there.""Willeford and her husband are substantial Republican donors; they gave morethan $11,000 to Republican causes, including the Bush campaign andthe Republican National Committee, in the 2004 election cycle.
U.S. Vice President Dick Cheneyaccidentally shot and injured a hunting companion in Texas over the weekend, U.S. media reported Sunday.Harry Whittington, Cheney's hunting companion during a quail hunting trip in Texas on Saturday, was mostly injured on his rightside, with shotgun pellets hitting his cheek, neck and chest, the reports said.Whittington, 78, was ""alert and doing fine"" in the hospital, Katharine Armstrong, owner of the Armstrong Ranch in south Texas, was quoted by CNN as saying.Cheney spent time with Whittington, a lawyer from Austin, and his wife at the hospital on Sunday, CNN said.Whittington shot a bird and was looking for it in the tall grass, while Cheney and the third hunter walked to another spot and found a second covey, Armstrong said.She said Cheney didn't see Whittington, and when he chose a bird to shoot, he accidentally hit Whittington, who was ""in the inthe line of fire.""Whittington was bleeding, but he was not very seriously injured,she said.Cheney was very apologetic, she added.
","Vice President Dick Cheney did not have a valid hunting license when he shot Harry Whittington in February 2006.

The incident was first reported by the Corpus Christi Caller-Times. Cheney's office disclosed the accident 20 hours after it occurred. White House staff was criticized for the delay. The incident provided a wealth of material for Democrats, gun control activists and late night comedians. ","On a Texas ranch on February 11, 2006, Vice President Cheney accidentally shot a hunting companion, Harry Whittington, 78. Whittington, peppered on the right side, received emergency care and then was flown to a Corpus Christi hospital. He was moved from the intensive care unit on February 13. Eyewitnesses said the shooting was Whittington's fault. Although the White House was notified within hours, the news was not made public until nearly 20 hours, when, with Cheney's permission, the ranch hostess alerted the local press. The timing and manner of notification drew sharp criticism from observers and the White House. "
D0937,D0937-B," Democrats in Congress on Tuesday accused Vice President Dick Cheney of a pattern of secrecy, and demanded that he ""level"" with the public, after keeping mum about accidentally shooting an associate over the weekend.Cheney has been criticized for waiting a day before disclosing a hunting mishap Saturday in which he shot his 78-year-old hunting companion, Harry Whittington, in the neck, chest, and face.Asked at a press conference for her reaction about how the White House has handled the incident, US Senator Hillary Clinton called the Bush administration's failure to be more forthcoming ""troubling.""""A tendency of this administration -- from the top all the way to the bottom -- is to withhold information ... to refuse to be forthcoming about information that is of significance and relevance to the jobs that all of you do, and the interests of the American people,"" Clinton said.""Putting it all together, going back years now, there's a pattern and it's a pattern that should be troubling,"" she said at a press conference calling for a more robust federal response to the Hurricane Katrina disaster.The former first lady continued: ""The refusal of this administration to level with the American people on matters large and small is very disturbing, because it goes counter to the way our constitutional democracy ... is supposed to work.""Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid at a press conference Tuesday said the secretive tendency goes beyond Cheney, pervading the entire Bush the White House.""I think the reason it took the vice president a day to talk about this is part of the secretive nature of this administration,"" the top Senate Democrat said. ""They keep things pretty close to the chest.""""I think it's time the American people heard from the vice president, in a real meeting just like we're having here,"" said Reid, who called the George W. Bush presidency ""the most secretive administration in modern history.""""In the last many, many decades, there's no administration more secretive than this,"" he said.Cheney has not commented publicly about the accident, which took place on the 50,000-acre Armstrong Ranch in Texas on Saturday, although he issued a statement Tuesday saying that his ""thoughts and prayers"" were with his friend, and that he stood ready to help Whittington in any way.""The vice president said that his thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Whittington and his family,"" the statement said. Allegations that he is obsessively secretive have dogged Cheney since the early days of the Bush presidency, including his refusal during the administration's first term to reveal the participants on energy task force he led.The vice president also has been criticized for a possible role in helping craft the administration's controversial secret domestic wiretapping policy.Meanwhile, his chief of staff, Scooter Libby, has been implicated in secretly leaking the name of a CIA officer to discredit her husband -- an action some recent news accounts suggest may have been sanctioned by Cheney.Senator Chuck Schumer said Tuesday the time has come for the vice president to hold a press conference -- which Schumer said would be Cheney's first in some four years -- to clear the air.""In light of the recent shooting accident and all the questions surrounding his role in the leaking of classified national security information through his Chief of Staff Lewis Libby, there are many questions that Americans have for VP Cheney,"" Schumer said in a press release.
US Vice President Dick Cheney continued to keep a low profile Wednesday as his shooting of a hunting partner over the weekend and the White House's handling of the incident mushroomed into a political controversy.Cheney -- who has yet to express regret publicly for wounding 78-year-old Texas lawyer Harry Whittington in the neck, chest and face -- called him in his hospital room Tuesday to offer help and best wishes, the vice president's office said.Doctors blamed birdshot that shifted to Whittington's heart for a mild heart attack he suffered Tuesday, and said that while his life was not in immediate danger, and no surgery was needed to remove the lodged metal, he would have to stay in hospital another week.Whittington has developed an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation, which can lead to the formation of blood clots that can cause a stroke if they move to the brain. Cheney managed to duck a battalion of reporters staking out a meeting he had with lawmakers Tuesday, and White House aides said he had no plans to come forward with his account of the incident.Amid criticism of the White House for waiting to announce the shooting accident for nearly 21 hours, two former Republican presidential press secretaries said Cheney should have reported the incident to the public without delay.""It could have and should have been handled differently,"" Ari Fleischer, President George W. Bush's first spokesman from 2001 to 2003, told the magazine Editor and Publisher.Marlin Fitzwater, who served as press secretary to Bush's father and to late former president Ronald Reagan, told the same publication he was ""appalled"" at how the administration had handled the incident.The vice president's office said that his first public event would be on Friday, in Cheyenne, Wyoming -- but that he was not likely to explain how a quail hunt on the Texas ranch of Katharine Armstrong on Saturday nearly turned tragic.Cheney's office has refused to provide an official account of the hunting incident, pointing reporters to Armstrong -- a private citizen with no formal ties to the White House.President Bush's current chief spokesman, Scott McClellan, served notice that there would be no official, formal White House account of how the incident occurred, even as he signalled impatience with questions about it.""You all can spend your time on it. We're going to keep focusing on the pressing priorities of the American people, like talking about how to make health care more affordable and accessible,"" said the spokesman.McClellan, who learned of Whittington's heart attack just before his main daily briefing, declined to be drawn by questions about the nearly 21-hour gap between the incident and when it was made public, or why the news came from the ranch owner rather than official channels.""What happened has been explained,"" he insisted.Democratic Senator Hillary Clinton called Cheney's handling of the situation ""troubling"" and said ""a tendency of this administration, from the top all the way to the bottom, is to withhold information.""While Cheney's Republican allies accused the US media of overreacting, the mood grew somber after doctors at Christus Spohn Hospital Memorial in Corpus Christi, Texas, reported the heart attack.Hospital spokesman Peter Banko said Whittington would have to stay in their care for seven more days ""to make sure no more birdshot moves into vital organs, as well as that piece of birdshot doesn't move anywhere else in the heart.""Dozens of pieces of birdshot -- tiny pellets about 5 millimeters in diameter -- remain lodged in Whittington's body.Cheney, who visited Whittington in the hospital on Sunday, telephoned him Tuesday afternoon to offer his help and tell him that ""his thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Whittington and his family,"" the vice president's office said in a statement.""Mr. Whittington's spirits were good, but obviously his situation deserves the careful monitoring that his doctors are providing,"" it said.
Harry M. Whittington, the 78-year-old hunteraccidentally shot by Vice President Dick Cheney, was back in intensivecare Tuesday after suffering a mild heart attack, as questionscontinued to swirl around the White House's handling of the incident.Doctors treating Whittington said a shotgun pellet that lodged inhis chest had triggered what they described as a ``silent heartattack.'' He was reported in stable condition at the Corpus Christi,Texas, hospital where he has been treated since the shooting onSaturday.Cheney, who has yet to comment publicly on the shooting, was quotedin a statement from his office as saying that he had spoken withWhittington after learning of his condition and that ``his thoughtsand prayers are with'' the Austin, Texas, attorney.Doctors who briefed reporters at an afternoon news conferenceoutside Christus Spohn Hospital Corpus Christi-Memorial said thatWhittington did not experience chest pains or other classic symptomsof a heart attack. They said the pellet, which they decided to leavein place, had caused inflammation of the heart muscle that caused atemporary blockage of blood flow.David Blanchard, chief of emergency medicine at the hospital, saiddoctors were ``very, very optimistic'' that Whittington would make afull recovery.Still, the heart attack revealed that Cheney's misfire, firstregarded as more embarrassing than life-threatening, had potentiallyput his victim's health in greater danger, after doctors and WhiteHouse officials initially had described Whittington as on the mendfrom minor injuries.It also derailed a concerted White House effort to move past thehunting episode, which has tarnished Cheney's image and highlightedhis penchant for secrecy, while thrusting Bush's top aides, includingpress secretary Scott McClellan, into a tug-of-war with the media.Cheney's office -- under blistering attack for failing to make apublic announcement about the shooting -- reversed course and issued adetailed statement about his concern for Whittington.It recounted a phone call Cheney made to Whittington after learningof his condition, in which the vice president wished him well ``andasked if there was anything he needed,'' the statement said. Cheney``said that he stood ready to assist,'' it added.Doctors said Whittington was expected to remain at the hospital fora week for treatment and observation.Doctors in Washington, whom Blanchard described as White Housephysicians, have been consulting with cardiologists at Christus Spohnon Whittington's care, Blanchard said. He said they had agreed that itwould be in the elderly patient's best interests to treat him with``medical therapy,'' rather than surgery.The vice president learned of the change in Whittington's conditionTuesday morning, and watched part of the televised hospital newsconference, the statement from his office said. After that briefing,the release added, Cheney placed a call to Whittington.Even as the White House struggled for a second straight day todefend its handling of the shooting, McClellan continued to withholdcertain details. He was informed of Whittington's heart troublesbefore his televised briefing and before the Corpus Christi newsconference in which they were disclosed, but he did not mention thedevelopments during the 27-minute exchange, which was dominated byquestions about the hunting accident.``You're welcome to continue to focus on these issues,'' McClellantold reporters. ``I'm moving on.''McClellan later said he did not reveal the change in Whittington'scondition because ``it's not appropriate for me to'' do so. ``I'm nothis doctor; that's for his doctor to talk about.'' He also said therewere ``privacy issues'' preventing him from commenting on the matter.As the focus turned to Whittington's health, new details continuedto emerge about what took place on the 50,000-acre southeast Texasranch where the accident occurred.Katherine Armstrong, a lobbyist whose family owns the ranch,indicated in interviews that she and other members of her family, notCheney, had decided it was necessary to inform the public about theincident.After making that decision over breakfast Sunday morning, she andher mother, Anne Armstrong, a former top Republican official, ``ran itby'' Cheney, Katherine Armstrong told The Dallas Morning News. Sheadded that Cheney ``said something along the lines of, `You all dowhatever you are comfortable with.' ''Katherine Armstrong has lobbied the Bush administration onagriculture issues and lobbied the White House last year on SouthKorean policy on behalf of South Korean clients, according to federalrecords.The sheriff's office in KenedyCounty, where the Armstrong Ranch islocated, issued a news release about Saturday's incident saying``there was no alcohol, or misconduct involved,'' and that ``thisdepartment is fully satisfied that this was no more than a huntingaccident.''Carlos Valdez, the district attorney who prosecutes criminal casesin Kenedy County, said he had yet to speak with the sheriff'sofficials but is satisfied with what he knows of their investigation.In Corpus Christi, doctors said they had performed a cardiaccatheterization on Whittington, a procedure used to discover whetherarteries around the heart are blocked and there has been damage toheart function.Johns Hopkins University cardiologist Rick Lang said the patientlikely had a good prognosis. This kind of problem usually resolves onits own within one or two weeks, he said.Doctors were unsure of precisely where the birdshot nearWhittington's heart had lodged, Blanchard said.Mandeep Mehra, chief of cardiology at the University of MarylandSchool of Medicine, said the pellet might have ended up in thepericardium, the heart's protective covering. If so, it could haveinflamed this covering; this inflammation can also spread to theheart's chambers.
Vice President Dick Cheney's public mea culpaWednesday did little to clear up significant questions surrounding theaccidental shooting, including why the White House sat on the storyfor almost a full day and whether he received preferential treatmentfrom local deputies.Here is a look at some of those questions:Q. Why didn't the White House notify the public immediatelySaturday night that the vice president accidentally shot a man?A. Cheney makes it clear that it was his decision to wait almost afull day to go public. But he doesn't indicate why top Bush aides likeKarl Rove -- and even President Bush himself -- appear to havedeferred to him on it.Q. Why didn't Cheney just put the word out Saturday night to avoidrisking charges coming from critics now of a cover-up?A. Cheney said he waited overnight to find out how seriously victimHarry Whittington was hurt and to avoid rushing out inaccurateinformation.Q. Did Rove, Bush chief of staff Andrew Card or even Bush himselfwant Cheney to go public Saturday night?A. Unknown. In one of the more striking statements from thenation's No. 2 leader, Cheney says he didn't personally speak toanyone at the White House until Sunday morning, despite having beeninvolved in the shooting accident the night before.Rove told Bush at about 8 p.m. Saturday that Cheney was the shooter-- roughly an hour after the shooting occurred.Q. The White House has an elaborate media operation -- why didCheney bypass it and the national media outlets that cover the WhiteHouse around the clock?A. Also unclear. Cheney said only that he had no spokespersontraveling with him, even though his traveling staff can be in 24-7contact with the White House. But Cheney has done little in his fiveyears in office to disguise his disdain for the national media.Q. How did Cheney decide to alert the news media?A. On Sunday, ranch owner Katharine Armstrong initially told CNNthat she tipped off the local newspaper without first talking toCheney. But by Monday, the White House said Cheney agreed with hersuggestion and told her to give the story to a reporter she knew atthe Corpus Christi Caller-Times.Q. Why didn't the local sheriff's office talk to Cheney on the sameday as the shooting?A. Kenedy County Sheriff Ramon Salinas III and the federal SecretService have given conflicting accounts.On Sunday, Salinas told The New York Times that a deputy talked toCheney Saturday night. But CBS said the sheriff's office complained adeputy had been turned away that evening.On Monday, the Secret Service said its agents called Salinas soonafter the shooting and arranged for a Sunday morning meeting withCheney. Salinas said he decided not to send a deputy Saturday night.Q. Why didn't the sheriff charge Cheney in the shooting?A. Salinas said he decided it was an accident Saturday aftertalking to the Secret Service and a ranch hand he described as aformer deputy and Salinas' daughter's boyfriend. Salinas said Cheneyand Whittington also told deputies it was accidental. If Whittingtondies, however, the county prosecutor has said he might impanel a grandjury to investigate.Q. Whose fault was the shooting?A. Cheney Wednesday took full responsibility for the shooting,saying, ``You can't blame anybody else. I'm the guy who pulled thetrigger and shot my friend.'' But for three days, he let his friendand hunting host, Armstrong, blame the victim, saying it wasWhittington's fault for not telling other members of the hunting partyhe was nearby.In the end, hunting experts say it's one of the cardinal rules ofhunting, that responsibility ultimately lies with the shooter. ``Youshould know what you're shooting,'' said one veteran Texas huntingguide.
Vice President Dick Cheney said in a broadcastinterview Wednesday that he accepts full blame for mistakenly shootinga hunting partner last weekend, abandoning his tight-lipped stance onan accident that has drawn sharp criticism and proved damaging to theBush administration.In his first public comments on the incident, Cheney called the dayof the shooting ``one of the worst days of my life,'' appearing somberand shaken as he described having shot Harry M. Whittington, a78-year-old Austin, Texas, lawyer last Saturday afternoon.But Cheney was unrepentant during the 27-minute interview with BritHume of Fox News Channel about his decision not to tell the news mediaabout the accident until the next day. Cheney acknowledged waitinguntil after he knew ``that Harry was probably going to be OK'' beforeallowing it to be disclosed.At that point, Cheney said, leaving it to the owner of the Texasranch where the shooting occurred to contact one local reporter ``wasthe right call.''The vice president's decision to discuss the incident came afterthree days of intense criticism and was an unusual move for Cheney,who rarely grants interviews and then largely to conservative TV andradio commentators whose audience regards him as a hero.In this case, said Jennifer Mayfield, a spokeswoman, Cheney ``justwanted to talk to the American people, and we thought an interviewwould be the best way to do so.''Cheney used the opportunity to show a more human side to anaccident that has made him the butt of jokes and scathing criticism,and become a liability for a White House struggling to improve itsimage in an election year.Since Sunday, the incident has distracted attention from PresidentBush's activities, such as his visit Wednesday to Ohio to promote hishealth care proposals. It has also served to underscore criticism ofCheney and the administration as secretive and raised new questionsabout their credibility.Cheney said he is still haunted by the shooting.``The image of him falling is something I'll never ever be able toget out of my mind. I fired, and there's Harry falling. It was, I'dhave to say, one of the worst days of my life at that moment,'' saidCheney, who was interviewed in his ceremonial office in the oldExecutive Office Building next door to the White House.The vice president broke with allies who had suggested thatWhittington was at fault for wandering unannounced into Cheney's lineof fire.``I'm the guy who pulled the trigger that fired the round that hitHarry. You can talk about all of the other conditions that exist atthe time but that's the bottom line, and it was not Harry's fault,''Cheney said. ``You can't blame anybody else. I'm the guy who pulledthe trigger and shot my friend.''Whittington was in stable condition at a hospital in CorpusChristi, Texas, officials there said. He is under observation afterone of the pellets Cheney shot Saturday moved to his heart, causinginflammation and restricting blood flow in what doctors described as aminor heart attack early Tuesday.Cheney's hastily scheduled interview was a change in course by thevice president, whose office shared few details about the accident. Itcame as prominent Republicans and public relations specialists werecriticizing the White House for its handling of the story.Marlin Fitzwater, who served as White House press secretary forRonald Reagan and the first President Bush, faulted Cheney for theapproach in an interview with Editor & Publisher, saying he ``ignoredhis responsibility to the American people.'' Fitzwater told themagazine's Web site that he was ``appalled by the whole handling ofthis.''Cheney defended his decision to stay silent about the accidentuntil the next day, acknowledging that senior White House aides had``urged us to get the story out.'' He argued that, for the sake ofaccuracy, he wanted to wait until Whittington's condition was clearbefore contacting reporters.(Begin optional trim)Trevor Parry-Giles, a political communication specialist at theUniversity of Maryland, said in choosing to speak to Fox, a networkseen as more sympathetic to the administration than other newsoutlets, Cheney had chosen ``a perfect venue'' for him.But Parry-Giles added that the interview ``will only fuel thesuspicions that people already have about him, that he is unwilling toopen himself to criticism.''``I don't know that it will help him in terms of the publicperception,'' Parry-Giles said.(End optional trim)Democrats and liberal groups criticized Cheney for limiting hisremarks on the matter to one session with a network they called biasedin his favor.Sen. Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, noted that Cheney hasnot had a news conference to field questions from reporters in threeand a half years.``He ought to have one to clear the air not only on this issue, butmore importantly on the many other issues that have been shrouded by aveil of secrecy,'' Schumer said in a statement.Republicans rallied to Cheney's defense.``The constant second-guessing of what the vice president shouldhave said and when he should have said it is an unnecessary diversionfrom the many issues facing our nation,'' said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham,R-S.C.Asked whether he would go hunting again in the future, Cheney, anavid outdoorsman, said, ``I'll have to think about it.''``The season is ending,'' he added. ``I'm going to let some timepass over it and think about the future.''
WASHINGTON - An Austin lawyer accidentally shot by Vice President Cheneysuffered a minor heart attack Tuesday as a result ofbirdshot in his heart, complicating a White House effort tosteer attention away from the weekend hunting accident.One of the shotgun pellets that wounded Harry Whittington during aSaturday hunt at a South Texas ranch moved into hisheart and caused the attack, said Dr. David Blanchard ofChristus Spohn Hospital Corpus Christi-Memorial, where Whittington is being treated.Blanchard said Whittington is still expected to fully recover from beingpeppered with more than 100 birdshot pellets.At the White House, Press Secretary Scott McClellan, who patiently fieldedmore than 60 questions about the shooting on Monday, adopteda new tone on Tuesday as reporters pressed for answers.""We've got important work to do for the American people, andthat's where we're going to keep our focus. You're welcometo continue to focus on these issues. I'm moving on,""said McClellan, who learned about Whittington's heart attack shortly beforethe noon briefing but made no mention of it.Whittington's heart problem turned up during a routine evaluation of the78-year-old patient. The heart attack resulted from an irregular heartbeattriggered by a single piece of birdshot that had movedinto his heart.Blanchard said Whittington had no other symptoms or pain.""When birdshot is in your body there is always a riskit can move,"" he said. ""His arteries are clear andhe has the heart of a much younger individual.""Doctors did a cardiac catheterization and moved Whittington back into intensivecare. The procedure allows doctors to insert dye into theheart to map the blood supply and monitor for blockage.Blanchard said the birdshot is lodged in position and doesnot pose additional danger.""It was just a terrible, terrible accident,"" Peggy Puckett, one ofWhittington's four daughters, said Tuesday. ""No one was at fault.He feels bad for the vice president.""Asked if Whittington agreed with eyewitness accounts that said he wasat fault for approaching Cheney while he was shooting, Puckettsaid her father ""hasn't said anything like that.""At the White House, Cheney's office issued a statement on behalfof the vice president, who has yet to make apublic comment about the shooting. In it, Cheney aides saidhe was told Tuesday morning about Whittington's cardiac problem.Cheney watched part of the Corpus Christi news conference concerning Whittington'scondition. He then called Whittington and ""wished (him) well andasked if there was anything he needed.""""The vice president said that he stood ready to assist,"" thestatement said. ""Mr. Whittington's spirits were good, but obviously hissituation deserves the careful monitoring that his doctors are providing.The vice president said that his thoughts and prayers arewith Mr. Whittington and his family.""(Story can end here; Optional add follows)McClellan's effort to divert attention from the shooting persisted throughout theTuesday briefing.""We're moving on to the priorities of the American people. That'swhere our focus is,"" McClellan said. Those priorities, he added,include ""talking about how to make health care more affordableand accessible,"" a topic Bush is to address Wednesday inDublin, Ohio.McClellan fielded several more questions about the shooting, but added nonew information - including no mention of the heart attack- and referred questions to Cheney's office.One of the questions referred to a shooting-related joke McClellan hadtold at an earlier briefing on Tuesday. Before he wasaware of Whittington's updated condition, he made a humorous referenceto the fact that University of Texas football fans -at the White House for an event honoring UT's nationalchampion football team - would be clad in school colors.""The orange they're wearing is not because they are concerned thatthe vice president may be there,"" McClellan said, a referenceto the high-visibility orange worn by hunters as a safetyprecaution.By the noon briefing, aware of Whittington's heart attack, McClellan hada dour answer to a question about whether ""there isa certain degree of relief that Mr. Whittington seems tobe fine.""""Well, I think Mr. Whittington remains in our thoughts and prayers,""McClellan said. ""We all want to make sure that he'sOK and that he gets home and he recovers fully,and that's where our focus is and that's where itwill continue to be.""Ken Herman's e-mail address is kherman@coxnews.comSarah Coppola of the Austin American-Statesman reported from Corpus Christi.
The 78-year-old lawyer shot by Vice President Dick Cheneyin a hunting accident over the weekend suffered a minorheart attack early Tuesday from birdshot lodged in his heart,hospital officials in Texas said.The lawyer, Harry Whittington, was moved back into the intensive careunit at Christus Spohn Hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas, tobe monitored for up to a week in case thebirdshot shifted or additional pellets in his body moved intoother organs, the officials said at a televised news conference.Dr. David Blanchard, the emergency room chief, estimated that Whittingtonhad more than five but ""probably less than 150 to200"" pellets lodged in his body.Blanchard said that the hospital's cardiologists were optimistic that the pelletin Whittington's heart would not travel farther and that hewould be able to function normally. They said they didnot consider the other pellets in his body problematic.Cheney's office, in its first official announcement about the incident, releaseda statement shortly after 2:30 p.m. Eastern time saying thatthe vice president's ""thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Whittingtonand his family"" and that Cheney had spoken by telephoneto Whittington an hour earlier.""The vice president wished Mr. Whittington well and asked if therewas anything he needed,"" the statement said. ""The vice presidentsaid that he stood ready to assist.""The statement added that Whittington's spirits were ""good,"" but ""obviously hissituation deserves the careful monitoring that his doctors are providing.""The downturn in Whittington's health significantly changed the tone of theWhite House reaction to the hunting accident. In Texas, CarlosValdez, the district attorney in Kleberg County, said a fatalitywould immediately spur a new report from the local sheriffand, most likely, a grand jury investigation.Cheney's aides said he first learned of the change in Whittington'scondition when he arrived at his West Wing office about7:40 a.m. on Tuesday, shortly after doctors in Corpus Christisaid that they had picked up an irregular heartbeat fromWhittington during their morning rounds.Doctors said that the pellet, which they had known since theaccident was near Whittington's heart, had evidently moved into theheart muscle, causing ""some quivering"" called atrial fibrillation. Whittington, whohad been shot by Cheney on Saturday and moved outof intensive care on Monday, was immediately put back intointensive care.
When the White House press secretary, Scott McClellan, enteredthe press room Tuesday morning and suggested he was wearingan orange tie to avoid a stray shot from VicePresident Dick Cheney, it seemed to signal an effort todefuse the accidental-shooting story with a laugh.But by midday, it was clear that the staffs of thepresident and the vice president had failed to communicate. Justafter arriving at work around 7:45 a.m., Cheney learned thatthe man he shot, Harry Whittington, was about to undergoa heart procedure because his injuries were more serious thanearlier believed, Cheney's spokeswoman said.No one in Cheney's office passed the word to McClellan, seniorofficials at the White House said, adding that the presssecretary never would have joked about the shooting accident ifhe had known about the turn of events involving Whittington.It was the latest example of the degree to whichCheney's habit of living in his own world in theBush White House -- surrounded by his own staff, relyingon his own instincts, saying as little as possible --had backfired since the accident in Texas on Saturday. Cheney'sstaff members have kept their comments to chronological details andto repeating Cheney's written statements.The tension between President Bush's staff and Cheney's has been palpable,with White House officials whispering to reporters about how theytried to handle the news of the shooting differently.McClellan, while being careful not to cross Cheney or his aidesdirectly, has made a point of reminding reporters of howhe dealt with Bush's bicycle accident last summer, when thepresident collided with a policeman at the G-8 summit. ""Iimmediately briefed the press on how the accident had happened,and the condition of the police officer,"" who was takento the hospital with minor injuries, McClellan said. His messagewas clear: There was a procedure for conveying this kindof news, and it was not followed in this case.Several White House officials said no one among the White Housestaff, including the chief of staff, Andrew H. Card, feltempowered to dictate how news of the shooting accident wouldbe handled. Presumably the Bush himself could have declared howthe news would be disseminated, something he does often onpolicy matters.Until this week, the periodic disconnect between Cheney's office and therest of the White House has been the source ofgrumbling, but rarely open tension.
The account given Tuesday by doctors caring for the Texas lawyeraccidentally shot by Vice President Dick Cheney last weekend raisesserious questions about how and when a pellet entered hisheart and what tests were done to establish where thepellet was lodged, doctors not connected with his case said.Although the public was told for the first time on Tuesdaythat a shotgun pellet from a hunting accident had lodgedin the lawyer's heart, one of his doctors said that""we knew that he had some birdshot very close tothe heart from the get-go,"" but not its precise location.Such evidence would have come from standard chest X-rays and aCT scan if one was performed shortly after his admissionto a hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas.Earlier accounts described as minor the pellet wounds that the lawyer,Harry M. Whittington, suffered in the face, neck, chest andribs.Cheney sprayed Whittington, 78, with six to 200 pieces of birdshot,the doctors said Tuesday. One pellet apparently moved to damagehis heart, causing two problems: an abnormal heart rhythm, atrialfibrillation, and a minor heart attack that were detected earlyTuesday morning, the doctors said in a news conference atChristus Spohn Hospital in Corpus Christi.Their account left open the source of the birdshot that migratedto the heart and how it got there.Dr. O. Wayne Isom, the chairman of heart and chest surgeryat Weill Cornell Medical College, said it was unlikely thata pellet would migrate to the heart through the bloodstream,as some have assumed from the account of the Texasdoctors.The reason, Isom said, is that the pellet would have toenter a vein, travel to and through the lung vesselsthat go to the heart, and then lodge in hearttissue, not in one of its chambers. The pellets wereapproximately 5 millimeters, about the size of a BB, andlarger than most blood vessels, said Dr. David Blanchard, directorof emergency services at the hospital.A more likely explanation, Isom said, is that the pellet lodgedin or touched the heart when Whittington was shot.Doctors use different X-ray techniques to determine the position of apellet in the heart. But the account of the Texasdoctors was unclear regarding which ones they performed and when.Dr. Peter Banko, the Texas hospital's emergency department medical director, saiddoctors there did an ultrasound, a CT scan and acardiac catheterization, which provide two-dimensional images. Banko said the hospitalhad a 64-slice CT scan that could provide three-dimensional images,but he did not say that the doctors performed themore sophisticated one on Whittington, or if so, when.Doctors try to synchronize such CT X-rays with the heartbeat toavoid blurring from motion, said Dr. Jeffrey P. Goldman, aspecialist in heart CT scans at Manhattan Diagnostic Radiology. But,Goldman said, doctors cannot synchronize a CT scan in patientswith atrial fibrillation.Metal in a pellet can cause a different kind of blurringin CT scans. But the Texas doctors did not saythat they performed a 64-slice CT scan after they learnedWhittington had a pellet near his heart and before hedeveloped the abnormal heart rhythm.Goldman said that ""until you do the test you don't knowhow much blurring there is.""Isom said patients could develop atrial fibrillation two to three daysafter stitches were placed in a heart or it wasinjured.The Texas doctors did not say how they determined that Whittingtonhad had a heart attack. Two standard tests are fromelectrocardiograms and measuring enzymes. But injuries to the heart cancause a rise in enzymes that may not necessarily representa heart attack.The Texas doctors and the White House doctors with whom theydiscussed Whittington's case did not respond to a request forinterviews.
A Texas sheriff's office has clearedU.S. Vice President Dick Cheney of any wrongdoing in a shooting accident at a ranch in the state Saturday, the USA Today newspaperreported Tuesday.Cheney accidentally shot fellow hunter Harry Whittington while they were hunting quail at the Armstrong Ranch, in southern Texas.The Kenedy County Sheriff's Office near the ranch interviewed bothmen after the Secret Service called to notify them shortly after the shooting, the report said.The sheriff's office said investigation revealed that there wasno alcohol or misconduct involved in the incident, which ""was no more than a hunting accident.""Cheney did violate one small legal requirement, the report said.Cheney's office said Monday that while Cheney had a 125-U.S. dollar non-resident Texas hunting license, he lacked a required 7-dollar stamp to hunt upland game birds such as quail. In a statement, his office said Cheney has mailed a 7-dollar check for the stamp.The White House worked on Monday to explain why it took almost 20 hours for the public to first learn of the accident.""The first priority was making sure that Harry Whittington, Mr.Whittington, was getting the medical care that he needed,"" White House spokesman Scott McClellan said.President George W. Bush and White House deputy chief of staff Karl Rove were told of the shooting Saturday night but deferred toCheney on providing information to the public, a report in Tuesday's The Washington Post said.The Post report said even some White House officials thought Cheney mishandled the responses and opened the administration to criticism that it was withholding important public information.Whittington, 78, an Austin lawyer and longtime Republican activist, was in stable condition at Christus Spohn Hospital-Memorial in Corpus Christi, Texas, news reports said.
","Harry Whittington, the Texas lawyer shot by Vice President Cheney, suffered a heart attack as a result of birdshot in his heart. One of the 100 shotgun pellets that wounded him moved into his heart and caused the attack. Doctors decided not to remove the pellet, saying they would treat his condition medically. The White House Press Secretary learned about the heart attack just before a press conference, but he did not mention it. The accident and heart attach caused a media frenzy. Some Cheney friends blamed Whittington, but five days later, Cheney spoke to the media, accepting full responsibility. ","On Feb. 14 Whittington suffered a setback when a shotgun pellet penetrated his heart. His worsened condition focused attention on the unanswered questions: Whose fault and why the delay in reporting? In Texas a sheriff's office cleared Cheney of any wrongdoing. On the question of delay, Bush's staff deferred to Cheney's and Cheney's to their Texas hosts. On Feb. 15 Cheney broke his silence in a Fox News interview, accepting full-blame for the shooting, but defending his decision to leave the reporting of the incident to the owner of the ranch where it occurred. ","An Austin Lawyer accidentally shot by Vice President Cheney suffered a minor heart attack February 14 as a result of birdshot in his heart. He is in stable condition and is still expected to fully recover. Doctors are optimistic the pellet won't cause future problems. Democrats accused Cheney of a pattern of secrecy for his delay in reporting the incident. He spoke about the incident in an interview on February 15, calling the day one of the worst of his life and accepting full blame for the accident. A Texas sheriff's office cleared Cheney of any wrongdoing in the incident. ","A buckshot pellet caused Whittington to suffer atrial fibrillation and a ""silent"" heart attack by the morning of February 14. He was returned to intensive care. Between 5 and 200 pellets are lodged in his body. He's expected to remain hospitalized for a week. Cheney's office released its first statement that afternoon, as conflicting stories began to surface. The handling of the incident highlighted the administration's penchant for secrecy and tensions between Bush's and Cheney's staffs. On the afternoon of the 15th during a FOX News interview, Cheney accepted blame for the shooting, but defended the information handling. "
D0938,D0938-A,"All four living former US presidents have agreed to become honorarydirectors of the project for a permanent memorial to the victims ofthe September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center.New York Governor George Pataki said Monday that Gerald Ford, JimmyCarter, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton had all pledged theirsupport for the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation and wouldserve as honorary members of the board of directors.""The memorial will be the centerpiece and our first priority in therebuilding effort,"" Pataki said at a luncheon event in New York City.""Reflecting Absence"" by architect Michael Arad, which features tworeflecting pools surrounded by gardens, was chosen from 5,201 entriessubmitted to an international design competition.The pools are to sit almost empty, with water running down the sidesonly, symbolizing the vacuum left by the 2,749 people who died whentwo hijacked planes were crashed into the trade center's twin towers.The memorial is scheduled to open in 2009.Carter, Bush and Clinton were all together just last week, when theyattended the dedication of Clinton's presidential library. Ford, 91,had been unable to attend the event.
Four US ex-presidents, a Hollywood legend, a retired fireman and astar TV journalist were among those appointed Wednesday to lead theproject for a memorial to the victims of the September 11, 2001attack on the World Trade Center.A total of 31 people were named to the board of directors of thememorial foundation, a non-profit corporation that will construct,own, operate and maintain the memorial.Along with a slew of prominent business leaders, the list includedactor Robert De Niro, veteran TV correspondent Barbara Walters andCanadian former prime minster Brian Mulroney.Former US presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush andBill Clinton were all named honorary members.""We can never forget the tragic events of September 11,"" New YorkMayor Michael Bloomberg said in a statement.""That is why it is so important that when the new World Trade Centerhas been completed, we have a memorial that captures the depth ofthose attacks and preserves their full impact for futuregenerations,"" he said.""Reflecting Absence"" by architect Michael Arad, which features tworeflecting pools surrounded by gardens, was chosen from 5,201 entriessubmitted to an international memorial design competition.The pools are to sit almost empty, with water running down the sidesonly, symbolizing the vacuum left by the 2,749 people who died whentwo hijacked planes were crashed into the trade center's twin towers.The memorial is scheduled to open in 2009.The memorial board also included retired New York firefighter LeeIelpi and Monica Iken, whose husband was killed in the trade centerattack.""At the heart of the rebuilding is the creation of a lasting memorialwhich will honor the memories of those we lost and help tell theirstory to the world,"" said New York Governor George Pataki.
Robert De Niro, Barbara Walters, David Rockefeller and other members of thefoundation charged with raising money for a World Trade Center memorial heldtheir first meeting.The 33-member board set up governance and executive committees before meetingWednesday with trade center master planner Daniel Libeskind and memorialarchitect Michael Arad near the building site.Arad said his memorial will try ""to make present what is absent"" since the Sept.11, 2001, terrorist attack that brought down the twin towers and otherbuildings.The meeting came on the same day that Gov. George Pataki urged passage of anincome tax checkoff that would allow New York taxpayers to donate to thememorial.The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation's board also includes former CanadianPrime Minister Brian Mulroney, Disney CEO Michael Eisner and several tradecenter victims' family members.They have been given the task of raising $500 million (euro378 million) to buildboth a memorial to the victims of the 2001 and 1993 trade center attacks andadjoining cultural facilities.The memorial will include a forest of oak trees with a clearing for Sept. 11gatherings and a Memorial Hall between the reflecting pools that will mark thefootprints of the lost towers.Lower Manhattan Development Corp. Chairman John Whitehead last month calledMemorial Hall a public space where visitors will be able to ""review a directoryof the names, locating their loved ones among the souls that arethere.""Whitehead's agency was created to oversee redevelopment at and around the tradecenter site.
A fragment of granite bearing the name ""John"" _ all that remains of a memorialto the six people killed in the first terror attack on the World Trade Center _was installed Saturday as the central piece of a new memorial.In a ceremony above the gaping pit remaining from the Sept. 11, 2001, attackthat destroyed the complex and the original memorial, an honor guard of PortAuthority officers placed the fragment in a 9 1/2-foot-tall (2.9-meter-high)steel pylon shaped like one of the twin towers.The rose-colored granite was part of a memorial fountain erected in 1995 tohonor those killed on Feb. 26, 1993, when 1,200 pounds of explosives weredetonated in a rented van in a parking garage under the towers.""We have to remember that 9/11 began in 1993,"" said Michael Macko of New YorkCity, son of victim William Macko. ""My father and these other five people werethe first World Trade Center victims, and it's our duty to make sure they're notforgotten.""Nancy Burroughs, sister of victim Stephen Knapp, said ""a lot of lessons couldhave been learned from that bombing that might have made a difference on9/11.""The other victims were John Di Giovanni, the ""John"" on the surviving fragment;Robert Kirkpatrick; Wilfredo Mercado; and Monica Rodriguez Smith.At a memorial Mass in nearby St. Peter's Church, the Rev. Kevin Madigan said inhis sermon that the 2001 attack ""in no way eclipses"" the losses of 1993, butmakes them ""all the more real, all the more personal.""Gov. George Pataki said the world has ""a sacred duty to remember"" and MayorMichael Bloomberg said the new memorial ""will speak to generations of NewYorkers of our duty to remain relentlessly vigilant.""
Having been eclipsed for most of this year by other issues at groundzero, the World Trade Center memorial returned to the forefrontMonday as Gov. George E. Pataki offered a preview of the completeddesign, which he said will be ready next month.In describing the memorial -- ""Picture the old foundations of theLouvre in France or the catacombs at the Vatican"" -- Pataki said thecolumn remnants of the twin towers would be kept visible, ""layingbare the very roots of the towers as visitors absorb the meaning ofwhat took place here.""The governor said that financing of the memorial should be the ""firstand most important"" priority for the $816 million in federal grantsthat have yet to be allocated by the Lower Manhattan DevelopmentCorp. He also called for an overall spending plan by March, sincedemands downtown far exceed the available grants.Pataki said former Presidents Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter, GeorgeH.W. Bush and Bill Clinton would serve as honorary members of thememorial foundation, which will raise money for the memorial and thecultural centers. The working members of the board are to be namednext week by the governor and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.And Pataki announced that the underground memorial interpretivecenter, where artifacts and exhibits will tell the story of the tradecenter and the 2001 and 1993 attacks, will be designed by theManhattan firm Davis Brody Bond, which is already associated withMichael Arad and Peter Walker on the memorial itself; the Norwegianfirm Snohetta, which is working on the museum complex at the tradecenter site; and Howard-Revis Design of Washington, which specializesin designing exhibits.J. Max Bond Jr., a partner in Davis Brody Bond who accompanied Patakiat ground zero Monday, said, ""Of course we're pleased, if somewhatapprehensive, since the stakes are so high and the projects areimportant and demanding.""In the governor's fourth progress report on Lower Manhattan, to 420guests of the Association for a Better New York at the Ritz-CarltonNew York in Battery Park City, he was short on big news -- when willthe damaged Fiterman Hall be razed? what is the status of the WestStreet bypass? where will an extra $3 billion come from to build atrain tunnel from downtown to Long Island? -- but long on smaller yetvital details.For instance, he outlined the early construction schedule of theFreedom Tower. Excavation of 18,000 cubic yards of bedrock for thecolumn footings will begin in February, he said. By April, steel andconcrete will arrive. A three-foot-thick concrete liner will be builtto reinforce the slurry wall around the trade center foundations.Later in 2005, he said, the floor slabs and tower columns of theskyscraper will start to rise.Next month, Pataki said, construction is to begin on the new SouthFerry subway station and on two stations that are part of the plannedFulton Street Transit Center on Broadway. Also next month, he said,deconstruction will begin on the damaged, shrouded 40-story DeutscheBank building across Liberty Street from the trade center site.After his speech, Pataki visited the 21st floor of the Deutsche Bankbuilding and then the muddy pit of ground zero, where outlines of thecolumn remnants of 1 World Trade Center have been exposed.
The task of raising half a billion dollars to build a World TradeCenter memorial, a museum building and a performing arts center willfall to a foundation made up of captains of finance and real estate,cultural leaders, media heavyweights and seven relatives of thosekilled on 9/11.After months of searching and one awkward false start last springwhen two prospective co-chairmen, Jerry I. Speyer and Sanford I.Weill, backed away from the job, Gov. George E. Pataki and MayorMichael R. Bloomberg were able Wednesday to name 31 members of theboard of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation.John C. Whitehead, the chairman of the Lower Manhattan DevelopmentCorp., will head the foundation until the board members have a chanceto meet next month and select a chairman. Until Wednesday afternoon,even the designated members did not know whom all their colleagueswould be.Heading the list of boldface names, in one arena or another, areRobert DeNiro, who has been a presence in the nearby TriBeCa area formany years; Barbara Walters of ABC; David Rockefeller, who was deeplyinvolved in the original development of the World Trade Center; andMichael D. Eisner, the chief executive of the Walt Disney Co.The roster seems to reflect some geopolitical ticket-splitting, withthe chairmen of giant downtown companies like American Express,American International Group and the Bank of New York balanced byRobert Wood Johnson IV, the owner of the New York Jets, who hopes tobuild a new football stadium on the far West Side.""You probably won't find a board of any higher caliber anywhere inthe city,"" said Bloomberg, who knows a thing or two aboutphilanthropy. ""And that's really exactly what is called for becausethere isn't a more noble task before us.""The mission of the nonprofit foundation is to oversee and coordinatefund-raising and construction of the memorial and the culturalbuildings at the trade center site. It will also own and operate thebuildings.Though the foundation will not formally begin raising money untilnext year, Bloomberg all but made the second big pledge as he stoodat the lectern in the lobby of the American Express headquarters inthe World Financial Center at Battery Park City.""As the mayor of New York and also as a citizen of New York,"" hesaid, ""I plan to do my part to ensure these projects reach their fullpotential.""The first big pledge may be said to have come last week, when Patakideclared in a speech that the highest priority for the remaining $816million in unallocated federal grants controlled by the LowerManhattan Development Corp. should be ""to guarantee that we have thefunds necessary to build the memorial.""Conceivably, then, the foundation may start its $500 million campaignwith several hundred million dollars already available.Pataki had already said that four former presidents -- Bill Clinton,George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald R. Ford -- would behonorary members. One of the working members will be Brian Mulroney,a former prime minister of Canada, whose presence symbolizes theinternational importance of the memorial, said Kevin M. Rampe,president of the development corporation and a foundation boardmember.Speyer, the chairman and chief executive of Tishman SpeyerProperties, whose portfolio includes Rockefeller Center and theChrysler Building, agreed to serve on the board that he would notlead. ""I wanted to be helpful but, frankly, it was a matter of time,""he said Wednesday.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)The members announced Wednesday are:Paula Grant Berry.

The World Trade Center memorial will preserve not only the memory ofthose who died on Sept. 11, 2001, but the remnants -- visible andeven tangible -- of the buildings that died that morning, too.Severed during the clearing of ground zero, many steel and concretecolumn footings that still outline the perimeters of the twin towerswill be made part of the memorial itself, as will a 70-foot-tall,250-foot-long section of the original slurry wall.On Thursday, almost a year after the world saw the earliestrenderings of the plan called ""Reflecting Absence,"" three architectsguided their listeners -- the governor of New York and the mayor ofNew York City among them -- on a trip through the schematic design,showing in more detail the spaces that will compose the memorial whenit opens in 2009.Beginning on a plaza forested with some 300 oak trees and aone-and-a-half-acre open area that can double as a civic gatheringplace for as many as 10,000 people, visitors will make their way downtwo switchback ramps, each as long as a city block, that will takethem 30 feet below ground into the central memorial hall.Here, both pool-filled voids marking the absent towers will bevisible through cascading curtains of water, each ringed with thenames of the dead. The pools will be centered within, but slightlysmaller than, the tower outlines. Forty feet below, within inches ofbedrock itself, unidentified remains will be entombed.On this level, the north tower's foundations will be exposed in achamber more than 60 feet high. Visitors will be able to touch thejagged steel and the rough concrete.""I am looking forward to the day when I will be privileged to setfoot and walk down those ramps to the bedrock and, like the familymembers, bend over and pay my tribute in an appropriate memorial,""Gov. George E. Pataki said Thursday.Kevin M. Rampe, the president of the Lower Manhattan DevelopmentCorp., which is overseeing the memorial, described the new elementsas ""simple acts, knitted together to create a powerful memorial atthe heart of the World Trade Center site.""
Don't look now -- actually, you can't looknow -- but a great deal of decision-making about thepublic realm at the new World Trade Center may disappearfrom public view behind closed boardroom doors.The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation board met Wednesday for thefirst time before emerging for an introduction to the siteby the architects Daniel Libeskind and Michael Arad. Because theboard includes Robert De Niro and Barbara Walters, there weremany cameras and microphones to capture that moment in theWinter Garden of the World Financial Center, overlooking ground zero.Images and sound bites convey a false sense of accessibility, however.The truth is that the two-hour meeting was closed tothe public and the news media, since the foundation isa private corporation.Officials have long complimented themselves -- sometimes with good reason --on the openness and transparency of planning efforts at thetrade center site. But the future may hold opacity, orat least translucence, as the nonprofit foundation assumes more ofthe role that the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. has performeduntil now.The impact of this shift has not received much attention, perhapsbecause the very name ""Foundation"" understates the new body's roleand potential clout. On the face of it, it soundslike a genteel, cup-in-hand group that will solicit charitable contributionsthat the development corporation, a state agency, cannot.Indeed, the foundation will be a fund-raising organization. ""All levels ofgifts -- from $1 to $100 million -- will besought and accepted,"" said its September 2003 application for tax-exemptstatus under section 501(c)3 of the internal revenue code. (Withabout $3.5 million now in hand, $496.5 million is stillto be raised.)But the foundation was given a broader range of powers inits April 2003 certificate of incorporation, beginning with its purpose:""To own, construct, operate and maintain a memorial and relatedstructures and appurtenances on the site of the World TradeCenter.""Own. Construct. Operate. Maintain.That is a lot of responsibility, with many implications for theway the public will experience the memorial, the interpretive memorialcenter and the museums and the theaters, since the foundationis also charged with ""encouraging the development of cultural facilitiesas part of the redevelopment of the World Trade Centersite.""The foundation has a lot of power to do these jobs.It may ""solicit, accept, hold, invest, reinvest and administer anygifts, bequests, devises, benefits of trusts and property of anysort, without limitation as to amount or value, and touse, disburse or donate the principal or income."" (A deviseis a gift of real property by will.) It mayalso ""purchase, lease, receive, own, sell and convey real andpersonal property of all kinds.""But it does not have to let the public listen in.""There is no law that requires that the board must beopen,"" said Ira M. Millstein, a senior partner in thelaw firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges, who is counsel tothe development corporation board and one of the foundation's directors.The board could choose to operate more openly. ""This is adecision for the board to make,"" Millstein said. ""It's verydifficult to have a hair-down discussion with everyone watching. Onthe other hand, we want to be completely transparent.""Wednesday's session was largely procedural, according to those who were there.Deputy Mayor Patricia E. Harris became the 33rd director andJason R. Lilien was named counsel. Walters, the one reporterin the room, raised the issue of openness. John C.Whitehead, the interim chairman, told board members that meeting minuteswould be made public.The Lower Manhattan Development Corp. maintains a virtual library of importantplanning documents on its Web site, www.renewnyc.com, and opens itsmonthly board meetings to the public and the press. True,almost all the substantive work goes on behind the scenes.But several useful civic purposes are served.For one, the principals almost always attend. This means that citizenswho show up to register their unhappiness with the corporation-- particularly for its failure to finance more job-creation andlower-income housing programs -- may be assured at least thattheir placards, banners and lapel buttons are being read bythe people in charge.One can argue whether these quiet protests have any meaningful effectbut the board can never adjourn under the impression thatits policies are uniformly popular.Last month, for instance, members of the Restaurant Opportunities Center ofNew York showed up to criticize the corporation for nothelping finance a restaurant planned downtown to employ displaced workersfrom Windows on the World. The matter was not evenon the agenda but the workers had a chance tomake their grievance felt.Reporters are given about 10 minutes after each meeting to askquestions of anyone on the board, particularly those who wouldotherwise be hard to reach. The principals typically stay forthis question-and-answer session, even though they are sometimes put onthe spot.Meetings can be revealing. Though they are tightly organized, with littlefreewheeling discussion, it is possible to see fissures within theboard by paying attention to the questions, objections and exceptionsthat members register, even as they vote -- generally unanimously-- to adopt the items before them.Kevin M. Rampe, the president of the development corporation and afoundation director, said, ""The board clearly understands the public trustwhich they have undertaken and are committed to the samelevel of transparency as the LMDC.""
It is just a few feet high. Butit could profoundly affect a visitor's experience by creating theneed for a wall running more than 200 feet alongthe Greenwich Street side of the memorial, marking an abruptgrade change between plaza level and sidewalk.Between this wall and the museum complex at Fulton Street anda stairway at Liberty Street, there would be only twosmall areas where one could walk straight into the memorialfrom Greenwich Street, the approach most visitors will probably take.To the public, the tough part of designing the memorial mayseem to have passed last year with the choice ofa concept, the twin voids of ""Reflecting Absence,"" and theselection of architects: Michael Arad, Peter Walker & Partners andDavis Brody Bond.But new challenges are unfolding, largely out of sight, as plannersstruggle to reconcile an architectural vision with the physical realitiesof a complex site. At stake in these negotiations areelements as important as the whole east side of thememorial, which may depend on what may seem like arcanequestions of roadway layout.The bump -- really, more of a hump -- would occurin Greenwich Street at Dey Street. Here, the surface wouldbe 2 feet higher than at Fulton Street to thenorth and 6 feet higher than at Liberty Street tothe south.The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which ownsthe site and will build the streets, said that heightwould permit the installation of as many utility lines asare needed within the roadbed, directly above the subway tunnelfor the Nos. 1 and 9 trains, with sufficient coveringover the tunnel to satisfy Metropolitan Transportation Authority standards. Theslope would allow water drainage and prevent puddling in thestreet.However, it would also mean that Greenwich Street would rise almost5 feet higher than the memorial plaza. There is notroom enough to accommodate a stairway at this location becausethe footprint of the south tower -- an immovable elementin the equation -- is too close to the sidewalk.And the plaza cannot be canted upward to meet Greenwich Streetbecause the voids will have walls of cascading water within,which must be kept absolutely level. Any slope in theplaza would be apparent around the perimeter of the voids.If Greenwich Street must rise that high, the Lower Manhattan DevelopmentCorp. has concluded that a wall will be needed alongmuch of the adjacent part of the memorial. Not onlywould that wall block physical access but it would alsodiminish the designers' goal of direct sight lines into theplaza from the surrounding sidewalks.As an alternative, the corporation has proposed lowering Greenwich Street byfour feet. That would permit a level approach to thememorial at Dey Street. (Because of the changing topography aroundthe site, stairways will still be needed to reach theplaza level from the sidewalks at the southeast, southwest andnorthwest corners.)""It's absolutely critical that we take the steps necessary to setthe grade in a way that achieves the objective weall share of knitting the site back into the community,both physically and visually,"" Kevin M. Rampe, president of thedevelopment corporation, said Wednesday.But the corporation's alternative raises more questions. Where would utility linesgo if they could not fit in a shallower GreenwichStreet roadbed? Why not raise the entire plaza level abit? And how appropriate is it for architecture to setstreet heights, rather than the other way around?""The construction of Greenwich Street through the World Trade Center siteis another of the complex engineering issues that must becarefully studied and resolved as we move forward with theredevelopment,"" said Kenneth J. Ringler Jr., the executive director ofthe Port Authority.As engaging as last season's architectural beauty contests may have been,the real form of the future World Trade Center isbeing decided now. God is in the details, Mies vander Rohe is often quoted as saying. So is thedevil.HOW THE HEIGHTS ARE MEASUREDHow do you measure heights on a site with so manylevels above and below ground? Engineers typically rely on adatum, a constant plane from which elevations can be uniformlycalculated. Different data are used for different purposes.The World Trade Center Downtown Restoration Program datum is closely relatedto that of the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad, now PATH,which was integral to the development of the twin towersin the 1960s. Because the railroad datum was deliberately setvery deep -- exactly 300 feet below mean sea levelat Sandy Hook, N.J. -- all measurements from it canbe expressed as positive elevations.The trade center datum is 2.653 feet above the old railroaddatum. On this scale, the high point on Greenwich Streetis at elevation 316 feet, the memorial plaza at 311.2feet.For comparison's sake, the PATH station concourse is at elevation 276feet, the mezzanine at 264 feet and the passenger platformsat 250 feet. The base of the trade center siteis at elevation 243 feet. The lowest point in thePATH system is midway in Tunnel E, the outbound routefrom the trade center to New Jersey, at elevation 212feet.-- DAVID W. DUNLAP
The architectural team designing the World Trade Center (WTC)memorial presented an update on its plans Thursday afternoon.Governor George Pataki and Mayor Michael Bloomberg joined the team ofarchitects to present a more detailed description of what visitorswill experience at the memorial and the surrounding plaza.The updated design will not include any changes to the random listingof the victims' names. The families of some rescue workers wantedtheir loved ones listed separately, though police officers,firefighters and paramedics will be identifiable by the insignia oftheir respective agencies.""We have to have a memorial that really allows us to connect thesheer enormity of the Twin Towers, to the individuals that were takenfrom us,"" said Bloomberg.Pataki praised designers for creating a fitting memorial to those wholost their lives at the WTC site. He said the memorial will help tellthe story of Sept. 11 and the lost lives, so that future generationswill understand the enormity of what happened here.The new schematic design features a vast landscaped civic plaza,cascading voids with deeply recessed pools and an area for those lostbut never identified.""The primary responsibility that we have is to those who lost so muchon that terrible day,"" said memorial designer Michael Arad. ""We wantto show, to make clear, what a great loss we all suffered. ""In January, 2004, a 13-member jury selected ""Reflecting Absence "" byMichael Arad and Peter Walker as the design for the WTC memorial.Over the past months, the design team, with associate architect MaxBond, embarked on the schematic design process to develop thephysical and programmatic elements of the memorial.The memorial, which will commemorate the nearly 3,000 victims of theSept.11 terror attacks and the 1993 bombing, is expected to becompleted by 2009.
","Four US ex-presidents, a Hollywood legend, a retired fireman and a star TV journalist were among the 31 appointed in December 2004 to lead the project for a memorial to the victims of the September 11, 2001, attack on New York's World Trade Center. They were to be directors of the foundation that would construct, own, operate and maintain the memorial. Architect Michael Arad's design was chosen from 5,201 entries in an international competition. It featured two reflecting pools surrounded by gardens. Part of the $500 million in financing will come from New York's $816 million in federal grants. ","The World Trade Center Foundation held its first meeting on January 6. Its priority is raising $500 million to build a memorial and two cultural buildings. The four living former US presidents are honorary directors. Prominent foundation members include Robert De Niro, Barbara Walters, David Rockefeller, and former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney. Michael Arad's design, Reflecting Absence, was chosen for the memorial. It is planned to include a forest of oak trees and a Memorial Hall. An underground interpretive center will house artifacts from the 1993 and 2001 attacks. The memorial is scheduled to open in 2009. ","The task of raising $500M for the World Trade Center memorial will fall to foundation made up of leaders from finance and real estate, cultural leaders, media celebrities and relatives of 9/11 victims. All four living ex-presidents of the US have agreed to become honorary directors of the project. The foundation is accepting all levels of gifts. Governor Pataki said financing of the memorial should be the top priority for allocating money from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation's $816M grant. The WTC memorial named ""Reflecting Absence"" features two reflecting pools surround by gardens. It was chosen from 5201 entries. ","In December 2004, 31 people were named to the board of directors of the World Trade Center (WTC) Memorial Foundation. This is a non-profit corporation to oversee fundraising and construction, then own and operate the memorial on the WTC site. The memorial will have a plaza, fountains, ramps, building and human remains, names of victims, and fragments of the 1993 memorial. There also will be an interpretation center, museum and arts center. Its completion is scheduled for 2009. The foundation is faced with raising almost 1/2 billion dollars and overseeing the reconciliation of the architectural vision with the physical realities. "
D0938,D0938-B,"The clock ran out last week for public comments on NewYork state's plan to condemn almost an entire block southof ground zero, the last parcel needed for the fullredevelopment of the World Trade Center site.Conspicuously absent from the comments submitted to the Lower Manhattan DevelopmentCorp. was any objection from the Milstein family, owners ofthe land the state proposes to take.""We're hopeful that we will have a satisfactory resolution soon,"" saida spokesman for Paul and Howard P. Milstein, father andson, who run Milstein Properties and are co-chairmen of theEmigrant Savings Bank.The Milsteins' conciliatory statement, which is all they will say onthe subject, sets the stage for negotiations -- one stepahead of formal condemnation -- over a vital parcel thatis to serve as the gateway to the ramps, serviceroads, loading docks and parking spaces under the future tradecenter.""We remain hopeful that we'll be able to reach a negotiatedsettlement,"" Kevin M. Rampe, president of the Lower Manhattan DevelopmentCorp., said Wednesday.Known on city maps as Block 56, this parallelogram-shaped property isbounded by Liberty, Washington, Cedar and West Streets. The Milsteinsown all but the lot on which St. Nicholas GreekOrthodox Church stood until it was crushed by 2 WorldTrade Center.But the Milsteins have been unable to use their land sinceSept. 11, 2001. Today, Block 56 is controlled by thePort Authority of New York and New Jersey. It servesas a parking lot, staging area and roadway into thetrade center site.The Milsteins bought their 20,000-square-foot property in 1978. In 1981, theyannounced plans for a 35-story, 400,000-square-foot office building, to becalled 1 World Plaza, or 140 Liberty Street. Designed bythe Vilkas Group, it would have been connected at thesecond-story level with a pedestrian bridge to 1 Bankers TrustPlaza, which was later known as the Deutsche Bank building.There was no market for that project, but the Milsteins keptexploring possibilities. They tried to acquire the St. Nicholas property,going so far as to discuss projects in which theywould construct a new sanctuary for the Greek Orthodox Churchin the base of a larger building. More recently, theyhad focused on residential or hotel development. Meanwhile, the sitewas used as a parking lot.Control of the property was assumed by the City Department ofDesign and Construction after Sept. 11, 2001. The city thenpassed control to the Port Authority.The authority has never entered into a lease or other agreementwith the Milsteins, although there were some discussions in 2002.The authority has not paid any money to the Milsteinsfor using this block.(The church property will not be taken by eminent domain butswapped for a larger parcel nearby on which a newsanctuary and interdenominational center will be built.)The planners of the trade center site originally envisioned that Block56 would be part of the new Liberty Park, withSt. Nicholas Church at its west end. The ramp tothe underground roadways was to be on the north sideof Liberty Street.Plans now call for the ramp to be on the southside. That permits two-way traffic on Liberty Street and separateswhat will be a heavily used ramp from the memorial.But the trade center site is an interlocking puzzle. No planningproblem can be solved without creating another one. To accommodatetrucks and buses, the ramp entrance will need a greatdeal of headroom; so much that it will force theconstruction of a 20-foot earthen mound, or berm, in themiddle of Liberty Park.This berm could overwhelm the new church and loom over thesouth end of the memorial plaza. On the other hand,if it were creatively conceived and designed, it might offera fine vantage from which to view the memorial.Before any of that happens, however, the Milsteins will almost certainlyseek compensation for the three-and-a-half years -- and counting --in which they have been deprived of access to theirproperty.Just how much compensation remains to be seen. They have alreadyturned down a $30 million offer from the development corporation.(Last week, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Developmentapproved the corporation's plan to spend $44.5 million to acquirethe whole site, including the Milsteins' property.)The Milsteins are also interested in a land swap. It wouldnot take much imagination to conclude that their sights areset on Battery Park City, which is controlled by astate authority. They have already developed four apartment buildings there:Liberty Court, Liberty House, Liberty Terrace and Liberty View.""All options are on the table,"" Rampe said.
Gretchen Dykstra, the city consumer affairs commissioner, whopreviously led the redevelopment of Times Square, was named Thursdayas president and chief executive of the foundation charged withraising more than $500 million for a memorial and twocultural buildings at ground zero.The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation was created in December toraise money and run the memorial and the cultural buildings,which include a performing arts center and museum. Its board,which includes David Rockefeller, Robert De Niro,Barbara Walters and MichaelD. Eisner, is expected eventually to take over many ofthe responsibilities of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp., which isoverseeing the rebuilding effort at ground zero.""It's important, it's historic, it's unique and it's doable,"" Dykstra, 57,said of her new job in an interview at thecorporation's offices near ground zero. She said she was confidentthat it would not be hard to drum up financialsupport -- ""not for this event, not for this purpose.""""We've got to get moving,"" she said, adding that the foundationmembers had ""already begun to lay the groundwork.""At a news conference at the trade center site after thefoundation's second board meeting Thursday, John C. Whitehead, the chairmanof the development corporation, said the foundation began its fund-raisingeffort about two weeks ago and had already received largefinancial commitments. He said that by large gifts he meantpledges of $10 million to $25 million.Dykstra was selected from about 12 candidates, Whitehead said, because ""shehas all the qualities we were looking for in apresident.""Dykstra said she would start in her new post next month.She will face the challenge of balancing the competing concernsof the parties involved at ground zero, including city andstate officials, families of those who died in the Sept.11 attacks, downtown residents, real estate developers and big-name architects.That may be what she had in mind Thursday when shesaid it was important ""to make sure the process ofgetting there also makes us proud.""""There are a lot of players,"" she added, ""a lot ofpressures.""Plans call for the performing arts center to be shared bythe Joyce Theater, which presents dance, and the Signature TheaterCompany, an off-Broadway company. The museum is to be sharedby the Freedom Center, a nascent organization that plans tofocus on human rights exhibitions, and the Drawing Center, whichpresents drawing shows in SoHo.But prospects for all four groups remain murky given that thedevelopment corporation has yet to say how much it willcontribute toward the groups' construction and operating costs and howmuch they will have to provide.The corporation has delayed its announcement of a design of theperforming arts center, by the architect Frank Gehry, citing complicationsrelated to fitting both the Joyce and the Signature intoa single building with limited space.Whitehead spoke of the performing arts center as part of a""second phase"" with a separate fund-raising goal of ""roughly $200million""; the first $500 million will cover the memorial, amemorial center and the museum component, which includes the FreedomCenter and Drawing Center. The development corporation later said the$200 million figure was uncertain until a design was completed.The corporation also has delayed releasing a design of the museumbuilding by the Norwegian architecture firm Snohetta, citing details stillto be resolved. In addition, the design of the memorialitself has been complicated by the fact that three differentarchitectural firms are involved.Born on Staten Island and raised in Philadelphia, Dykstra received herbachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin and a master'sin education and an honorary doctorate from the Bank StreetCollege of Education.
As the focus at ground zero has suddenlyveered to the Freedom Tower and the rough-and-tumble blame gameinvolving its security redesign, the most vocal members of apowerful constituency -- the Sept. 11, 2001, families -- haveseized the hour to be heard above the growing clamorof politicians, developers, architects, cultural administrators, community advocates and otherLower Manhattan stakeholders.Family members of the 2,749 World Trade Center victims, and otherinterested parties, have until 5 p.m. Friday to formally expresstheir concerns about the memorial's evolving design. That witching hourofficially halts the period of public commentary on a newround of amendments to the reconstruction effort's originally approved environmentalassessment.September's Mission and several other family groups have objected to manyof the announced amendments, among them reducing the number ofpedestrian ramps into the memorial to two from four. Theysay that this would re-create the claustrophobic experience of fleeingfrom the Twin Towers, and that it would pose ahazard if the projected 2,000 visitors per hour had toexit in an emergency.At least eight of the dozens of Trade Center groups haveblitzed hundreds of families with e-mail messages encouraging them to""Make Sure That the Families' Voices Are Heard,"" as oneof the entreaties put it.""We feel it's now or never,"" said the executive director ofthe World Trade Center United Family Group, Anthony Gardner, whosebrother, Harvey Joseph Gardner III, died in the north tower.""People are putting egos aside, and we've come together again,because we feel the memorial concerns are being ignored. Originallythe memorial was the heart of the site, and nowit's getting less and less important.""The founder of September's Mission, Monica Iken, whose husband, Michael, diedin the south tower, said that ""everyone is talking aboutthe Freedom Tower, but the memorial is all that manyof us will have of our loved ones, and ithas to be done right.""Kevin M. Rampe, the president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation,which is overseeing the project and the public-comment process, saidof the changes that ""the reason the number of rampswas reduced from four to two was that our consultantstold us that was the best way to provide securitythere.""Beyond that, he said, the importance of the Trade Center memorialhas been undiminished. And, he added, some of the familycritics were using the environmental-comment period ""as an opportunity torehash issues that have been out there since the beginning.""Some of the family groups insist on direct access to theTrade Center bedrock at the tower footprints, considering it sacredground that offers the only connection to their loved ones,since the remains of 42 percent of the victims --including those of Iken's and Gardner's relatives -- have notbeen identified. Current plans appear to require family members totraverse the spaces occupied by tourists and by graphic exhibitsabout the attack.""We have plans that will allow people to have access tobedrock and the columns separately,"" said Michael Arad, the architectwho designed the memorial. ""We have met with the familiesevery step of the way,"" he said, ""and we willcontinue to.""Other design criticism from family groups centers around the streetwalls --or heights of buildings facing the streets -- which, accordingto the proposed site changes, could be as high as150 feet, a prospect that could be ""forbidding and unwelcoming""to pedestrians, Iken said, ""and could detract from the memorial,shadowing it.""To Rampe, though, ""the streetwall height is exactly the same asacross the street at the World Financial Center.""""This was an aesthetic decision,"" he added, ""to make it correspondwith surrounding architecture.""Arad said, ""We are trying to give the memorial quadrant astrong definition, so it can be a counterpoint to thedevelopment around it.""Important elements of the memorial design are now under intensive studyin Richmond Hill, Ontario, just north of Toronto. There, aconsultant to the memorial-design team has constructed a full-scale mockupof one corner of one of the voids. Water troughsat the upper level empty into a pool below, ina test of one of the most critical elements ofthe memorial: the walls of water that will cascade downall four sides of each enormous void. Architects are experimentingwith ways to reduce noise, splashing, freezing, blowing and clogging.The public commentary process that ends Friday is made mandatory notonly by New York State environmental law, but also bythe Department of Housing and Urban Development, which has awarded$2.78 billion in grants to the Development Corporation for therebuilding effort.The Development Corporation has the authority to choose among the commentsit receives -- some 400 arrived by Thursday -- andthe power to enact the changes it sees fit. Thepublic-comment process ""is not a meaningless exercise,"" Rampe said, pointingout that the original plan was altered in many respects,including the access to bedrock and the preservation of TradeCenter remnants at the towers' footprints.The family members are highly diverse, and some said that noneof the disparate and sometimes fractious Sept. 11 groups couldspeak for all the families in regard to progress atground zero. ""We never thought it would be smooth sailing,and I think that a lot has been accomplished onthe site,"" said Paula Berry, a member of the FamiliesAdvisory Council. ""On the whole, the LMDC has done anincredible job, and they have made great effort to betransparent.""But Frederic M. Bell, executive director of the New York Chapterof the American Institute of Architects, echoed charges of someof the family activists in saying that the development corporation""has not put out enough public information for the publicto weigh in.""""The LMDC garnered input early on,"" he added, ""but that hasdiminished, and there is not enough public discourse on howthe project has evolved."" His organization has filed an entryin the public-comment process.Rampe has rejected any extension of the public-comment period, as somefamily groups requested. But to Bell, ""The comment period endswhen people stop commenting. So the comment period never ends.""In keeping with that reality, some family members are also takingissue with long-known aspects of the project plan, including theprominence of the cultural buildings that, they say, encroach onthe memorial.""We've ended up with a memorial that's underground, with a museumthat's hovering over the site,"" said Mary Fetchet, the foundingdirector of Voices of Sept. 11, who lost her son,Bradley, in the south tower.Families are also concerned that visitors will be confused by theInternational Freedom Center. ""You're going to think that's the 9/11museum,"" said Edie Lutnick, executive director of the Cantor FitzgeraldRelief Fund. Because the program planned for the center willnot be purely commemorative, some say it does not belongthere.She and others suggest moving the cultural institutions into the basesof the commercial buildings on the site.""You've got 10 million square feet of unrented office space,"" Lutnicksaid. ""Put it there."" The development corporation has said thisis not under consideration.Fetchet said she would urge Gov. George E. Pataki to ""takea leadership role and scrutinize what's being done to thememorial.""""If the memorial fails,"" she added, ""the governor fails.""
Uncertainty is looming large at Ground Zero asplans to heal the scars of Sept. 11, 2001 facenew setbacks and revisions.The Freedom Tower meant to rise from the World Trade Center'sashes will be redesigned because of security concerns, officials saidthis week. Plans for a memorial for the terror victimsalso will likely undergo many changes.This comes amid slowed construction, the resignation of a leading developmentofficial, bickering over design and continuing questions about whether somuch new office space can be filled in lower Manhattan.Some groups representing victims' families, who faced a Friday deadline tosubmit public comments on proposed memorial changes, blame government officialsand developers for rushing the rebuilding.""The memorial has taken a back seat to the commercial interests,""said Anthony Gardner, a board member of the Coalition of9/11 Families whose brother, Harvey, was killed in the attacks.The coalition opposes many proposed changes, including reducing the number ofpedestrian ramps into the memorial from four to two.""They're going to be recreating that claustrophobic sort of environment thatwas going on during the attack as people were descendingthe stairwells,"" Gardner said.Changes to the Freedom Tower could be even more extensive.The skyscraper was envisioned as a twisting 1,776-foot spire of glitteringglass and steel, its form evoking the Statue of Liberty'ssilhouette.But the building is going back to the drawing board, Gov.George Pataki said Wednesday, responding to security concerns from theNew York Police Department. One of the worries expressed lastmonth was that the building would be too close tothe street and vulnerable to a truck bomb attack.""I have no doubt that (architect) David Childs will come upwith yet another magnificent design that will once again inspirethe nation and serve as a fitting tribute to freedom,""Pataki said.A first look at that new design, which should still reachthe same patriotic height, could be released in several weeks,development officials said.The security concerns will likely push back the tower's completion dateto at least 2010, a year later than first planned.The emergence of these security issues so recently -- the tower'sdesign was unveiled in December 2003 and the cornerstone laidon the last Fourth of July -- has led tofinger-pointing by government officials, with some expressing surprise over thepolice concerns.Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., while praising Pataki for acting to getthe project back on track, had said a day earlierthat the rebuilding was ""losing steam.""""A culture of inertia has infected downtown redevelopment and our cityin general, making large public projects like this one nearlyimpossible to complete,"" he said. ""We seem to be losingour way.""Last month, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. suspended plans to build a$2 billion, 40-story headquarters at the site. The state scrappedplans for a nearby traffic tunnel that concerned the company,but the building's future remains in limbo.The planned Freedom Tower and the nearby 7 World Trade Center,which is almost complete, lack major tenants.Adding to this, Kevin Rampe, president of the Lower Manhattan DevelopmentCorp., which oversees the rebuilding effort at the World TradeCenter site, announced on Monday his resignation effective later thismonth. Rampe has said his departure was long planned andunrelated to the current redevelopment issues.Schumer warned that continuing delays could put federal funding for thearea at risk.He added that while security concerns need to be taken seriously,""the Freedom Tower cannot become a barricaded, windowless fortress --a dark and uninviting presence in a neighborhood that desperatelyneeds the shops, people and bustle unique to this greatcity.""""The Freedom Tower is more than a building to anchor lowerManhattan,"" he said. ""It is a statement of American resolve.""
Sometime it's hard to believe that Michael Aradis still in the picture.Bit by bit, elements of his original design for the WorldTrade Center Memorial have been whittled away, whether because oflogistical realities at ground zero (the memorial will be builtabove PATH train tracks), client demands (the Lower Manhattan DevelopmentCorp. is calling the shots), the many other interests involved(the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, whichowns the site; victims' families; downtown residents) or the assortedarchitectural cooks (three other firms).For example, Arad included no trees in his original design, whichwas chosen in January 2004 after a competition. The memorialjury expressed a desire to make his design more green,so he teamed up with the landscape architect Peter Walker.Now Arad is fending off a veritable forest at thesite and dealing with how the trees might impinge onthe memorial below them.Arad originally designed four ramps leading into and out of thememorial. Now there are two.His reflecting pools were not centered in the footprints of thetwin towers. Now they are.Two considerably more experienced architectural firms are taking part in theprocess: Peter Walker & Partners and Davis Brody Bond. HandelArchitects is also involved; Arad, now 35, joined the firmlast year to give himself institutional backup.Some planning and design experts marvel that Arad has not beencompletely marginalized or discouraged. ""He may be crumbling internally, butI think he's shown surprising maturity for his tender years,""said David J. Burney, the commissioner of the New YorkCity Department of Design and Construction and an architect himself.In a telephone interview yesterday, Arad was cautious in fielding questionsabout the current state of his design. (Joanna Rose, thedevelopment corporation spokeswoman, was in the room on speakerphone.) Askedwhether he was satisfied with the two ramps, Arad didnot respond. His partner, Gary Edward Handel, piped up, ""We'renot happy about every decision that's made, but we trustthe process.""Arad would say only that he was keeping his eye onthe finish line. ""My role in this is to bethe advocate for the memorial,"" he said. ""That is whatI do every day in this project.""To be sure, the conflicts over the design of the memorialhave not brought the architects to a standoff or theprocess to a standstill, as occurred when David Childs andDaniel Libeskind fought over the design of the Freedom Tower.Indeed, even as the Freedom Tower has become a big questionmark at ground zero in terms of what it willlook like and when it will be finished, the memorialis proceeding apace. Groundbreaking is expected early next year foran opening on Sept. 11, 2009.The party line is that people are working through their differencesand that those differences will make for a better finalproduct. ""There's a healthy dialogue and differing opinions,"" said KevinM. Rampe, president of the development corporation. ""I think that'sbeen great. Each brings their unique experience.""Walker is largely concerned with ""how the landscape interacts with thememorial,"" Rampe continued, adding that J. Max Bond Jr. ofDavis Brody Bond ""brings an enormous wealth of practical experienceabout engineering considerations, and Michael brings the vision.""Despite the varying levels of professional experience, Rampe said Arad hadmanaged to hold his own. ""Michael has earned a levelof respect,"" he said. ""I don't think one feels theycan overwhelm the other. They come with different perspectives, differentskills, and ultimately they will end up with good results.""The architects largely echoed that assessment. Bond said, ""The design benefitsfrom the interaction of the three different firms and theconsultants.""Walker said, ""Sometimes it's heated, sometimes it works very smoothly.""Arad said: ""It's not about this being a harmonious process. It'sabout it being a productive process.""But some of those involved say Arad was unprepared for theharsh realities of the process -- above all, how muchhis plan would have to change in light of engineeringconcerns and competing priorities.""We viewed the competition as the beginning of the evolution,"" saidDouglas Findlay, a partner in the Walker firm. ""He oftenviews it as the end.""Walker offered, ""I'm glad I didn't deal with something of thismagnitude at the beginning of my career."" He added, ""Thisis the process to end all processes.""Arad said he was by no means naive about the logisticsinvolved; in addition to the PATH tracks, a chiller plantlies under the site. ""The technical complexity of the siteis challenging,"" he said. ""But our team has a thoroughgrasp of the issues.""At the same time, Arad said, his vision for the siteremains clear. ""I know exactly what I want to seehere, and it's just a matter of advocating for thememorial,"" he said. ""I think people understand that and appreciateit.""When he won the design competition, Arad was only 34 andhad never done anything nearly so big before, let aloneat one of the most scrutinized architectural sites in thecity's history.After earning his master's degree from Georgia Tech's College of Architecturein 1999, Arad spent three years at Kohn Pedersen FoxAssociates, where he worked on projects like Espirito Santo Plazain Miami and Union Station in Hong Kong. Then hejoined the New York City Housing Authority, where he wasworking on two new police stations when his memorial designwas selected.Before becoming an architect, Arad spent three years in the IsraeliArmy. And he is no stranger to politics or diplomacy:his father, Moshe, served as Israeli ambassador to the UnitedStates from 1987 to 1990 and as the ambassador toMexico from 1983 to 1987.The memorial is expected to cost $350 million, including the MemorialCenter, a separate area being designed by Davis Brody Bondthat is to include artifacts from the Trade Center. Thearchitects are still in the thick of resolving each ofthe design details that will make up the memorial, fromhow much noise and splash the waterfalls will give offto how people will find the names of their lovedones inscribed in stone around the two pools.Most recently, for example, the parties involved have clashed over thenumber of ramps; the decision to have two instead offour was clearly made over Arad's objections.According to Findlay, the best architects are the ones who ""areable to deal with these obstacles and turn them aroundto make them into something, make them a virtue --not to resist it,"" and to keep their eyes open""for the great ideas that flow by.""That is not to say that an architect should say yesto everything if he believes it compromises his design, Findlaysaid. He cited his own objections to the Port Authority'sproposal to place a huge vent in the middle ofthe park.Arad's initial design did not address questions like crowd circulation orsecurity. An information center called Memorial Hall has been addedbetween the two pools.Walker said the experience had deepened his respect for Maya Lin,who designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington. ""I've neverhad the appreciation for her that I have now,"" hesaid. ""How she got through it and got something thatis really good and still has got her head abouther -- I think about it all the time.""But Findlay emphasized that the ground zero memorial raises different challenges.""This site is where the event occurred,"" he said, adding,""The memorial is essentially people's grave site.""With this in mind, the architects are working on the spiritualaspect of moving through the memorial -- going from thebustle of the secular city into the park into thesobering memorial and up again into the living world.""Imagine walking around a five-acre oak woodland,"" Findlay said. ""You willbe drawn into it. You can see across the plainand see the plain go away. You can hear thewaterfalls, and at night it glows. So in all waysthe voids have been made very important.""Nonetheless, some of the Sept. 11 families are unhappy with howthe memorial is shaping up. Some want the names ofthe victims listed alphabetically, or by tower, or by policeor fire department affiliation. Some even want the remains ofthe World Trade Center victims to be moved to thesite from the Fresh Kills landfill. ""You can't call thesepeople heroes and leave their remains in a garbage dumpin Staten Island,"" said Edie Lutnick, executive director of theCantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund, set up to aid families ofvictims who worked for the financial services concern at theWorld Trade Center.As for creative tensions, some architects say they are to beexpected. ""You put capable and strong-willed design firms in aroom and there is a discussion of options,"" said FredricM. Bell, executive director of the New York chapter ofthe American Institute of Architects. ""That's how it should be.""""I think Michael is a very reasonable and smart and flexibleperson -- not the type to say, 'I'm taking mymarbles and going home,""' he said. At the same time,Bell added: ""He does have strong ideas. Winning a competitionis incredibly empowering. That's the card that Michael has.""
Gov. George E. Pataki will appoint his chiefof staff to take control of the rebuilding effort inLower Manhattan, aides to the governor said last night. Hewill also use hundreds of millions of public dollars tojumpstart the fund-raising effort for the Sept. 11 memorial atthe World Trade Center site, they said, and will pushahead the timetable for producing a redesign of the FreedomTower office building.Pataki, in a speech Thursday to the Association for a BetterNew York, is to announce that John P. Cahill, oneof his closest aides, is set to leave Albany tospend the majority of his time working on the complexmultibillion-dollar redevelopment project, and that he will be charged withthe power to bring together the disparate agencies and agendasat the site, the aides said.They spoke on the condition of anonymity to preserve relationships withinterested parties who had not yet been briefed about thechanges.Among Cahill's first priorities will be to lure Goldman Sachs &Co. back to Lower Manhattan. The investment bank recently scrappedplans to build a new $2 billion headquarters across thestreet from the former World Trade Center site.Pataki, the aides said, will also energize the fund-raising effort forthe planned memorial by earmarking $300 million in federal moneyfor construction and maintenance of the complex, which includes astudy center, underground exhibits and twin reflecting pools marking thefootprints of the twin towers. Finally, Pataki will announce thata new plan for the Freedom Tower, which was deemedvulnerable to a terrorist attack, will be released in onemonth.Pataki's latest plans amount to his starkest and most public acknowledgementthat the large and emotionally delicate effort in Lower Manhattanhas suffered serious setbacks in recent weeks. The governor iseager not only to mollify the executives at Goldman Sachsbut also to quiet a growing chorus of critics --from U.S. Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., to business leadersand real estate experts -- who have complained that theproject seems derailed.Pataki has long hoped that a rebuilt and prospering downtown wouldbe the cornerstone of his legacy. His third term expiresnext year, and he has not announced whether he willseek a fourth.""The purpose of the speech is more than an update,"" oneaide to the governor said. ""The purpose is to restoreconfidence in the rebuilding process."" The aide added that thelesson that was learned in recent weeks ""is that anythingcan hit a snag, and we don't want things outof control again.""To that end, Pataki has assigned Cahill to coordinate the workof each government agency and private institution and to serveas the final word from Albany. Cahill, a lawyer whoearly in his career handled some real estate and developmentprojects, once served as the head of the State Departmentof Environmental Conservation and has long been one of thegovernor's senior policy advisers.All those involved at ground zero will report to Cahill, includingthe president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the agencyset up in the aftermath of Sept. 11 to runthe redevelopment. Kevin Rampe recently announced that he would resignas president of the development agency, and his successor hasnot yet been named. The Port Authority of New Yorkand New Jersey, the Battery Park City Authority and theMetropolitan Transportation Authority will also report to Cahill.He will also be the governor's liaison to the city andto private business.A spokesman for Goldman Sachs expressed pleasure. ""We have had anexcellent relationship with John Cahill,"" the spokesman, Peter Rose, said.""We think he is the right person to provide leadershipto bring the variegated parts of downtown together.""Pataki's speech will likely be greeted with some relief as wellas skepticism, given that some three and a half yearshave passed since the trade center attacks. ""Timetables and speecheshaven't gotten us anywhere so far,"" said Assembly Speaker SheldonSilver, who was briefed on the plan Wednesday night.The families of the Sept. 11 victims were one of Pataki'skey constituencies as the new plan for the site wasdeveloped, and the governor is to make a gesture tothat group as he pledges public dollars to build andpreserve the memorial.The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation was created in December toraise money and run and preserve the memorial and thenearby cultural buildings. But the foundation, which garnered some privatecontributions, has also fallen short of the initial expectation ofits founders.It only recently named a president and began fund-raising in earnest,and is far short of the hundreds of millions ofdollars needed to proceed. Pataki will announce that $300 millionof the remaining $800 million in Lower Manhattan Development Corporationfunds would go toward the memorial, with $200 million servingas a challenge grant for private donations.
Down at the Battery, booklets called ""Attack onAmerica,"" ""Tragedy"" and ""Tragedia"" sell for $6, or two for$10. The pictures make the sale, and the pictures areall the same. They tell a story exhaustively told inforests of newsprint, books, government reports, made-for-TV movies and aBruce Springsteen record.Inside the World Trade Center PATH train station, the Lower ManhattanDevelopment Corp. has commissioned a project to tell the storyagain, an exercise in populism that takes an approach oppositeto that of the photo booklets. The project, a storytellingbooth set to open Tuesday, depends on words with nopictures, rambling impressions instead of searing images, the cadence ofvoices in place of printed text.In part, it is a stopgap for Reflecting Absence, a six-acrememorial scheduled to open in 2009 at the site ofthe terror attack of 2001.The storytelling idea has won tacit approval from survivors' groups, nomean feat in light of the controversies attached to memorialplanning at the city's grimmest tourist attraction.""People have stories to tell; they need to start doing itnow,"" said Monica Iken, the founder of a group calledSeptember's Mission and a critic of some memorial plans. ""Childrenare getting older, people are ready to express themselves."" Ikenlost her husband, Michael, a bond broker, at the WorldTrade Center.The development corporation paid $350,000 to build the booth and pledgedan additional $150,000 to operate it through December. There areplans to install listening stations later on. The project isan extension of work by Story Corps, which began anoral history archive at Grand Central Terminal two years ago.In a sparse recording studio at Vanderbilt Hall and laterin mobile booths traveling the country, 3,000 people have conducted40-minute interviews of friends and family members, keeping a copyand leaving another for submission to the Library of Congress.The founder of Story Corps, David Isay, said many participants hadbeen using their sessions to memorialize dead relatives, so thenotion of a booth devoted to stories of Sept. 11seemed a natural fit.""There's only one thing that's important about the site or September11, and that's that people were lost,"" Isay said. ""Nothingelse matters.""For the Sept. 11 project, Isay invited survivors and relatives ofvictims to make the first recordings at Grand Central. Heexpects others will go there, too, instead of to theWorld Trade Center.So far, about 50 people have made Sept. 11 recordings, butcancellations have been common, Isay said. Michael Kuo, 29, whosefather was killed on Sept. 11, canceled an appointment inDecember.""You can set an appointment for December 12, an arbitrary day,and you don't feel it, you don't feel sharp, youcan't explain it,"" Kuo said.For those who have made recordings, the experience has been emotionallycomplex. Keith Meerholz, 39, who escaped from one of thetowers, sat for an interview conducted by his wife, Grete,with help from a Story Corps worker.""I never thought this would be a good thing for peopleto hear,"" Meerholz said. ""I always thought they would think,'Why did that son of a bitch get out andnot my person?""'The speakers set their own paths. The Leinung family's interview makesno mention of Sept. 11 for the first quarter-hour; theMcNeal family brings it up almost at the start ofthe recording.Because the booth will be open to everyone, not all ofthe recordings will be on the same emotional plane. EdwardLinenthal, a professor of history at Indiana University and theauthor of ""The Unfinished Bombing: Oklahoma City in American Memory,""said that policy allowed Isay to avoid some tough choices.In Oklahoma City, he recalled, memorial planners had to decide whohad been in enough danger to be considered a survivor.""It allows for a tremendously rich, complex collective memory,"" Linenthal said.""It also attracts, not so positively, people who would seekto attach themselves to an important moment in history.""Mary Marshall Clark, director of the Oral History Research Center atColumbia University and a co-coordinator of the unrelated Sept. 11,2001, Oral History Narrative and Memory Project, said the booth'svalue would depend in part on what solace it bringssurvivors. On that score, she said, the location was notpromising.""Ground zero is by its very definition a place of destruction,of the end of life,"" Clark said. ""It's inviting themto re-enter the void, so there should be someone thereafter the interview.""Isay said members of his staff call families after interviews.The notion of speaking at the trade center site appeals toKuo, who canceled his session last winter. He has anew appointment for July 28, another arbitrary day when hemight or might not feel like talking.""I think it's right to do it at the World TradeCenter site,"" Kuo said, ""because that's where the spirits are.""
In the ever fiercer fight over a year-oldplan to build a home for the Drawing Center andthe International Freedom Center alongside the World Trade Center memorial,some relatives of 9/11 victims called on Monday for afund-raising boycott.""We urge you to not donate to the World Trade Centermemorial until the IFC and the Drawing Center are eliminatedfrom the memorial plans,"" said ""An Open Letter to theAmerican People."" The letter appeared on a Web site, TakeBack the Memorial, until questions arose over how many ofthe 14 relatives' groups that were signed to the letterhad approved the use of their names.Despite that withdrawal, critics of the cultural plan -- including twomembers of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation, which ischarged with soliciting contributions -- said the freedom center hadto be removed before they would support the use ofpublic money for the overall project. Opponents have objected inadvance to what they say will be an anti-American biasto the center's offerings, a charge that the center hasjust as strongly rejected.""We owe it to the American people or anyone else whowants to donate to tell them what they're paying forand not mislead them,"" said Debra Burlingame, a foundation boardmember and one of the letter's authors. She said financingfor the memorial would be intermingled with that for thebuilding at Fulton and Greenwich Streets that is intended tohouse the International Freedom Center and the Drawing Center.The assertion was disputed by Lynn Rasic, the vice president forpublic affairs at the foundation. ""The first fund-raising efforts aredevoted to the memorial and the museum dedicated to Sept.11,"" she said.""It's unfortunate and wrong to block efforts to make sure thatour nation and the world remember those we lost duringthe attacks,"" Rasic said.Asked whether it was a conflict of interest for board membersto urge prospective donors to withhold support, Rasic said anypotential conflicts would be reviewed by the governance committee.Monica Iken, a board member and the founder of September's Mission,which supports the development of a memorial, said she hadnot approved the use of her group's name on theletter. ""I never signed off on anything like that,"" shesaid yesterday.""I have an obligation to fund-raise for the memorial,"" she added.But Burlingame said her objections were in line with her fiduciaryresponsibilities as a board member. ""You can't go out tothe public and say, 'We're raising $500 million,' and nottell them they're building on the same site a buildingso large it will dwarf the memorial,"" she said.Lee Ielpi, another member of the foundation board, is also vicepresident of the September 11th Families Association, which was listedas supporting the open letter.""I'm fully comfortable asking Americans who shared our sorrow and cameto help us in the worst of times to helpus honor our dead and the sacrifice they made,"" hesaid. ""I am not comfortable asking them to play arole in a political, economic or ideological passion play whoseending has yet to be written. I believe the freedomcenter is a bad idea.""Robert D. Shurbet, the founder of Take Back the Memorial (takebackthememorial.org),said that the open letter was a draft that hadbeen ""posted prematurely"" and that the link to it wasremoved ""pending final approval"" by the relatives' groups.As to the larger issue of the cultural organizations, Stefan Pryor,the president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp., said officialswere having ""continuing conversations with the two institutions regarding theirresponse"" to concerns raised by Gov. George E. Pataki. OnJune 24, the governor asked for an ""absolute guarantee"" thatprograms on the site not denigrate America or offend victims'families.Eric Foner, the DeWitt Clinton professor of history at Columbia University,resigned from the freedom center's committee of scholars and advisersearly this month, after a letter from the center toPryor that tried to address those concerns. News of hisresignation was reported on Saturday in The New York Post.Alternative locations for the Drawing Center on and off the tradecenter site are already being explored
The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July29:Somewhere in the ill-conceived campaign to ""take back the memorial"" atground zero, false impressions have managed to triumph over facts.This week, Debra Burlingame, a board member of the WorldTrade Center Memorial Foundation, and others called for a boycottof fundraising for the memorial until the International Freedom Centerand the Drawing Center have been banished from ground zero.She argues that money for the memorial will be intermingledwith funds for the cultural building that is supposed tohouse the Freedom Center and the Drawing Center. This isboth misleading and harmful to the memorial itself. The WorldTrade Center Memorial Foundation has pledged that its first priorityis to build the memorial and create an endowment forit. Private donors are free to specify how they chooseto have their money spent.The attacks on the International Freedom Center -- and, more broadly,on the cultural component of Daniel Libeskind's master plan --make it all too easy to forget the existence ofa Memorial Museum that is devoted wholly to the eventsof 9/11. Opponents of the Freedom Center, like Burlingame, claimthat the Memorial Museum will be dwarfed by the culturalcenter. In fact, they overstate the size of the Snohettabuilding, which is being scaled back for other reasons, andthey have exaggerated the floor space allotted there for theInternational Freedom Center. They also make it sound as ifthe Memorial Museum, which at 50,000 square feet is largerthan the public spaces in the Whitney Museum, is somehowan afterthought relegated to the basement. It will be builtunderground, but that is because the 9/11 families asked tohave access to the bedrock and to what remains ofthe foundation of the twin towers. To argue over thesize of these two spaces is to assume that emotionalpower is solely the result of square footage. It isalso to forget the profound effect that going to theroots of the World Trade Center will have on mostvisitors.But this is not really a campaign about money or space.It is a campaign about political purity -- about howpeople remember 9/11 and about how we choose to readits aftermath, including the Iraq war. On their Web site,www.takebackthememorial.org, critics of the cultural plan at ground zero offera resolution called Campaign America. It says that ground zeromust contain no facilities ""that house controversial debate, dialogue, artisticimpressions, or exhibits referring to extraneous historical events."" This, tous, sounds un-American.
New York Governor George Pataki joined victims' family members, survivors, and rescue workers Thursday in laying out a timetable for two temporary Sept. 11 memorials.One project is an oral history booth called ""StoryCorps."" Set up in the PATH station at the World Trade Center site, it will have audio recordings featuring memories of loved ones and the events of Sept. 11. The memorial will open to the public on July 12.The permanent memorial, part of the trade center site redevelopment, is due to open in 2009. Governor Pataki said it wasimportant to have temporary memorials to help the victims' loved ones and help tourists understand what happened there.""You come down here any time, any day and there are people looking down at the site and imagining in their minds what happened on Sept. 11,"" said Pataki. ""Now they can still do that, but then they'll be able to go across the street to the tribute center and be told the actual story by people who understand it and by people who were there on that day.""The other project is the Tribute, set to open in March next year at a now-vacant storefront and basement at Liberty Street.The center will house a gallery, exhibits and education programs, and will offer walking tours around the trade center site.The interim memorials will serve as outlets for information about the attacks until the permanent memorial is built.
","In May, 2005, Governor Pataki announced he would earmark $300 million to jumpstart fund-raising for the September 11 memorial. He also planned to push ahead the timetable for redesign of the Freedom Tower office building. By doing so Pataki admitted the effort to build the memorial had suffered serious setbacks. Families of the victims criticized the design, including the cultural building: Too large; the streetwalls; too high. They objected to changes: Two pedestrian ramps instead of four. The original design was being whittled away. Goldman Sachs suspended plans to build a $2 billion 40-story headquarters at the site. ",The World Trade Center memorial project has bogged down while negotiations over issues of condemnation and imminent domain are hashed out. Design revisions have further complicated the project. Family members of 9/11 victims expressed displeasure with many of the proposed amendments to Arad's design. They believe the memorial has taken a backseat to commercial interests and have called for a fundraising boycott. New York's governor announced he will appoint his chief of staff to take control of the rebuilding effort. He will also use public funds to jumpstart the fundraising effort. A temporary memorial will open on July 11. ,"Elements of the original design for the WTC memorial have been whittled away by logistical realities, client demands and concerns expressed by family members of the 2,749 WTC victims. The Freedom Tower meant to rise from the ashes will be redesigned because of security concerns. The proposed reduction of four pedestrian ramps to two raised safety concerns. The memorial itself is expected to cost $350M including the Memorial Center - a separate design. Governor Pataki assigned his chief of staff to coordinate the work of each agency and institution involved in the redevelopment of and around the memorial. ","Spring and early summer brought more controversies to the WCT Memorial. A new Foundation CEO was named. One last parcel of land still was needed. Various interest groups were battling over aspects of the ground zero area including the International Freedom Center, the Drawing Center, the Performing arts center, and the Freedom Tower office building. The families of victims were fighting commercial interests. The Foundation's money drive is falling short, but the governor has promised some public funds. Elements of the original design are continually being altered. Two spot-gap memorial projects were begun in June and July. "
D0939,D0939-A,"Ten people were killed and more than 100 injured Wednesday when two commuter trains slammed into each other after one of them hit a car left on the lines by a suicidal man, police said.A murder investigation was launched as the death toll rose following the horrific early morning crash involving three trains and a sports utility vehicle in the heavily-populated Los Angeles suburb of Glendale.Rescuers were picking through the mangled wreckage of the trains that collided with an explosive crash just after 6:00 am (1400 GMT) after one of them derailed as it ploughed into the abandoned vehicle.""We have 10 fatalities so far and well over 100 injured,"" Glendale Police Chief Randy Adams told reporters, adding that the probe into the accident had turned into a homicide investigation.""This whole incident was started by a deranged individual who was suicidal,"" he said announcing that the depressed driver, identified as Juan Manuel Alvarez, 26, was unhurt and was in custody.The driver allegedly manoeuvred his Jeep onto the tracks, where it became stuck, and waited for a train to end his life, according to Adams and other police officials.  ""He was intent at that time on taking his own life but changed his mind,"" Adams told reporters.    ""He exited the vehicle and stood by as a southbound Metrolink train struck his vehicle, causing the train to derail and strike the northbound train,"" the police chief said.After hitting the car, the packed rush-hour train, which was bound for Los Angeles' Union Station, jumped its tracks and jack-knifed into the path of an oncoming commuter train heading in the opposite direction. One of the stricken trains then side-swiped a stationary freight train that was parked on a side-track in the area, knocking it over, officials said.Carnage ensued. ""It sounded like thunder,"" said Karen Mendoza, an employee at a nearby wholesale store who called emergency services when she heard the accident.Some passengers had to be cut from the wreckage, which was strewn over a wide area, while others were forced to jump to safety from the burning upper decks of railway carriages that caught fire in the impact. At least 89 people were rushed to hospital as a hundreds of rescuers and convoys of ambulances flooded the crash scene. Some 200 people, mostly walking wounded, were examined by medical staff at the scene as they prioritised treatment for the wounded, firefighters said.Passengers were tossed around the inside of their trains and some had to jump from the upper decks of the wreckage, eyewitnesses told reporters.Most of the injuries suffered by victims were ""crush-type"" wounds similar to those that occur in car crashes, said Carol Meyer of the Los Angeles County emergency medical services. Many of the patients had head, chest and abdominal injuries, she added.The Los Angeles Police Department declared a citywide tactical alert that allows commanders to keep officers on the job beyond the end of their shifts, in order to help with the rescue and crowd control operations.Meanwhile the driver of the vehicle that sparked the incident was expected to be charged with murder, police said. ""You don't put your car on the track and put yourself in harm's way and all these passengers in harm's way,"" said Los Angeles Sheriff Lee Baca, one of whose deputies was among the dead. ""This is a complete outrage.""
A man intent on committing suicide left his caron a railroad track in Glendale near downtown Los Angeles Wednesday,where it set off a collision that derailed two commuter trains,killing at least 10 people and injuring nearly 200, authorities said.Police arrested a man who they said would be charged with homicidein the crash that left train cars mangled and seared. Debris includingseat cushions, bloody towels and luggage discarded by fleeingpassengers littered the area.A southbound commuter train heading to downtown Los Angeles hit theJeep Grand Cherokee parked on the tracks, said Glendale Police ChiefRandy G. Adams. The train then apparently crashed into a northboundMetrolink commuter train, and a stationary Union Pacific freight trainwas hit and knocked off the tracks, officials said. The investigationwas continuing.Adams identified the suspect as Juan Manuel Alvarez, 25, ofCompton, adding that he had attempted suicide before.Alvarez, who was identified by witnesses at the scene, was detainedthere and appeared to have superficial self-inflicted injuriesunrelated to the crash.Distraught and remorseful, Alvarez told police he had left thevehicle and watched the derailment, Adams said. The suspect was put ona suicide watch.Alvarez was held on 10 counts of murder, Adams said, althoughformal charges are lodged by the district attorney's office. Alvarez,who will be 26 on Feb. 26, had previous drug arrests, Adams said.It is too early to say exactly what those charges will be, DistrictAttorney Steve Cooley said, but they could include multiple counts ofmurder, with special circumstances based on the number of deaths andnature of the crime. Key to the legal case, Cooley said, ``is theintent of the individual when he drove onto the tracks.''Adams said of Alvarez: ``I think his intent at that time was totake his own life, but changed his mind prior to the train actuallystriking this vehicle. He exited the vehicle and stood by as thesouthbound Metrolink train struck his vehicle, causing the train toderail and strike the northbound train.''Glendale Mayor Bob Yousefian said that Alvarez ``kind of ran, triedto hide, but because of his previous injuries, he got apprehended.''When asked why Alvarez was in Glendale, the mayor responded, ``Hecame to Glendale to commit suicide.''A National Transportation Safety Board team was headed to thescene. The Glendale Police Department was leading the criminalinvestigation, with Los Angeles Police Department and the Los AngelesCounty Sheriff's Department assisting.The 6 a.m. crash set off minor fires and diesel fuel spills asrescuers rushed to the scene about four miles north of Los Angeles.``This is unbelievably tragic,'' Sheriff Lee Baca told reporters atthe scene. ``It is a complete outrage as far as transportation safetyis concerned.''At a joint news conference with Los Angeles Police Chief WilliamBratton and Glendale's Adams, Baca said he was especially upsetbecause one of the dead was identified as Deputy James Tutino, a23-year veteran of the Sheriff's Department. He was aboard thesouthbound train, heading to work.Three LAPD employees were hospitalized, and one was unaccountedfor, Bratton said.By 10:30 a.m. the death count hit 10. Fire officials said 123people were treated and transported to 13 area hospitals. About 60people were treated at the scene and released.(Begin optional trim)Glendale Memorial Hospital treated 13 passengers. Eight weretreated and released. Two were listed in critical condition, includingTheresa Gillen.Her sister, Leah Gillen, 35, waited at the hospital for news abouther sister, who works for Para Los Ninos, a social-services agency indowntown Los Angeles.Gillen lashed out at Alvarez.``I'm angry that someone would be so selfish and would destroy thelives of so many people,'' Leah Gillen said. ``These people were justgoing to work.''(End optional trim)Hundreds of tons of wreckage from the commuter trains lay strewnacross the area. Officials reported traffic delays.More than 300 firefighters combed through the derailed trainslooking for trapped passengers in the predawn darkness. Asfirefighters cleared each car, they marked the side, giving the carsan eerie look as they formed a twisted zig-zag pattern next to thetracks.At least five passes had been completed through the trains by 9a.m., when officials said the focus shifted from rescue to recovery.Officials said the trains usually carried 200 to 250 passengers.The top speed is 79 mph, although the trains were believed to betraveling at less than the maximum.David Morrison, 47, an attorney, was heading to downtown LosAngeles on his regular morning commute. He said he got on train 100 at5:19 a.m. in Simi Valley.``I heard the crash. It sounded like the train was draggingsomething across the tracks,'' he told the Los Angeles Times. ``Therewas a violent lurch and everything came to a stop.''He said the passengers fled amid the smell of diesel fumes.Goddard Paialii, 53, of Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, acommunications electrician for the city of Los Angeles, said heboarded the train and rode in the lead car. He was upstairs and saidhe was trying to nap, listening to his iPod.After the crash, the train ``appeared to be dragging whatever ithit. At that point, I just braced myself. Computers, seat pads,briefcases were flying all over. There was lots of smoke in the car.''But the exodus remained orderly.Cathie Fransen, 57, was riding with her friend Ken Milds, 55, inthe middle car. Fransen said she has taken the train regularly for 121/2 years and was in the aisle seat, second floor, middle car. Shedoes community relations for IBM in Glendale.``It was very terrifying. We had seconds to think about what wasgoing on,'' she said.The entire wreck of all three trains was contained between a graywarehouse and the brick wall of a Costco warehouse store.All along the ground, large metal pieces of the side of the trainand gray upholstered seats were scattered like discarded foodwrappers. On the train cars, windows gaped or were shattered in theirframes.``We heard a loud boom and the building shook,'' said Jenny Doll,30, a Costco clerk.Employees took fire extinguishers from the store shelves and ranoutside to help.Inside the store, passengers were processed by officials trying toaccount for everyone on board. Once done, the commuters filed out andsat on white picnic benches in front of a snack stand.An hour after the crash, crews worked on the wreckage as about 50passengers waited nearby.Staff writers Peter Hong, Jill Leovy, David Pierson, Wendy Thermosand Erica Williams contributed to this report.
At least 10 people were killed and more than 180injured Wednesday when a commuter train derailed after crashing into acar parked on tracks north of Los Angeles, then sideswiped an oncomingtrain, knocking it off its rails.Authorities said the SUV, a Jeep Cherokee, was left on the tracksby an apparently suicidal man, who jumped from the vehicle momentsbefore the southbound commuter train plowed into it.It was the worst train wreck in the United States since March 1999,when an Amtrak train hit a truck and derailed in Illinois, killing 11people and injuring about 100. In the deadliest train wreck in recentyears, an Amtrak train plunged off a railroad bridge near Mobile,Ala., in September 1993, killing 47 people.The SUV was hit shortly after 6 a.m. Pacific time by a southboundMetrolink train, which then went off the rails and started a deadlychain reaction, authorities said.After derailing, the commuter train, which was being pushed by itsengine, struck a Union Pacific locomotive parked on a side track,knocking it onto its side, fire department officials said. Thecommuter train, en route to Union Station in Los Angeles from thewestern suburb of Moorpark, then buckled, sideswiping a passingnorthbound train that was headed toward Burbank.Diesel fuel in the locomotive caught fire as a result of the crash,and flames spread to parts of the wreckage before firefightersextinguished them.The driver of the SUV, identified as Juan Manuel Alvarez, 25, ofCompton, Calif., was taken into custody, and police said he would becharged with homicide. Further information was not available. Theysaid the abortive suicide attempt did not involve terrorism.``This is a complete outrage,'' Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Bacaangrily told reporters at the scene of mangled rail cars and smokingwreckage in the suburb of Glendale, north of downtown Los Angeles. Hesaid the driver would be held accountable.``You don't put your car on the track and put yourself in harm'sway and all these passengers in harm's way,'' Baca said. Among thedead was a deputy in Baca's department who was riding the southboundtrain to work. In a light drizzle, rescue workers paused to salute theflag-draped stretcher carrying the body of Deputy James Tutino as itwas removed from the wreckage.``This whole incident was started by a deranged individual that wassuicidal,'' Glendale Police Chief Randy Adams told a news conference.``I think his intent at that time was to take his own life, but (he)changed his mind prior to the train actually striking the vehicle.''Just hours before maneuvering his car onto the tracks, Alvarez hadtwice tried to kill himself, slashing his wrists and stabbing himselfin the chest, police said. When those attempts failed, they said, hegot into his car and headed for the tracks behind a Costco store.Several train passengers said they saw Alvarez jump from his SUVjust before the southbound train plowed into the vehicle, Adams said.Approximately 250 people were aboard the two commuter trains travelingin opposite directions at the beginning of the morning rush hour.Rescue workers initially thought Alvarez was a victim of the trainwreck when they found him wandering near the scene, bleeding from hiswrists and chest. But he was arrested after saying he was the driverof the SUV that was struck by the train.``I'm sorry, I'm sorry,'' he muttered as he walked around the crashsite, authorities said.Alvarez was taken to USC Medical Center for treatment of hisself-inflicted wounds, and police moved to book him on 10 counts ofhomicide. Adams described him as ``upset, remorseful butcooperative.'' The police chief said Alvarez has a criminal recordinvolving drugs.The force of the crash hurled passengers down the aisles and intotables as the rail cars twisted and turned before finally coming torest. At least one train car caught fire.Authorities said 123 people were taken to 15 hospitals in theregion and that about 40 were in critical condition. About 60 peoplewere treated at the scene and released.Branigin reported from Washington.
A man whom police described as deranged andbent on suicide abandoned a light truck on a heavilytraveled commuter rail track here early Wednesday, causing a violentwreck involving three trains that left at least 10 peopledead and nearly 200 injured.The fierce collision at 6:02 a.m. left rail cars toppled andcrushed like oversized toys and sparked immediate fears among LosAngeles-area police that the derailment was a terrorist act. Acounterterrorism command post was set up near the crash site,but authorities determined within an hour that the disaster wasalmost certainly the work of one troubled man.Two hours after the crash, the rain-spattered scene between a Costcostore and a warehouse still reeked of diesel fuel. Thetracks were covered with tons of twisted metal and litteredwith rail car seats, suitcases, briefcases and clothing. A bicyclelay on its side and the gravel rail bed wasstained with oil and blood.Rescue workers arrived quickly and were aided by Costco employees whopulled injured passengers from the smoking wreckage. More than 120people, dozens of them with serious injuries, were transported to15 area hospitals.""People were screaming, one lady was crying, people were moaning, allkinds of painful noises,"" said Richard Mendevil, who was onhis way home to Santa Clarita from Los Angeles' UnionStation in the northbound Metrolink train, when it was hitby a southbound train that had derailed after hitting thelight truck and an idle Union Pacific work train.Glendale police said that Juan Manuel Alvarez, 25, of the LosAngeles suburb of Compton, drove around barriers at a gradecrossing and then up the Metrolink commuter rail tracks, wherehis Jeep Grand Cherokee became wedged between the rails.He apparently changed his mind about killing himself, abandoned the vehicleand watched the crash, the Glendale police chief, Randy G.Adams, said.Adams said that before driving onto the tracks Alvarez cut hiswrists and stabbed himself in the chest, inflicting superficial wounds.He was treated for his injuries and taken into custodyand will be charged with at least 10 counts ofmurder, the chief said. He said the crash was causedsolely by the actions of the suspect. He and otherlaw enforcement officials expressed dismay and anger at what theycalled a preventable man-made disaster.""I think his intent at that time was to take hisown life, but changed his mind prior to the trainactually striking this vehicle,"" Adams said. ""He exited the vehicleand stood by as the southbound Metrolink train struck hisvehicle, causing the train to derail and strike the northboundtrain.""He said that Alvarez was cooperating with authorities and had acknowledgedcausing the wreck.""He was very distraught and upset when he realized he causeda major disaster,"" the chief said. Alvarez is in jailand under suicide watch, he added.Steve Cooley, the Los Angeles County district attorney, said he woulddecide by the end of the week what charges hewill bring against Alvarez.Metrolink is a commuter rail system serving five counties in SouthernCalifornia since its formation in 1992. About 40,000 people ridethe double-decker trains every day, officials said. The two trainsthat crashed on Wednesday typically carry between 230 and 300people on weekdays.Wednesday's crash was the deadliest train accident in the United Statessince March 15, 1999, when an Amtrak train hit atruck and derailed near Bourbonnais, Ill., killing 11 people. Acrash in Graniteville, S.C., earlier this month ruptured a chlorinetank, leaving nine people dead and 234 injured.The National Transportation Safety Board has sent a team to investigate.People on the train and in the neighborhood near thetracks saw Alvarez as he ran away from his vehicle.Slowed by his knife wounds, he was arrested quickly, policesaid.(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)Witnesses and survivors described a horrific collision that upended several double-deckerrail cars and toppled a heavy diesel Union Pacific locomotivesitting idle on a side track.""I heard a noise. It got louder and louder,"" Diane Brady,56, a passenger from Simi Valley, told the Associated Press.""And next thing I knew the train tilted, everyone wasscreaming and I held onto a pole for dear life.I held on for what seemed like a week anda half, it seemed. It was a complete nightmare.""One injured man trapped in the wreckage scrawled a note inhis own blood on a seat cushion, according to RexVilaubi, a Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman. He wrote ""Ilove my kids"" and ""I love Leslie"" using the heartsymbol, Vilaubi said. He said he did not know theman's name.(END OPTIONAL TRIM)Mendevil, who was in the second car of the northbound train,said the collision came with no warning. ""I was onthe second floor walking down the aisle and saw thelights of the oncoming train and watched it pass andthen I was thrown up in the air, landed ona table and rolled off onto the floor,"" he said.""The train tilted sideways and the lights flickered and wentout.""He said as he got up from the floor he sawa fire on the tracks and a man with bloodstreaming down his face staggering alongside the listing rail car.Mendevil said that although he was ""pretty much in panic,""he pried open a door and helped a woman outand away from the train.Mendevil, 25, was interviewed in the parking lot of the Costcostore that became a command center and triage station forthe crash. He was wearing a tag around his neckgiven to him by paramedics to keep track of theinjured. He was treated at the scene and sent home.Mendevil said as he walked away from the wreckage, he sawthe tailgate of a truck and a wheel and concludedthat the train had hit a car or truck. ""Igot as far away as I could because I wasworried about an explosion,"" he said.Costco workers attended to the injured and used carts that usuallyhaul plywood to carry the injured to ambulances when paramedicsran out of gurneys. The store provided food and waterfor the hundreds of fire and rescue crews and mediaworkers who descended on the crash site in the dampgloomy dawn.Firefighters went through the wreckage five times with dogs and listeningdevices before determining that all the passengers had been accountedfor. Heavy equipment was then brought in to begin toclear the tracks, a process that will take several days,officials said.(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)Among the dead was Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy James Tutino,47, a 23-year veteran of the department, who was commutingto downtown Los Angeles from his home in Simi Valley.Two other sheriff's deputies aboard the train were injured.""This is a complete outrage as far as traffic safety isconcerned,"" Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca said. ""When someindividual parks his vehicle on the tracks that is causefor serious, serious alarm.""(END OPTIONAL TRIM)Mayor Bob Yousefian of Glendale called on federal transportation authorities toeliminate all grade crossings, which are responsible for scores ofaccidents and suicides each year around the country.Federal investigators said they did not know the exact number ofmotorists who have committed suicides at rail crossings. The policewho investigate rail accidents are taught to look for signsof suicide, such as an absence of skid marks immediatelybefore the crossing, indicating that the motorist saw the trainand tried to stop. Suicides more commonly involve pedestrians whowalk in front of trains than those who park carson the tracks, investigators say.Wednesday's crash was the third fatal accident involving Metrolink in thepast three years. In January 2003, a Metrolink train smashedinto a truck and derailed, killing the motorist and injuring32 train passengers. In April 2002, a freight train plowedinto a stopped Metrolink train, leaving three passengers dead and162 injured.David Solow, the chief executive officer of Metrolink, described how thedisaster unfolded. Metrolink train 100, a four-car train being pushedby a locomotive, was southbound from Moorpark to Los Angelesand approaching the Glendale station at 6:02 a.m. when itsfront car hit Alvarez's Jeep.The front car, a so-called cab car, has a compartment inthe front for the engineer when the locomotive is inthe back. The rest of the two-story car carries passengers.Because Alvarez's truck was wedged between the rails and not sittingat a grade crossing, it became an ""immovable object,"" Solowsaid, vaulting the front car of the train into theair and causing the cars behind it to twist ontheir couplings and fold in on each other like anaccordion.The out-of-control train struck an idle Union Pacific work train ona track just west of the Metrolink rails, knocking thelocomotive on its side. The train had numerous cars fullof gravel and was preparing to go to Santa Barbarato repair tracks damaged in the recent California rainstorms.After striking the Union Pacific train, the southbound train slammed intoan oncoming Metrolink train, number 901, northbound from Los Angelesto the San Fernando Valley.Trains on the line can travel as fast as 79 mph,but the two trains involved in the crash were probablygoing slower because the southbound train was approaching the Glendalestation and the northbound train had just left it, Solowsaid. He said that the exact speeds, the various pointsof impact and the overall force of the collision wouldbe determined by National Transportation Safety Board investigators.Solow said that Metrolink and most other passenger trains were designedto withstand a collision with a light vehicle stopped ata grade crossing. The cab car in the front ofthe southbound train has a reinforced frame that is designedto deflect or destroy vehicles parked at level grade crossings.""Normally at a grade crossing the car is smashed to smithereensand the train stays on the track,"" Solow said. ""Butthis car was wedged between the tracks and the onlyway for the cab car to go was up.""(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)He said that Metrolink is involved in three to five gradecrossing accidents a year, some involving attempted or successful suicides.""If someone wants to commit suicide,"" Solow said, ""I don't careif it's on a highway, a railroad or jumping offa bridge, none of us is going to stop that.It's one of the banes of our existence.""
Until Wednesday, Juan Manuel Alvarez was living theaverage life of an obscure and troubled man.He has an arrest record for cocaine, a turbulent relationship withhis estranged wife and a restraining order to keep awayfrom her and their two children.But then in the early morning darkness of Wednesday, Alvarez introducedhis troubled life to the world when he drove hisJeep Cherokee onto the commuter railroad tracks of Glendale inmetropolitan Los Angeles, killing at least 10 people and injuringabout 200 more.Ronald Watson came to the Glendale Police Station on Wednesday morningto find some information on his wife.He was told she was taken to the hospital and released.""I heard what happened this morning, and I thought it can'tbe her,"" said Watson, visibly relieved. ""It was. Thank Godnothing serious happened to her. She's home now. She's goingto be mad I didn't pick her up.""Alvarez had apparently meant to kill himself, investigators said, but changedhis mind when he saw the train barreling down onhim. When he could not get his vehicle off thetracks, he ran. He was in police custody Wednesday evening,said to be distraught but cooperating.""He's carrying a lot of baggage and talked about killing himself,""said Sheriff Lee Baca of Los Angeles County. ""When thetrain came, he got scared, he couldn't go through withit. He left his car there and instead of killinghimself, he killed many innocent people.""Alvarez's motive for wanting to kill himself, according to investigators, appearsto be that his estranged wife, Carmelita, would not lethim see their two children. The couple had separated threemonths ago, and she obtained a restraining order against Alvarezabout two months ago, the police said.Alvarez's sister-in-law, Maricela Amaya, told Telemundo TV that he had recentlytried to see his boy and threatened to kill himself.""He was having problems with drugs and all that and wasviolent, and because of that he separated from her,"" Amayasaid in Spanish. ""A few other times he went aroundas if he wanted to kill himself.""After the bodies had been cleared from the wreckage, law-enforcement officialsbegan to wonder if Alvarez might have killed his family.But, Mrs. Alvarez was tracked to a modest home inthe north section of Compton. A man standing outside thefamily's home, who described himself as a relative, said Mrs.Alvarez and the children were uninjured.According to investigators, Alvarez spent the evening before slashing his wristsand even stabbed himself in the chest, but the woundswere superficial.And so sometime Wednesday morning, Alvarez, 25, drove himself to theGlendale tracks, near the City of Los Angeles boundary andparked his car. He decided not to go through withit, but the vehicle got stuck between the tracks, thepolice said. Alvarez ran to safety and watched the carnagehe had caused, witnesses told the police.""He came to Glendale to commit suicide,"" said Bob Yousefian, mayorof Glendale, a normally uneventful city of 210,000 just northof Los Angeles City Hall. ""He kind of ran, triedto hide, but because of his previous injuries, he gotapprehended.""Chief Randy G. Adams of the Glendale police said he was""very confident"" that he had the right man, going byAlvarez's own admissions and witnesses on the train who sawhim run.""This whole incident was started by a deranged individual that wassuicidal,"" Adams said.Alvarez is likely to face at least 10 counts of murder,the chief said.
A ""deranged"" man abandoned his SUV on railroadtracks when he aborted a suicide attempt, authorities said, andthen watched as a Metrolink commuter train slammed into it,setting off a spectacular three-train collision that left at 11least dead and more than 180 injured Wednesday.Shortly after 6 a.m., commuters were thrown flying through the carsand trapped beneath tons of twisted metal as the double-deckrail cars toppled and flames danced around them.After hitting the Jeep Grand Cherokee on the tracks, the frontof southbound Train 100 hurtled into a Union Pacific locomotiveparked on a parallel track, while its other cars sweptinto oncoming northbound Train 901.Even before a massive emergency response effort was launched, nearby residentsand workers rushed to help passengers, many of them dazedand bleeding as they stumbled from the wreckage.""This is a complete outrage,"" Los Angeles Sheriff Lee Baca saidin angry comments at a news conference. ""The people whoride trains to Los Angeles deserve better than this.""That an individual would deliberately put their car on tracks, causea train derailment, affect the lives of hundreds of peopleand, in effect, kill people, this is a tragedy wewill certainly mourn.""Among the nine men and two women killed were a uniformedsheriff's deputy headed to work, several government employees and oneof the conductors.Juan Manuel Alvarez, 25, of Compton, the driver of the JeepGrand Cherokee, was found near the wreckage and arrested onsuspicion of homicide.Glendale Police Chief Randy Adams said Alvarez -- who officials saidhad tried to commit suicide earlier by slashing his wristsand cutting himself -- watched the chaos after fleeing hisvehicle.""This whole incident started by a deranged individual who was suicidal,""Adams said. ""He was very distraught and upset and realizedhe caused a major disaster.""Passengers described being hurled from their seats as the trains collided,and then rescuing one another from the wreckage in thepredawn dark. A fire broke out, and 5,000 gallons ofdiesel fuel spilled.""People just flew out of their seats and hit the walls,""said Bernan Castro, a Washington Mutual insurance agent who hadboarded the southbound train in Burbank.""We smelled the fire. ... It was engulfing (one fourth of)the train. It just looked like a war zone. ...There was blood everywhere.""Doug Parsons of Northridge also was aboard the train, headed forhis job at the Metropolitan Water District downtown.""We were right on schedule. Right in here, we usually passanother train. We heard some gravel fly and then ...the big boom. The car in front of us wentsideways. ... That's when we saw the other train.""Tracy West of Northridge, who suffered serious cuts to her rightleg, described a nightmarish scene:""I just remember flipping and flipping and flipping. ... My feetwere over my head. People were hurt, dripping with blood.You just offer to help anyone you can.""On the northbound train, headed from Union Station to Burbank, NelsonGoyzueta said he watched the rail car in front ofhis rock back and forth on the track before topplingto the side.""The third one did cartwheels -- it was way off tothe side,"" said Goyzueta, who was on his way towork with other employees of Senior Aerospace in Burbank. ""Itwas mayhem.""The National Transportation Safety Board and other government agencies sent investigators.The tracks run next to a big-box shopping center anchored bya Costco, where triage was set up and store workershelped with the rescue.Hundreds of firefighters descended on the scene within minutes of the6:02 a.m. crash, dousing flames, spraying foam on the fuelspill and extricating wounded from the cars.Firefighters described a horrific scene where bloodied passengers were helping eachother off the train and responders could hear the criesfor help.""It was unbelievable -- all you could think was, 'Go inand get those people out,' "" said firefighter Oscar Stokes,38. ""There was a lot of blood.""Rescuers used extrication tools to cut out those trapped in thewreckage and shopping carts from Costco to wheel victims totriage until more gurneys arrived.Dogs were brought in to search for survivors and cameras toprobe dark crevices in the wreckage.Dozens of paramedic trucks formed single-file lines to quickly load andcarry the wounded to 16 area hospitals.They treated and transported 123 victims, including 70 in critical condition.They assessed and released 60 others at the scene.""It had to be the worst multicasualty incident I've been to,""Los Angeles Fire Capt. Rick Godinez said. ""It was adevastating sight.""We could see walking wounded. We knew we had a prettytraumatic situation.""Elected officials expressed outrage at the tragedy but praised the rescueeffort that reached across jurisdictions to handle the crisis.""Words can't describe, when you look into the cars, the violenceof the crash,"" Mayor James Hahn said at a newsconference. ""It's a miracle that more people didn't die.""Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger sent his own condolences and those of hiswife, Maria Shriver, to the victims and survivors.""We want to thank the 300 firefighters that rushed to thescene and are doing good action to rescue the injuredpeople from the wreckage. And we also want to thankthe medical personnel who tended the injured.""Glendale Mayor Bob Yousefian urged the federal government to provide fundingto enhance grade crossings, while expressing shock and sadness atthe tragedy.""Nothing of this magnitude has happened (before) in Glendale,"" he said.""He just came to Glendale to commit suicide. And wehave no idea why he did this.""
Authorities believe Juan Manuel Alvarez drove his JeepGrand Cherokee around the rail crossing barrier and onto theMetrolink train tracks at Chevy Chase Drive in Glendale about6 a.m. Wednesday.His intent was to kill himself, but he changed his mindafter his SUV got stuck between the tracks in anarea slightly away from the grade crossing.At 6:02 a.m., the three-car Train 100, headed from Moorpark toUnion Station, with the locomotive in the rear, crashed intothe SUV. Instead of knocking it out of the way,the train's front cab car probably lifted up over theSUV, said Metrolink's CEO Dave Solow.Because the SUV was ""lodged on the tracks,"" it was unableto move, he said.""It got wedged under the train. At grade crossing, it wouldhave been easier. He would have been pushed off.""The commuter train folded up like an accordion -- its frontcar ramming into the Union Pacific freight train's locomotive onthe track to the west, toppling it to its side.The remaining cars collided with northbound Metrolink Train 901, whichwas on the track to the east after leaving theGlendale Station.The Union Pacific train was a work train for track maintenance,with two locomotives and about 12 cars filled with ballastor gravel.Metrolink trains in that area can go up to 79 mph,but officials said they were likely going slower with theGlendale station nearby.Solow said there's little Metrolink can do to prevent suicide attemptson its tracks.""One of the banes of our existence is we can't stopsomeone who wants to commit suicide.""
Los Angeles County prosecutors on Thursday charged aman with 11 counts of murder, one for every personwho died in a violent three-train wreck that they sayhe caused by driving his Jeep onto commuter railroad tracksin a botched suicide attempt.The charges include the special circumstances of using the train, whichcould make the man, Juan M. Alvarez, eligible for thedeath penalty. Alvarez may also face federal charges in thetrain derailment.He was to stand in court on Thursday afternoon and answerthe charges, but his appearance was postponed until Friday becausehe was too weak from wounds he made to hiswrists and chest before the wreck, prosecutors said.Steve Cooley, the Los Angeles County district attorney, said in aninterview that he would not decide whether to seek thedeath penalty until the case was thoroughly reviewed by hisoffice.His voice firm with anger, Cooley called Alvarez a self-centered manwhose aborted suicide attempt on the Glendale railroad crossing ledto 11 deaths in the early morning darkness Wednesday. Another200 people were injured. The body of one man wasburned so badly it has yet to be identified.""Because this man was distressed, 11 people are dead from hisselfishness,"" Cooley said. ""They said he was not well enoughto appear today. Hopefully, they will patch him up sowe can get this case rolling.""Alvarez, 25, was being held in a special custody ward atan area hospital.As the diesel fuel dissipated at the crash site and theinvestigation became a clean-up operation, a clearer portrait of Alvarezemerged.According to investigators, Alvarez is an itinerant laborer with no fixedaddress. When detectives asked him to volunteer to a searchof his residence, Alvarez said he did not have one,that he had been bouncing from couch to couch sincehe had a falling out with his wife, Carmelita.She filed a restraining order against him two months ago, allegingthat he was prone to drug-induced hysteria. More than once,his wife said in papers filed with the court, hethreatened to kidnap the couple's children; a girl, 6 anda boy, 2. He threatened to sell his Jeep tobuy a gun, promising Mrs. Alvarez's brother, Ruben Ochoa, thathe would be the primary target of his anger, shesaid.Mr. Alvarez, 25, has a history of drug arrests and violence.He has been in and out of rehabilitation facilities overthe years. Increasingly, his behavior became more odd and paranoid,his wife said in court papers, and she said heaccused her of participating in pornographic videos.Mrs. Alvarez got an order of protection against him in December,forbidding him to see his children. Mr. Alvarez began tothreaten suicide to friends, investigators said. Late Tuesday evening orearly Wednesday, Mr. Alvarez cut his arms and stabbed himselfin the chest but the wounds were so superficial, heremained conscious. He drove onto the railroad tracks in Glendale,not far from the Los Angeles City line. Investigators believethat Mr. Alvarez wanted to die under the wheels ofthe train, but when the end approached he reconsidered. Withhis tire, apparently caught between the tracks, Mr. Alvarez jumpedout of the Jeep and ran.""He chickened out,"" said Sheriff Lee Baca of Los Angeles County.Two of Baca's employees died in the collision. ""He killedinnocent people but not himself.""On Thursday, the National Transportation Safety Board said it would notconduct a full investigation of the crash because it appearedto be the result of a criminal act.""We're not doing our standard investigation which would involve determination ofcause,"" said Paul Schlamm, a spokesman for the agency inWashington . ""We're taking a more limited role here.""He said the safety board would review data from recording devicesin the locomotives, including time, speed and the exact locationof the cars' breaking up. He said investigators would alsolook at the extent of destruction in the commuter carsand what might be done to improve chances for survivalin future accidents.The commuter train that struck the car on Wednesday had thelocomotive situated in the rear, pushing rather than pulling thepassenger cars. A federal study in 1996 showed that inthis configuration, the front car is exposed, putting passengers atparticular risk of injuries or death.Mayor James K. Hahn of Los Angeles called for a completere-examination of all commuter rail lines to see if furthersafety measures were needed or possible after the freakish outcometo the bungled suicide.
Juan Miguel Alvarez, charged with murder with specialcircumstances in the deaths of 11 Metrolink passengers, slashed andstabbed himself after seeing the horrific train crash he caused,sources close to the investigation said Thursday.Alvarez, 25, despondent over the breakup of his marriage, had plannedto kill himself when he drove his green Jeep GrandCherokee in the path of a Metrolink train, officials said,but he bolted from the vehicle at the last moment.As he watched, southbound Train No. 100 smashed into the SUVand derailed, then rammed a parked Union Pacific freight trainand collided with another Metrolink train heading north out ofUnion Station.As onlookers and emergency crews rushed to help those trapped inthe flaming wreckage, Alvarez walked to a female friend's homein nearby Atwater Village, where he slashed his wrists andstabbed himself in the chest, the sources said.""Now that we have done further investigation, we know the self-inflictedwounds were received after he placed the car on thetracks and after he fled from the scene,"" one sourcesaid. ""When paramedics responded, that's how we became aware ofhis location.""Alvarez appeared remorseful, sources said, making spontaneous statements about the crashto paramedics and law-enforcement officials who responded to the friend's911 call.Eleven people died and about 180 were injured in the crashat 6:02 a.m. Wednesday. Seven people remained in critical conditionon Thursday.Within hours of the crash, Alvarez was arrested on suspicion ofmurder. He is being held without bail at Los AngelesCounty/USC Medical Center jail ward, where he is being treatedfor the self-inflicted wounds.Alvarez was charged early Thursday with 10 counts of murder withthe special circumstances of multiple murders and murder caused bytrain derailment, an extremely rare charge. After the body ofan 11th victim was discovered, District Attorney Steve Cooley saidanother murder count would be added to the complaint.The special circumstances could make Alvarez eligible for the death penaltyif he is convicted, but Cooley said he hadn't yetdecided whether to pursue the capital charges.The Alvarez family retained attorney Eric A. Chase of the ChaseLaw Group in Studio City to represent him. Chase andfellow attorney Debra S. White said they expect Alvarez's arraignment,originally scheduled for Thursday, to be held Friday.In filing the charges, Cooley said he was unmoved by Alvarez'semotional state before the crash.""He's not going to engage my sympathy because he was despondent,""Cooley said. ""The special circumstances alleged could lead to thedeath penalty but only after a careful evaluation of allthe facts and circumstances that related to the particular incident.We're all aware of Mr. Alvarez's background.""But legal observers predicted Cooley will have a hard time gettinga conviction on the special circumstances allegations because he wouldhave to prove that Alvarez intended to kill people onthe train. Statements by law enforcement officials that the traincrash was the result of an aborted suicide attempt don'tsupport that notion, they said.""It suggests to me that he didn't have an intent tokill,"" said Elyn Saks, a professor of law, psychology andpsychiatry in behavioral sciences at the University of Southern CaliforniaSchool of Law.""On the other hand, just putting the car there on thetracks was extremely reckless.""Saks said prosecutors might do better to charge Alvarez with ""depravedheart"" murder, the equivalent of second-degree murder, rather than moreserious first-degree charges.Attorneys also said statements made by Sheriff Lee Baca, Los AngelesMayor James Hahn and others that Alvarez was ""deranged"" anda ""crazed individual"" will not help defense attorneys in apossible insanity defense to spare him a potential death sentence.James E. Blatt, a high-profile criminal defense attorney based in Encino,said it seemed obvious that Alvarez was mentally ill anddisabled, but that there was a much higher standard concerningan insanity defense.""He did have enough wherewithal to jump out of the wayof the train to preserve his life,"" Blatt said. ""Heappears remorseful. And at first blush, he appears to understandthe consequences of his actions.""As grieving friends and families mourned the deaths of their lovedones, city, state and federal investigators continued to comb throughthe massive pile of debris and twisted metal at thescene.""It's been an extremely long and difficult two days with therescue and recovery of victims in this tragic accident,"" Glendalepolice Sgt. Tom Lorenz said. ""All emergency personnel working throughthese tough times are not only trying to get victimsreunited with their loved ones, but at the back oftheir minds know they have fellow employees who were injuredor died.""We want to make sure we do a very thorough job.""The National Transportation Safety Board has assigned 10 investigators to assistthe Glendale Police Department.""They will spend the next few weeks looking at documenting differentaspects of the event like the crash-worthiness of the (rail)cars and survivability issues like how people were injured andwhat might be done to protect them better,"" agency spokesmanPaul Schlamm said.""We're trying to learn as much as we can from this.""
A 25-year-old man was arrestedfollowing Wednesday's commuter train collision that killed at least 10 people near downtown Los Angeles.Glendale Police Chief Randy Adams said Juan Manuel Alvarez, whointentionally parked his Jeep on the rail tracks and caused the train collision, will be facing at least 10 counts of homicide.A southbound commuter train from Ventura County struck the Jeepat about 6 a.m. local time and caromed into a stationary freight train locomotive before colliding with a northbound commuter trainfrom Union Station in downtown Los Angeles.At least 10 people were killed and hundreds were hurt in the crash that also disrupted morning rush hour commuter train traffic.Alvarez, who is on the suicide watch list, drove his Jeep Cherokee on the tracks, then changed his mind about taking his life and fled from the vehicle when the train was approaching.Adams said Alvarez had made some superficial attempts overnightto kill himself -- slitting his wrists and stabbing his chest -- and was treated for those wounds before being booked.According to police records, Alvarez has a previous arrest history, possibly involving drugs.""He has been cooperative and he has talked to our investigators,"" Adams said.Alvarez is accused of leaving a Jeep Cherokee on the tracks, causing the derailment of one train, which then crashed into another.
","Juan Alvarez left his car on a railroad track in Glendale CA. It set off a collision that derailed two trains, killed at least 10 people and injured nearly 200. Witnesses identified Alvarez and he was detained. He was distraught and put on suicide watch. Glendale police believed he intended to commit suicide but changed his mind. He was taken into custody and charged with at least 10 counts of homicide. Investigators felt Alvarez wanted to kill himself because his estranged wife denied him visits with his children. He was held on suspicion of murder in Los Angeles without bail. ","A man intent on suicide left his car on a railroad track in Glendale, California, where it set off a collision that derailed two commuter trains and killed ten people (later raised to eleven) and injured nearly 200. Police held Juan Manuel Alvarez on ten counts of murder and indicated that he had intended suicide but changed his mind and fled his vehicle before the train struck. Alvarez, who had self-inflicted superficial wounds, remained at the scene and was cooperating with police. He has a criminal record involving drugs and his wife obtained a restraining order against him. ",Juan Manuel Alvarez drove his SUV onto Glendale train tracks in a suicide attempt. When his SUV got stuck between the tracks he got out and left. A southbound Metrolink commuter train crashed into the immovable SUV and climbed over it. The front cab car rammed into an adjacent stationary Union Pacific work train and toppled it. The remaining cars jackknifed and derailed a northbound Metrolink commuter train. The accident and subsequent fire killed 11 and injured 200. Alvarez watched the crash then attempted suicide again by slashing his wrists and stabbing himself. He was arrested and charged with homicide. ,"A train crash in Glendale, California, on 26 January killed 11 people and injured close to 200, many critically. A southbound commuter train, pushed from behind by a locomotive, hit an SUV lodged on the tracks, then hit a freight train and a northbound commuter train. Police arrested Juan Manuel Alvarez, the driver of the SUV, who had jumped from the car just before the impact. At first, self-inflicted wounds on his wrists and chest led investigators to think that it was an attempted suicide. It was determined later that he got the wounds after he fled the scene. "

Prosecutors have decided to seek the death penalty against the man accused ofcausing a collision of two commuter trains, a crash that killed 11 people andinjured nearly 200.Juan Manuel Alvarez, 26, allegedly parked his Jeep on tracks in suburbanGlendale on Jan. 26, then abandoned the vehicle as a Metrolink train approached.The train crashed into the Jeep and derailed, slamming into an oncomingtrain.Glendale police have said that while it initially appeared Alvarez was trying tocommit suicide, the discovery of other evidence, including gasoline doused onthe sport utility vehicle, showed he was trying to cause thecrash.Alvarez has pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of murder and one count ofarson.Eleven members of the Los Angeles County district attorney's capital casecommittee agreed this week to use a rarely used ""train wrecking"" statute as oneof the special circumstance allegations against Alvarez, spokeswoman JaneRobison said Friday.She declined to discuss what led the committee to seek the deathpenalty.""We don't comment on any proceedings at the committee meetings,"" shesaid.Alvarez's defense attorney, Eric Chase, did not immediately return a telephonemessage requesting comments.
Juan Manuel Alvarez, the suicidal man accused ofkilling 11 people and injuring more than 180 when he parked his JeepGrand Cherokee in front of a speeding Metrolink train, appearedbandaged and shackled in court Friday as his lawyer argued that he wasthe victim of a ``lynch mob mentality.''Alvarez, 25, who could face the death penalty, has remained heavilysedated and under suicide watch at County-USC Medical Center since theaccident, according to defense lawyer Eric Chase.On Friday, he stood with a bowed head and muttered a quick ``yessir'' to court officials when asked if he agreed to postpone hisarraignment until medical and psychological tests could be performedon him.While Glendale, Calif.'s Police chief has described him as being``deranged'' and Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooleysaid his despondence is no excuse of leniency, Chase suggested toreporters that the severity of the charges against him were beingdriven by emotion.``I'm sensing a mentality out there that I almost want to call alynch mob mentality. But I'm hoping that that calms down,'' Chasesaid.Prosecutors charged that Alvarez intended to commit suicide butchickened out as a southbound Metrolink train bore down on him. Hetried to drive away, but the vehicle was stuck, and he leapt to safetyseconds before the train struck. The train derailed, and hit anotherMetrolink train and an idle freight train. The charges include specialcircumstance accusations of train wrecking and multiple murder, whichcould bring the death penalty.Meanwhile, railroad crews worked throughout the rainy day and nightFriday, removing mangled train cars and pounding temporary rails intoplace at the sight of the derailment. .``We want to have it up and running Saturday morning for freightservice and Monday morning for regular service,'' said Mike McGinley,Metrolink's director of engineering.Nineteen of the njured passengersremained hospitalized, four incritical condition.At Glendale Adventist Hospital, Louis McAleer, 39, was recoveringfrom knee and ankle injuries. An electrical supervisor for the LosAngeles County Sheriff's Department, the 39-year-old McAleer said hewas in the lead car of the train that struck the SUV abandoned on thetracks. McAleer was hurled about the car as it slewed off the tracksand struck two other trains.He said he often had imagined what it would be like if his trainderailed, but his imagination never came close to the reality.``It was so much worse,'' McAleer said. ``The abruptness, thesounds, the smells the quick impact. I'm lucky to be alive.''McAleer said he has strong feelings about Alvarez.``He should have just stayed on the tracks without his truck,''McAleer said. ``That would have fixed everything. I have no remorsefor him. What he did is just wrong. Leaving a car on the tracks sothat it derails a passenger train is just wrong.''On Thursday and Friday, two dozen Metrolink employees and about 60contractors removed debris from twisted and damaged railway tracks andhoisted derailed train cars onto the tracks for removal. One of thecars was hauled away by flatbed truck and stored as evidence for theGlendale Police Department.Crews also were working to tear up damaged rails and replace themwith temporary ones. About 400 feet of rail will be replaced andpacked into place with gravel. Until longer, permanent rails arere-installed a month from now, trains will have to slow to 35 mph atthe site. With permanent rails, trains can travel up to 70 mph.Workers also must repair a signal bridge.While the tracks are owned by the Metropolitan TransportationAuthority and maintained by Metrolink, Union Pacific uses them aswell.``The Union Pacific runs a fair amount of trains on this line, andthere is not an alternate route,'' Pederson said.Times staff writers Amanda Covarrubias, Richard Winton, Caitlin Liuand Patricia Ward Biederman contributed to this report.
It had not been a perfect marriage, but at timesit had been a good one. Juan Manuel Alvarez met Carmelita Ochoa whenthey were teen-agers, when they were members of a community dancegroup. She was pregnant with another man's child. He said he didn'tcare. He loved her and her daughter -- their daughter, he called her --anyway.They dated for two years before Carmelita asked him to marry her.Their wedding in 2000 was held Nov. 2, Dia de los Muertos -- the day ofthe dead, a traditional Mexican holiday. They had a son of their ownand moved to a small, tidy house owned by Carmelita's parents on aquiet street in Compton. Alvarez worked construction jobs to supporthis family. ``He was very good to me,'' his wife remembers.But a year ago, something in Juan began to change. He'd hurt hisleft arm on a job and couldn't work. He stayed home with the childrenwhile Carmelita worked as a waitress. He was depressed, Carmelitathought. He began to slip away, she said, taking drugs, talking crazy.A few months ago, his behavior became so erratic and threateningthat she threw him out of their house. She got a restraining orderthat prevented him from seeing his 6-year-old stepdaughter and3-year-old son. As she told a court in her oft-misspelled petition,``Juan Alvarez has been using drugs for a very long time, and hasstarted halusinating. He accusses me of being with other people, orrecording us or him in our bedroom with hidden cameras. He alsoaccusses me of doing porn videos with different people. He hastreatened me and says that my family members have introdused me to aboyfriend, wich is made up by him. He has treatened to kill thisperson that dosn't exist, and to my family members that he thinks hasintroduced me. He has treatened to do anything if I don't let him seeour kids.''Was Juan Alvarez delusional, or diabolical? Did he intend to killonly himself or many others? In the aftermath of an enormous tragedy,justice will hinge on the answers.Waiting on the TracksA light rain fell in the predawn dark on the morning of Jan. 26 asJuan Alvarez drove his green Jeep Cherokee through Atwater Village, aneighborhood straddling the Los Angeles-Glendale line near GriffithPark. At the railroad crossing on Chevy Chase Drive, police say, heturned sharply and drove along the tracks, stopping parallel to agiant Costco store. At that point, he allegedly turned the vehicle sothat its engine block was positioned across the tracks. Then, policesay, he waited.From the north, a commuter train filled with people on their way towork downtown bore down on the Jeep.Pushed from the rear by a locomotive, the train's lead car smashedinto Alvarez's vehicle and drove it down the track. First came theboom of the collision, then a scraping, groaning, metallic rumble asthe first of the passenger cars derailed, turned on its side and slidalong the gravel. Then came a second collision, this one as the frontcar plowed into a Union Pacific freight car parked on a siding. Theimpact knocked the 50-ton Union Pacific car on its side.The commuter train, Metrolink No. 100, came to rest in a ragged,jackknifed position, its cars splayed across two sets of tracks. Themetal exterior of the first car had been sheared open like a canhacked with a claw hammer.Now a second commuter train entered the chaos. In a freakish bit oftiming, Metrolink No. 901 came chugging toward the scene from thesouth just as the first chain-reaction collisions began. Thejackknifed section of No. 100 clipped No. 901's second car as itrolled past. This impact derailed 901's rear two cars. Inside 901'ssecond car, John Phipps, who had been dozing, was thrown violentlyforward. He hit something hard, which tore a gash in his head andslammed him into unconsciousness.For a few moments, an eerie silence settled over the scene. Themist fell on the crumpled cars and the people trapped and hurtingwithin.Then the cries of pain and shouts for help began.The chain-reaction crash of the Metrolink trains killed 11 peopleand injured 180. It was the worst train wreck of any kind in Americain six years, and one of the deadliest ever intentionally caused.The dead included office workers, government administrators, astock clerk and a cop. Julia Bennett, 44, was a clerk-typist with theLos Angeles Fire Department whose father and grandfather had beenfirefighters. Manuel D. Alcala, who was 51, was a maintenance workerat the county jail. A conductor on No. 100, Thomas M. Ormiston, was58, two years away from retirement after a career with SouthernPacific, Amtrak and Metrolink.Scott McKeown, 42, a telecommunications manager for the city ofPasadena, was a train buff who belonged to a local model-railroad cluband collected train whistles. According to news accounts of the crash,one of the victims profusely thanked the people, including workersfrom the Costco store, who rushed to the scene to pull him from thetrain. Police later identified that victim as McKeown.For law enforcement officials, the crash was both horrifying andpersonal. Among those killed was James Tutino, a 47-year-old LosAngeles County sheriff's deputy and father of four who was on his wayto work at the Men's Central Jail.For a while, as he lay pinned in the wreckage, Phipps thought hewould die, too. And so, in pain and isolation, he wrote one briefthought with the only instrument handy: the blood of his wounds. ``I(heart) my kids,'' he scrawled on the back of a seat. ``I (heart)Leslie,'' his wife's name.Juan Alvarez almost certainly would have died in the crash, too,had he stayed in the Jeep. But he did not. Moments before the trainstruck, according to Glendale police investigators, Alvarez scrambledout of the front seat and walked back to Chevy Chase Drive. Fromthere, he allegedly watched the ghastly scene unfold.At some point, perhaps before the crash, possibly after, Alvarezfound a pair of scissors and slashed his arms and chest. He walkedback to his apartment a few blocks away, covered in blood. Alarmed byhis injuries, his landlady called paramedics, who grew suspicious andsummoned police. Alvarez was arrested as he was being treated.Thefirst reports said Alvarez wanted to end his life on the tracks thatmorning but thought better of it and fled. Glendale Police Chief RandyAdams called Alvarez ``deranged (and) suicidal'' at a news conferenceafter the crash. Authorities placed Alvarez on round-the-clock watchin his cell.And that is the version of the wreck that Juan Alvarez's familystill believes.``He was there, and out of nowhere he basically saw a light,'' saysCarmelita Alvarez, who has visited her husband in jail. ``Not thelight from the train. He said he felt like there was a presence fromGod telling him to get away.''Sitting next to her, Beto Alvarez, Juan's cousin, adds, ``It wastelling him to get out. ... He felt like somebody physically pulledhim away.''Carmelita: ``He tried to move the car. But his car had a lot ofmechanical problems. It got caught and wouldn't move.''But investigators now think differently.Days after the crash, forensic tests revealed a dramatic new pieceof evidence: the presence of gasoline on the inside and outside ofAlvarez's crushed Jeep Cherokee. Glendale police, who are leading theinvestigation, say they have witnesses who saw Alvarez douse the carwith gas. They also say they have statements from Alvarez admitting asmuch.This sheds a new light on the original suicide theory. Alvarezwasn't trying to kill himself, says Sgt. Tom Lorenz, a policespokesman. ``He may have thought about committing suicide, but hisactions are not consistent with that,'' he said. ``When you'recontemplating suicide, would you light yourself on fire? How manypeople kill themselves that way? Why not lie down on the tracks? Whywould you walk away and watch the train hit your car?''The self-inflicted wounds on Alvarez's arms and chest, he said,``weren't life-threatening.''Police now think Alvarez's intention was to derail the train in themost spectacular fashion possible. The motive wasn't necessarilymurder, says Lorenz, but mayhem.And to what possible end?Lorenz has a ready answer: ``He was trying to gain the attention ofhis wife. He wanted her back.''Suicide AttemptLooking back on it now, Juan Alvarez's relatives say they could seeearly signs of his clouded mind.more 
Wednesday's deadly train derailment in Glendale has renewed concerns of trainengineers and safety experts that it is unsafe for locomotivesto push rather than pull train cars along a track,leaving passengers in lighter-weight ""cab cars"" most exposed in theevent of a crash.That was the case Wednesday when a Metrolink train smashed intoa Jeep Cherokee, with the train being led by a57-ton cab car and powered from behind by a locomotivemore than twice as heavy.""If a locomotive had hit that Jeep Cherokee, it wouldn't havederailed and hit another train, and you wouldn't have 11people dead,"" said Bob Tucker, a railroad industry consultant inAmarillo, Texas.Tim Smith, California state chairman of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineersand Trainmen, said the union has been complaining about thepractice for years.""We feel our engineers (in cab cars) are very vulnerable toinjury and death, and so are the passengers who sitright behind them. Cab cars tend to run into thingsand over things and derail, where locomotives tend to shovethings off the track,"" said Smith, who said the union'swarnings have gone unheeded.That's because regulators and passenger rail lines, including Amtrak and Caltrainin the Bay Area, believe the practice is safe.""There's no strong or clear evidence that indicates one method ofoperation is less safe than another,"" said Steve Kulm, spokesmanfor the Federal Railroad Administration, which issued passenger rail safetystandards in 1999. The cab cars in the Metrolink crashwere manufactured in 1993, before the regulations took effect.The Federal Railroad Administration does not keep statistics comparing injuries anddeaths in collisions in trains led by cab-cars versus thoseled by locomotives.But a 1996 administration study looking at the impact of ahead-on crash between a locomotive and cab car found thatabove 35 mph, occupants in the cab car likely wouldsuffer severe injury or fatality.The study also noted the concern that ""occupants of the relativelyexposed cab car, including the engineer, are vulnerable to seriousinjury or fatality in the event of a collision witheither a road vehicle at a grade crossing or withanother train.""Still, the configuration is commonplace for commuter rail lines, and hasbeen in use since the 1950s because it allows trainsto zip back and forth between destinations without using thetime and space it takes to turn the locomotive aroundor the expense of running a locomotive at both thefront and back of the train.With the locomotive in back, the engineer controls the train fromthe cab car, a modified passenger car.Caltrain spokeswoman Jayme Maltbie Kunz said the railroad has not hadproblems with the cab-forward, or ""push-pull,"" configuration.""We have seen no reduction in safety to our passengers operatingin a push-pull configuration,"" said Maltbie Kunz.She said cab cars struck a Coca Cola truck in 1999and the vehicle of a suicidal man in October andneither collision caused a derailment or serious injury to passengersor engineers. In the case of the soda truck, bottlesand cans flew through the windows of the cab carand pelted passengers.George Elsmore, head of railroad operations and safety for the CaliforniaPublic Utilities Commission, agreed that the train's configuration makes littledifference.""The relative safety between the two modes is practically identical ona crash-worthiness basis,"" Elsmore said in a Wednesday interview. Hesaid both cab cars and locomotives have similar federally mandatedcrash protection standards and devices mounted on the front todeflect objects.But that's not enough to assuage the fears of Berkeley residentPeter Hinckley, an Amtrak engineer for 30 years who conductstrains from Oakland to Bakersfield and Sacramento. He began operatingin push-pull mode about two years ago.""I'm surprised it hasn't happened years ago,"" he said of acrash like the one in Glendale.""I have hit heavy equipment, locomotive first,"" he said. In acab car, he said, ""we would have been all overthe landscape.""Hinckley said Amtrak is aware of the danger but will notmake changes.Amtrak spokeswoman Sarah Swain declined to respond, beyond saying the cab-forwardconfiguration is ""common practice on passenger railroads in general.""
Los Angeles -- The man suspected of causing the deadliest U.S.train wreck in six years was charged with murder Thursdayas the district attorney contradicted police and suggested the crashmay have been a calculated act, not the work ofsomeone insane or suicidal.The 25-year-old suspect, Juan Manuel Alvarez, was expected to be arraignedtoday on 11 counts of murder with special circumstances, meaninghe would be eligible for the death penalty if convicted.Alvarez has been in custody since Wednesday morning after, according topolice, he drove his Jeep Cherokee SUV onto railroad tracksin Glendale shortly before 6 a.m. and then ran fromthe vehicle as a Metrolink commuter train bore down inthe early-morning darkness.The impact caused a chain of collisions and derailments involving afreight locomotive and another Metrolink train traveling in the oppositedirection, killing 11 people and injuring nearly 200 others.The Los Angeles County district attorney, Steve Cooley, said Thursday thathe had deep doubts about comments by some law enforcementofficials that Alvarez was deranged or insane. He criticized thepolice statements and suggested that Alvarez may have calculated hisactions to send a message, perhaps to his estranged wife.""Nothing about the facts leads us to this conclusion to suggestinsanity, in spite of some people using those terms,"" Cooleysaid. ""They're using the terms in a very loose way.They're probably uninformed about all the details of this case.""Details will emerge soon, Cooley said, ""that will shed more lighton what was going on in his head, as towhat his intentions were.""Cooley said that a "" few things are under investigation thatdon't suggest"" Alvarez was acting in an insane manner andthat his acts might have had a design, which Cooleydeclined to describe in detail.On Wednesday, Glendale Police Chief Randy Adams called Alvarez suicidal and""deranged,"" saying that he had slashed his wrists and chest,then parked on the tracks. Adams said Alvarez apparently losthis nerve and fled his vehicle shortly before it wasrammed by the train. He was detained shortly afterward.Prosecutors filed 10 counts of murder against Alvarez on Thursday andthen said they would add an additional charge to accountfor an eleventh body discovered later in the wreckage. Thecharges allege special circumstances, which means that Alvarez would beeligible for the death penalty or life in prison withoutparole if convicted. It could be months before prosecutors decidewhat sentence to seek, Cooley said.Attorney Eric Chase, a criminal lawyer who has commented on high-profilecases such as the Scott Peterson murder trial for televisionshows and newspapers, said Thursday he would represent Alvarez. Hedeclined further comment other than to say his client wouldprobably appear in court today.Because of his medical condition, Alvarez was not able to attendan arraignment that had been scheduled for Thursday afternoon, authoritiessaid.Sgt. Tom Lorenz, a spokesman for the Glendale Police Department, saidthat it now appeared that Alvarez, who was in stablecondition in a hospital jail ward, had not slashed hiswrists, as originally reported by investigators. He has non-life-threatening stabwounds to his upper torso, Lorenz said, and it isnot certain the wounds were self-inflicted.""That is still under investigation,"" Lorenz said.As the questions emerged over what motivated Alvarez, new details weredisclosed about his troubled personal life.Alvarez' estranged wife, Carmelita Alvarez, obtained a restraining order against himin December after filing court papers saying her husband hada serious drug problem, was hallucinating and claiming falsely thatshe had lovers.She also alleged that he had threatened to abduct their 31/2-year-old son, Isaac. And she said he had threatened tokill her brother, Ruben Ochoa, who Alvarez claimed had introducedher to a lover.Her assertions were not contested by her husband, so his ownside the story was not provided in the 31 pagesof documents, and her descriptions of the problems were terse.Carmelita Alvarez, who said her husband was unemployed, alleged that atone point the talked of buying a gun. She describedherself as emotionally traumatized, although she said he had causedno physical injuries and that she had not called thepolice despite a string of traumatizing encounters.The wreck was the worst U.S. rail tragedy since March 15,1999 when an Amtrak train hit a truck and derailed,also killing 11.
Metrolink has sued the man whose aborted suicideattempt is blamed for last week's deadly train derailment, astrategy that experts said might be a way to fendoff lawsuits from victims and strengthen its legal position.The lawsuit, filed in Burbank Superior Court two days after thecollision, claimed negligence, carelessness and recklessness by Juan Manual Alvarezin parking his SUV on the train tracks and causing11 deaths and injuries to about 180.""It's a standard filing that we make whenever we have anincident where we've suffered damage to our property we believeas a result of another's actions,"" said Metrolink spokesman FranciscoOaxaca.Metrolink does not cite a monetary figure in the suit.Metrolink has not yet assessed the full extent of the damages,but each rail car costs between $3 million and $3.5million and each locomotive is about $4 million, Oaxaca said.Six cars and two locomotives involved in the wreck. Tracks cancost hundreds of thousands of dollars to repair, he said.Alvarez has been charged with murder with special circumstances -- makingthe death penalty a possibility -- in the crash deaths.Investigators said that a distraught Alvarez, intending to kill himself, parkedhis Jeep Grand Cherokee on the train tracks in Glendale.But when the train approached, he changed his mind andjumped out of the car.When southbound Train No. 100 smashed into the SUV, it derailed,rammed a parked Union Pacific freight train and collided withanother Metrolink train heading north out of Union Station.Legal experts said the filing could simply be part of theprocess to get more information on Alvarez or to discouragelawsuits from passengers or victims' families who live outside thestate.""This could be another way for Metrolink to be protecting itself,""said Jonathan Zasloff, law professor at the University of California,Los Angeles.'If they have already started a lawsuit concerning this accident inCalifornia, it is much less likely that one of thevictims of this accident can sue them in another court,either in another part of California or in another state.""The suit also could be a public relations move byMetrolink, which likely will be the target of numerous lawsuitsfrom the worst crash in its 12-year-history.""I think it's clearly strategic, because this guy can't pay alot of damages, so the stated reason of the suitis not the reason of the suit,"" said Gregory Keating,law professor at the University of Southern California.""I assume one dimension of it is public relations, because thepublic will get the message that Alvarez is to blamefor the accident.""Metrolink officials have said their policy has a $4 million deductibleand the agency has a reserve fund of $2 millionto $3 million to cover its deductibles.Metrolink has put up a stiff fight against lawsuits brought by19 injured passengers and the family of a Santa Claritawoman who died after a 2003 wreck in Burbank, accordingto the plaintiffs' attorney.In that case, a motorist drove around a barrier and acrossthe tracks as the train approached, causing the crash thatkilled one and rendered a Newhall attorney a paraplegic.Neither Glendale police nor Oaxaca were able to confirm if Alvarezhad car insurance, but even if he did, it isunlikely it would cover the damages Metrolink would be seeking.""I'm not aware of any auto policy that would come closeto meeting the threshold that would be involved in somethinglike this,"" said Pete Moraga, spokesman for Insurance Information Networkof California, which represents the property casualty insurance industry.Teresa Nance, daughter of victim Elizabeth Hill, 65, said Metrolink issimply trying to shift its liability onto Alvarez.""He doesn't have anything. This is just so he could beconsidered liable as opposed to Metrolink in case anybody broughtsuit against them,"" Nance said. She said she has notthought about filing suit against Metrolink. ""I don't see suinghim would do any good. There's nothing to gain there.I think they're just doing that to try to pawnthe responsibility off on what they did.""Oaxaca did not want to respond to Nance's comment, only saying,""I can understand her reaction. But this filing has nothingto do with anyone involved on those two trains.""
The laborer charged with triggering the deadly Metrolinkderailment was making a ""twisted"" attempt to win back hisestranged wife -- not trying to commit suicide -- whenhe abandoned his SUV on the tracks, police said Thursday.Juan Manuel Alvarez, 25, deliberately parked his Jeep Grand Cherokee onthe tracks and doused both the exterior and interior ofhis car with gasoline, planning to create a ""spectacular"" sceneto gain his wife's sympathy, Glendale police Lt. Jon Perkinssaid in an interview.""He had a number of choices to make. He could havetorched himself, laid on the tracks, put the car onthe tracks, but he didn't choose any of those. Webelieve that this was nothing more than an attention-getting modelto have his wife take him back.""I don't think he ever intended to kill himself.""During Alvarez's arraignment on Tuesday, prosecutors added arson charges to the11 counts of murder with special circumstances already filed againstthe Compton man. He pleaded not guilty.""It was a deliberate act with total disregard for anybody else,""Perkins said in providing new details of the Jan. 26crash that killed 11 people and injured nearly 200 others.""He only had a selfish motivation in mind. It washis twisted way of gaining sympathy from his wife.""Police would not say whether Alvarez called his wife before orafter crash. However, detectives said while he was in thehospital he continually asked if his wife was there.""He was concerned to know if his wife was at thehospital and if this incident brought her to see him,""said Detective Bob Breckenridge.Alvarez's attorney, Eric Chase, released a statement criticizing the police fortheir comments.""The statements of Glendale police today are not only vicious andcallous but are a reckless distortion of the facts,"" hesaid. ""If they want to make this case about, asthey say, 'Juan Alvarez's intent to cause a horrific tragedy,'I hope they can back it up.""The District Attorney's Office refused to comment.Witnesses told police they saw Alvarez park his SUV parallel tothe tracks, then pour a liquid -- investigators have sincedetected gasoline on the wreckage -- from a plastic containeron its hood and roof. Moments later, the SUV wasparked with its front wheels on the track and Alvarezon the passenger side with the door open.He was then seen ""engaged in some type of activity"" insidethe Cherokee until he saw the train coming, Perkins said.""When the train started approaching, he started running,"" Perkins said.Authorities have said that Alvarez was horrified when he saw thecrash and ran to a friend's house in nearby AtwaterVillage. He stabbed at his wrists and chest with scissors,which led to early speculation that the crash was theresult of an aborted suicide attempt.Two days after the crash, Metrolink filed suit against Alvarez, claiminghis actions caused the derailment of a southbound commuter train.It collided with a parked Union Pacific locomotive, then crashedinto a northbound Metrolink train.Rita Tutino, whose husband, Los Angeles sheriff's Deputy James Tutino, diedin the crash, filed a claim earlier this week, claimingMetrolink was negligent in its management and operation of thecommuter line.In a phone interview Thursday, Rita Tutino said that whatever hisintent, Alvarez knew that placing his car on the trackswould endanger the lives of hundreds of people.""Why didn't he just go buy her roses? Why didn't hewrite her a letter? Why didn't he go get help?You don't put at risk the lives of hundreds ofpeople,"" she said. ""I'm one of 11 families that losta family member.""It's utterly ridiculous whether he's trying to kill himself or tryingto get the attention of his wife.""Perkins said investigators are working with prosecutors to prove that Alvarez'sactions were not influenced by mental illness.
The authorities now believe that the man whoparked his truck on a rail line last month intendedto cause the deadly train wreck that resulted and wasnot suicidal, as they had initially surmised.The police in Glendale, the Los Angeles suburb where the wreckoccurred on Jan. 26, said this week that the man,Juan M. Alvarez believed he would get his estranged wife'sattention by causing a catastrophic accident.Eleven people died and 180 were injured after Alvarez, 25, abandonedhis Jeep Cherokee on railroad tracks during the morning rushhour. The vehicle was hit by a Metrolink commuter trainheaded for downtown Los Angeles. The train derailed and sideswipedanother train.The authorities said at the time that Alvarez, despondent over familialdiscord, had been planning to commit suicide, but that hehad lost his nerve and ran from his Jeep ashe saw the train approach.After investigating the case further, however, the Glendale police chief, RandyAdams, said that Alvarez fully intended to cause a majoraccident, and that taking his own life was not partof the plan.""Although first impressions led us to believe Mr. Alvarez was attemptingto commit suicide, the investigation has revealed that his actionsare not consistent with that of an individual who isattempting to follow through with that act,"" Adams said.""Although Mr. Alvarez may have contemplated suicide, his actions were deliberatewith the intent of causing a horrific tragedy,"" he said.Adams said Alvarez had poured gasoline on the Cherokee, apparently withthe intention of seeing it go up in a ballof fire.The lead detective on the case, Lt. Jon Perkins, told reportersthat Alvarez had been asked what he thought would occurwhen a train collided with a vehicle in that situation.""He basically stated that he thought there would be an explosion,""Perkins said.Investigators believe that Alvarez sought to gain notice from his wife,Carmelita, who had obtained a restraining order against him.Shortly after the accident, Alvarez described her husband as an insecureman who believed himself incapable of providing for his family.Alvarez's lawyer, Eric A. Chase, said in an interview Friday thatthe Glendale police were ""trying to poison the jury pool""by accusing Alvarez of deliberately causing the wreck.Chase, who insisted that his client was suicidal, also disputed thepolice chief's assertion that Alvarez poured gasoline on the Jeep.""He poured the gasoline on himself,"" Chase said. ""The police foundgasoline-soaked clothing at his home.""Chase said his client expected ""that the train would blow throughthe car,"" and had no idea that the train --which was being pushed by a locomotive engine, not pulled-- would leave the tracks.""How was he supposed to know that the train was inthis funky configuration?"" Chase asked.In a statement issued by his office, Chase said that thestatements by the Glendale police were ""not only vicious andcallous but are a reckless distortion of the facts.""Earlier this week, Alvarez, who is being held without bail, pleadednot guilty to 11 counts of murder. His next courtappearance will be at preliminary hearing on March 16, whena judge will consider if there is enough evidence tosend him to trial.
LOS ANGELES - A handyman accused of causing the Jan. 26Metrolink crash that killed 11 passengers and injured nearly 200others was ordered Thursday to stand trial on murder andarson charges.Wrapping up a three-day preliminary hearing, Los Angeles Superior Court JudgeWilliam R. Pounders determined there is enough evidence to tryJuan Manual Alvarez, 26, of Compton on charges stemming fromthe deadliest U.S. train crash since 1999.He is scheduled to be arraigned on May 19 on 11counts of murder, including the special-circumstance allegations of multiple murder,train wrecking and arson. Prosecutors have not yet decided whetherto seek the death penalty.Witnesses testified that Alvarez doused his Jeep Cherokee with gasoline, thenabandoned it on the railroad tracks near Glendale, where ittriggered a chain-reaction crash involving two Metrolink trains and arail car.""The defendant placed a 4,000-pound Molotov cocktail on the train tracks,""prosecutor Alan Jackson said. ""And he used Passenger Train 100as the match to light the Molotov cocktail.""Alvarez's attorney, Eric Chase, maintains his client was despondent over thebreakup of his marriage and had planned to kill himself-- but not anyone else -- when he parked onthe tracks.""The gasoline simply assured that death would be quicker and morepainless,"" said Chase, who claimed that his client tried todrive his Jeep off the tracks but got stuck.But prosecutors say he set out to cause a major catastrophein order to garner attention and win back the sympathyof his estranged wife.X X X
",The crash renewed concerns of engineers and safety experts that it is unsafe for locomotives to push rather than pull cars. The LA County DA expressed serious doubts about law enforcers' comments that Alvarez was deranged or insane and suggested he may have been trying to send a message to his estranged wife when he left his SUV on the tracks. Alvarez remained heavily sedated and under suicide watch. Prosecutors said he caused the crash to get his wife's attention and sympathy. Alvarez pled not guilty to murder and arson charges and prosecutors sought the death penalty against him. ,"Prosecutors added arson to the 11 counts of murder with special circumstances against Alvarez after it was determined that he had poured gasoline on his vehicle. The district attorney has contradicted the police and has suggested that his act was calculated and not a suicidal or insane act. A Glendale policeman said that Alvarez planned to create a ""spectacular"" scene to gain his wife's sympathy. Alvarez has pleaded not guilty to all counts and is being held without bail. His lawyer maintains he was despondent over his marriage break-up and planned to kill himself but not others. ","Witnesses saw Alvarez douse his SUV with gasoline, position it across the tracks and walk away. Train 100's lead car pushed the SUV down the track, derailed, turned on its side and slid into a freight car, toppling it. As Train 901 passed, the jackknifed Train 100 cars derailed 901's rear two cars. Alvarez was trying to create a spectacle to win back his estranged wife, not commit suicide. He slashed his arms and chest superficially with scissors. Alvarez pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of murder and arson with special circumstances (train wrecking). Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. ",It appeared that Alvarez had not slashed his wrists and that his other wounds were not life-threatening. He was charged with murder. Arson was added to the murder charges because forensic tests had revealed the presence of gasoline in and on the SUV and witnesses said that they had seen him douse the car before abandoning it. Alvarez might have intended to create a spectacular scene to get his wife's sympathy. In May he pleaded not guilty to murder and arson charges. Prosecutors will seek the death penalty. 
D0940,D0940-A,"Disney officials consulted Chinese feng shui experts before building Hong KongDisneyland, making changes such as tilting the site of the park several degreesand setting up ""no fire zones"" in kitchens, a company spokeswoman saidSunday.Feng shui is the Chinese belief that harmonious energy and therefore betterfortune can be achieved by the correct positioning of furniture and otherobjects.Other feng shui influences include the park's orientation to face water withmountains behind, Hong Kong Disneyland spokeswoman Esther Wongsaid.The park's groundbreaking date and opening date of Sept. 12 were picked afterconferring with feng shui specialists, she said.Feng shui experts also designated ""no fire zones"" in the kitchens, to try tokeep the five elements of metal, water, wood, fire and earth inbalance.Wong said U.S.-based Walt Disney Co. decided to observe feng shui because itwanted to defer to local custom.""It's cultural considerations,"" Wong said, noting, ""all the food and language inthe park must follow the habits and tastes of our consumers and futureguests.""Hong Kongers tend to be Westernized, but Hong Kong Disneyland is expected todraw droves of guests from neighboring mainland China.However, Disney's cultural sensitivity drew a backlash recently. The park hadplanned to serve shark's fin soup, a Chinese delicacy, but dropped the dishafter protests from environmentalists who expressed fears about the extinctionof sharks.Hong Kong Disneyland _ built on reclaimed land in the outlying Lantau island _is a joint venture between The Walt Disney Co. and the Hong Kong government, butlocal taxpayers are footing most of the construction bill.Critics have questioned whether the government got a good deal. Officials havesaid the park will boost employment and tourism.
Hong Kong is banking on Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Buzz Lightyear to turn thecity of skyscrapers and designer boutiques into one of the best places in Asiafor a family holiday.But critics say Hong Kong Disneyland, which opens Sept. 12, won't be the magickingdom its supporters say it will be. They question whether the park is thebest way to create jobs, and they're also doubtful that it will attractbig-spending tourists.A fantasy land with a Sleeping Beauty Castle set against lush mountains on anoutlying island, Hong Kong Disneyland predicts it will draw about 3.6 milliontourists to Hong Kong within a year and up to 7.4 million annually after 15years.The park is expected to create 18,400 jobs _ 5,000 on site and the restindirectly _ a number predicted to grow to 35,800 over two decades, according tothe park and its prime investor, the Hong Kong government.Authorities have bold ambitions: They hope Mickey Mouse will bring in a total of148 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$19 billion; euro15 billion) over 40 years andtransform the center for shopping and gourmet food into a tourist destinationfor all ages.These potential benefits came at a hefty price for the government, which has a57 percent stake in the park.Hong Kong taxpayers are shelling out HK$16.5 billion (US$2.1 billion; euro1.7billion), including costs for reclaiming land and supporting infrastructure, andextending a HK$6.1 billion (US$782 million; euro631 million)loan.Disney's tab comes in much smaller. It's paying HK$2.45 billion (US$314 million;euro253 million) and HK$120 million (US$15.4 million; euro12.4 million) in rentper year.But even Hong Kong's political opposition, frequently at odds with thegovernment, thinks it's the right move.Democratic Party lawmaker Sin Chung-kai, the opposition's point man on theproject, said the park will boost Hong Kong's economy.""Looking at jobs creation ... tourism, we approved the project from thisperspective,"" Sin said.But critics say Hong Kong Disneyland is overrated.Without the theme park, the territory's economy would still be able to generatejust as many jobs _ and without the hefty investment from taxpayers, arguesCredit Suisse First Boston economist Tao Dong.""It has more news value than economic value,"" he said.Tao questioned whether Hong Kong offered enough flights and hotel rooms tohandle the expected influx of Disneyland visitors. The Hong Kong HotelsAssociation has said the territory aims to add 14,000 extra hotel rooms by theend of the year.Disneyland officials have said they expect about 40 percent of the visitors willeventually come from mainland China, just a short ride away by bus or train.China relaxed rules on travel to Hong Kong in 2003, allowing its citizens to goas individuals instead of part of a tour group.Tony Latter, a senior research fellow at the Hong Kong Institute of Economicsand Business Strategy, expressed worries that low-spending tourists _ anapparent reference to visitors from China, where wages are low _ may create moreproblems than benefits.""High spenders are fine. But the low spenders probably incur more hidden costsin terms of inconvenience, and pressure on infrastructure, than they generateadded value for the economy,"" Latter said in a recent op-ed piece in the SouthChina Morning Post.Chinese traveling to Hong Kong on their own instead of with a tour group spentan average of HK$7,429 (US$952; euro768) in 2005, down from HK$10,440 in 2004,according to a study by Market Insights Group, which also found that more than10 percent of the visitors in 2005 were just window-shoppers.They spent an average of about four days in the city in 2005, compared to abouta week in 2004, the survey said.The government should enrich the tourist experience beyond shopping bydeveloping more tourist sites and activities unique to Hong Kong, not justDisneyland, Market Insights Group Director Roland Leung said.""In terms of developing tourism facilities, we are focusing too much on one newsite _ Disneyland,"" he said.""We worry that even though people will spend an extra few hundred (Hong Kong)dollars (US$20-30) on tickets and some extra money on food, drinks and souvenirsbecause of Disneyland, overall it may not necessarily have a significanteconomic effect,"" he said.
Mickey Mouse, Sleeping Beauty's castle and the Lion King are all here atDisney's new theme park in Hong Kong, along with classic rides familiar to fansof other Disney theme parks _ Space Mountain, the Mad Hatter Tea Cups andDumbo.But in creating the Disney experience for a mostly Chinese audience, thisthoroughly American _ and notoriously detail-obsessed _ company has incorporatedmany elements of local culture.Experts in the Chinese tradition of feng shui _ the belief that harmoniousenergy and good fortune can be achieved by the correct positioning of furnitureand other objects _ were put on the payroll.And while Coke and hamburgers can easily be found, guests can also dine on dimsum and sweet and sour pork. Signage is in both Chinese and English.On the advice of feng shui masters, the park faces the water with mountains inthe back. The feng shui experts even picked the opening date of the park _ Sept.12.Park officials also tweaked the layout to conform with feng shui principles.They recommended ""no fire"" zones in restaurant kitchens _ with an eye to keepingthe five elements of metal, water, wood, fire and earth in balance _ and waterfountains. A giant fountain near the park entrance features Mickey Mouse surfingon a stream of water spouting from a whale. Statues of Donald Duck and MinnieMouse stand nearby.Visitors can navigate the park with signs written in their native Chinese, butthe rides also include bilingual explanations. Inside the Buzz Lightyear AstroBlasters ride, a talking animated Buzz Lightyear figure speaks in English whileChinese subtitles are flashed on a display board nearby.Disney has delved deepest into local culture with the menu, which encompassesseveral Asian cuisines. Apart from Chinese staples, there's also Kashmirichicken curry and shrimp and vegetable tempura.The Asian culinary delights are served in restaurants with decidedly un-Chinesearchitecture, providing a sometimes bizarre East-meets-West contrast.The Tahitian Terrace restaurant serves roasted duck and curry laksa noodle soup.The Viennese-influenced Market House Bakery in Main Street, U.S.A, uses Europeandecor but juxtaposes Western pastries with Hong Kong-style delicacies. Chocolatecroissants and cinnamon rolls are displayed alongside barbecued pork puffs, eggtarts and pineapple buns.The rest of the park _ and even supporting infrastructure _ is vintage Disney.Hong Kong's subway operator has launched a Mickey-themed train carriage _ withwindows and hanging straps shaped like the character's head _ to ferry visitorsfrom a suburban rail line to the park and back.Hong Kong Disneyland also includes a variety of Disney attractions foundelsewhere. In addition to Space Mountain, Mad Hatter Tea Cups, Dumbo the FlyingElephant, and Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters, there is a Jungle River Cruise andthe ""Festival of the Lion King"" show, inspired by the animatedmovie.Anchoring the park's skyline is a replica of the original Sleeping Beauty Castlefrom Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif., the flagship park that opened 50 yearsago.And ""The Golden Mickeys,"" a Broadway-style show that until now has been seenonly on Disney cruises, has come ashore with its debut in HongKong.One standout in Hong Kong is Mickey's PhilharMagic in Fantasyland, a 3-D showwith appearances from Mickey, Donald Duck, Ariel from ""The Little Mermaid,""Aladdin, Peter Pan, Tinker Bell and Simba.With the help of 3-D glasses, the Disney characters appear as if they're rightin front of the viewer. When Donald Duck is splashed with water, the audience islikewise sprinkled. The scent of cherries fills the theater when a dessert dishshows up on screen.Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy certainly aren't alien to the children ofWesternized Hong Kong, but the average person in mainland China, a major targetmarket for Hong Kong Disneyland, is less Disney-savvy.So Disney has launched a massive marketing campaign. It tapped clean-cut HongKong pop star Jacky Cheung _ a singer and actor who is one of the biggest actsin the Chinese-speaking world _ as park spokesman.Since July 2004, Chan has hosted a TV program aired in both Hong Kong and Chinathat shows classic Disney movies.Disney has also introduced a fashion line at bargain clothing retailer Giordano,which has 1,500 outlets in Asia, Australia and the Middle East, 644 of which arein mainland China. The clothing features pictures of Disney characters rangingfrom Mickey to Nemo.A heavy dosage of all things Disney aside, Hong Kong Disneyland offers a rareexpanse of space and lush greenery in a densely populated territory better knownfor its towering skyscrapers than wildlife.The park is a landscaping achievement, reproducing a slice of America with Asianaccents.The driveway leading to the park entrance is lined with tall palm trees, andAdventureland mixes palm trees with bamboo fences, torches, rock formations,straw-thatched roofs and a fake jungle river in what resembles the set of the TVshow ""Survivor.""Long open-air shelters that make up the bus depot are decorated by old-stylelamps and rotating fan blades hanging from the ceiling, creating the feel of asaloon in the old American West.At 126 hectares (310 acres), Hong Kong Disneyland is the smallest Disney park inthe world, but Disney says expansions are planned. One addition already lined upis the Autopia car ride in Tomorrowland.Pricing at the park is affordable by Hong Kong standards but on the higher endfor visitors from China. Even in the commercial hub of Shanghai, which enjoys amuch higher standard of living than most Chinese cities, the minimum monthlywage is a paltry 690 Chinese yuan (US$85;euro70).At the Emporium souvenir shop, a Mickey Mouse key chain costs 60 Hong Kongdollars (US$7.70;euro6.4); a standard Hong Kong Disneyland cap is priced HK$100(US$13;euro11).Admission is HK$350 (US$45;euro37) for the weekend and public holidays, HK$295(US$38;euro31) on weekdays _ the cheapest among Disney's five parks around theworld. Children under 11 pay HK$250 (US$32;euro27) on weekends and HK$210(US$27;euro22) during the week.The park houses two hotels _ Victorian-style Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel, withlots of towers and fussy architecture, and the sleek-looking Disney's HollywoodHotel.These accommodations are steeply priced: Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel starts atHK$1,600 (US$205;euro170) a night and Disney's Hollywood Hotel's cheapest roomcosts HK$1,000 (US$128;euro106).For budget travelers, staying in the city is recommended. Hong Kong offershotels in many different price ranges, and the park is only about a 20-plusminute subway train ride from downtown Hong Kong.___If You Go...@
Hong Kong Disneyland said Thursday it won't cut its daily maximum capacity of30,000 people despite complaints of large crowds and long queues from visitorsduring rehearsal days.Many of the 29,000 visitors who visited Hong Kong Disneyland for a charity daylast weekend complained of excessively long queues to enter the park as well asto get on rides, and critics have urged Disney to reduce its maximum dailycapacity, local newspapers reported.But a Disney spokeswoman, Esther Wong, said the company is ""confident we canmanage peak day attendance in the future and have designed our marketing andsales plan to manage attendance at Hong Kong Disneyland throughout theyear.""Earlier, Disney said it was considering extending opening hours and adding moreshows at the park _ due to open Monday _ as Hong Kong's financial chiefexpressed concern about the large crowds when the park is operating at itscapacity.The park, a joint venture between the Hong Kong government and The Walt DisneyCo., is expected to draw 5.6 million people in its first year of operation, withmainland Chinese tourists accounting for about a third of thatnumber.But mainland travel agents said ticket sales for Hong Kong Disneyland are pooras the long queues and expensive hotel rates are driving mainland tourists away,the South China Morning Post reported Thursday.""We only managed to sell roughly 300 tickets during the first week after thepark opens,"" Huang Feiyueh, executive director of Amsito Travel Service, wasquoted as saying.A survey released Wednesday by Hong Kong's top pro-China political party, theDemocratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, also showedthat about three out of 10 people who had visited Hong Kong Disneyland said theywon't go back.Wong, however, disputed the criticisms and said ""we are confident that our parkwill be very popular.""
Many in Hong Kong are ready to give Mickey Mouse a big hug for bringingDisneyland to them. But not dog-lovers, shark-defenders and fireworksfoes.The opposition may seem odd, in a Chinese city where fireworks are a fixture,shark fin soup is hugely popular, and stray dogs are summarily dealt with ashealth hazards.But eight years after the British colony was returned to China, the capitalistcity is much freer than the Communist mainland, and advocacy groups arevocal.To start with the sharks: Disneyland said it was merely trying to honor localcustom by selling shark fin soup at weddings in the park that opens Monday. Butenvironmentalists protested that shark populations are being depleted by thefishing industry, which usually hacks off the fins before tossing the fish backinto the sea to die.A top-level decision was made to take the soup off the menu, said Robert Iger,president of the Walt Disney Co.Disney made more headlines when it asked dog-catchers to round up dozens ofstray mutts near the park, sending many of them to a certaindeath.And then there were the plans for nightly fireworks displays at the park onLantau, Hong Kong's largest island. Neighbors said they were worried about thenoise and smoke, but the park stuck with its original plans.In the months before the park's opening, the media sometimes sounded as thoughDisney were building a shoddy nuclear plant, rather than a cheerful amusementpark with cuddly cartoon characters and a pink Sleeping Beauty Castle with amountain backdrop.Hong Kong Disneyland became a target because it involved high-profile marriageof big business and Hong Kong's government, the biggest investor in the US$3billion park, said David Ketchum, a public relations expert.""As the Australians say, 'The tall poppy gets the chop,' and Disney's highprofile worldwide and the lead-up to the opening has meant that many are lookingfor ways the venture will fail,"" Ketchum said.Michael DeGolyer, professor of government and international studies at Hong KongBaptist University, said Disneyland apparently underestimated environmentalcares in the crowded territory of about 7 million people.""If they thought that a huge commitment of government money would cushion themfrom public criticism, I think they will, and seem already, to be discoveringthat is not, definitely not, the case,"" DeGolyer said.But Disneyland's Iger said construction went smoothly with no major harm to theenvironment or public.""None of the issues really rose to the level of what I call a major concern inour minds, because they were either exaggerated _ and I won't be specific _ orthey were fixable,"" Iger told The Associated Press.Hong Kong's leader, Donald Tsang, dismissed the complaints about the fireworks,saying Disneyland is complying with regulations. ""They have passed the test andI am satisfied with those tests,"" the chief executive told reporters.Tsang's administration says the park will create thousands of new jobs and helpturn Hong Kong into a regional tourist destination for families.Christine Loh, a former lawmaker who runs her own think tank, Civic Exchange,said, ""Hong Kong people as a whole don't hate Disney. They don't think it's themost awful thing to have a Disney theme park in Hong Kong _ unlike other partsof the world where citizens got together and said they don't want this kind oftrash.""But Loh said there's unease and suspicion over the government being the park'sprime investor as well as its regulator, and over the size of itsstake.""The initial reaction was quite positive,"" she said. ""But as it rolled out, HongKong people felt, is this a reasonable deal for us, or are we giving away prettymuch everything to have them?""
Commissioner for Tourism Eva Cheng Wednesday said the opening of Hong Kong Disneyland will be divided into three phases from early August in order to ensure a smooth and well-coordinated start.""The idea of a phased opening is to give the theme park, publictransport operators and relevant departments a familiarization period to adjust their operation and services,"" Cheng said.From early August to mid-August, the Disneyland Resort Line is scheduled to run between Sunny Bay and Disneyland Resort Stations.A section of the Park Promenade linked to the line will be opened.From August to Sept. 11, all public facilities at Penny's Bay, including public roads, the Park Promenade, the Inspiration Lake Recreation Center, the Disneyland Resort Public Transport Interchange, the Disneyland car and coach parks and the DisneylandResort Pier will begin operation. Franchised buses and taxis will also start service.From Sept. 12, the theme park and hotels will be open to the public.To ensure both the public and visitors are well informed of theoperation sequence, communication channels have been set up by relevant departments and operators.Visitors can obtain information for planning their trips by visiting a designated website, the Transport Department's website,and the Hong Kong Disneyland website.Inquiry telephone lines will also be provided by the departmentand Hong Kong Disneyland. Information booklets, TV and radio commercials will be launched in August.Cheng said the familiarization period will last for more than one month. She urged people to plan their visit, and make good useof communication channels to gather important information, such asthe new transport services and opening hours.
Hong Kong Disneyland started its on-line tickets selling Friday and its spokesperson said the process had been smooth so far.Hong Kong Disneyland announced its on-line ticketing plan on June 22. People who want to visit the theme park need to use theircredit card to book tickets through the website of Hong Kong Disneyland. Each credit card can buy at most 10 tickets.The theme park said that starting from Friday, guests can buy tickets for its grand opening day on Sept. 12 and the first 90 days after its opening.Hong Kong Disneyland will begin its rehearsal on Aug. 16 and itwill last for approximately four weeks.Rehearsal days have been a long-standing tradition at Disney theme parks and present an opportunity for cast members -- Disneyland's term for employees -- to practice and adjust their performance.Specially invited guests include business affiliates, travel trade associates, contractors, consultants, alliance partners, government officers who have been involved in the disneyland project, and certain charitable organizations.Among the first guests to be received during the rehearsal dayswill be Hong Kong Disneyland cast members and their families.Invitations to guests will range from several thousand to 30,000 on a daily basis.
Hong Kong Disneyland will stage its rehearsal from Aug. 16 to the theme park's opening on Sept. 12,the park said in a press release on Friday.Rehearsal days have been a long-standing tradition at Disney theme parks and resorts around the world and present an opportunity for cast members, Disney's term for employees, to practice and adjust their performance.The rehearsal period at HK Disneyland will last for approximately four weeks prior to the grand opening.Specially invited guests including business affiliates, travel trade associates, contractors, consultants, alliance partners, government officers who have been involved in the Hong Kong Disneyland project, and certain charitable organizations can enjoya full day of Disney magic.Among the first guests to be received during rehearsal days will be Hong Kong Disneyland cast members and their families on August 16.Invitations to guests to experience the park will range from thousands to 30,000 on a daily basis.Meanwhile, tickets for Hong Kong Disneyland's grand opening dayand the first 90 days after its opening went on sale Friday.
The ticket sale of the Hong KongDisneyland has been proceeding well, although there are still tickets left for all the days available for booking online, Hong Kong Disneyland Group Managing Director Don Robinson said Monday.""We started ticket sales last week, they are very popular. The opening day and the weekend is most popular."" Robinson said after a signing ceremony with Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited.Although the tickets for all the days are not sold out, Robinson said he is satisfied with the sale so far. He said the company is looking into other sale outlets.The Disneyland and Standard Chartered have signed an agreement Monday for Standard Chartered to take a leading role in providing various banking services for Hong Kong Disneyland, including the exclusive provision of ATMs throughout the park.
All of the 16,000 tickets for the opening day of Hong Kong Disneyland have been sold out and thepark will open to the public from 1:00 p.m. (0300 GMT) on Sept. 12, said Eva Cheng, Hong Kong commissioner for Tourism here Thursday.Speaking at a press conference for arrangements of Hong Kong Disneyland's opening, she said the Transport Department, Immigration Department, Police and some other government departments have made full preparations for the smooth opening of Hong Kong Disneyland.The opening of Hong Kong Disneyland is expected to turn on a new page of Hong Kong tourism, with focus on family tourists, she said.Simon Peh, assistant director of Immigration Department, said as one thirds of the Hong Kong Disneyland visitors are expected tocome from the Chinese mainland, the Immigration Department is ready to dispatch more staff members to various cross-border checkpoints during the opening day and other holidays.He suggested Chinese mainland passengers arrive in Hong Kong via Lo Wu Check Point, Hong Kong's largest cross boundary check point with 233 clearance counters.Apart from the six franchised bus routes that operate to and from Hong Kong Disneyland as of Aug. 16, 60 additional quotas for cross-boundary coach services to and from Hong Kong Disneyland viaLok Ma Chau Control Point will become operational from Sept. 12.In addition, the Kwoloon-Canton Railway Corporation will also operate a ""rail-bus"" service for mainland visitors to travel between the Lo Wu Check Point and Hong Kong Disneyland via Sheung Shui Station from Sept. 12.Cheng said, a sample survey made among 3,000 Guangdong citizensin August showed that over half of the people, who are ready to visit Hong Kong in September and October, plan to visit Hong Kong Disneyland.To receive more tourists, the total number of hotel rooms will be increased from 40,000 at the end of last year to about 54,000 at the end of 2006, she added.
","Hong Kong Disneyland (HKD) was scheduled to open in three phases in the summer of 2005. Early to mid-August transportation would be available to some areas of the park. August-Sept 11 all public services would become available. Sept 12 the grand opening of the park and hotels would take place. On Aug 16 HKD will begin its rehearsals to which special guests will be invited. In September, HKD announced it would not cut its daily capacity of 30,000 visitors. On Sept 9 it was revealed that all tickets for the grand opening had been sold. ","The Hong Kong Disneyland was built by Walt Disney Company and the HKSA government in 2005 in three phases to ensure a smooth start. Disney consulted Chinese feng shui before building Disneyland and its influences were incorporated into the park's physical orientation, opening date, and local cultural considerations. Disneyland staged its rehearsal period for four weeks before opening for employee performance practice. While ticket sales were initially good, they were disappointing. The HKSAR government funded the bulk of the park and was positive about it initially. After a while they questioned whether it was a reasonable deal for them. ","Disney consulted feng shui experts before building Hong Kong Disneyland. Changes included tilting the site, orienting it to face water with mountains behind, and creating water fountains and 'no fire zones' in kitchens. Disney directed a massive marketing campaign at mainland China. A three-phased opening rehearsal would begin in early August and last about a month, to allow for familiarization and adjustment. Disney declined to cut maximum capacity of 30,000 despite complaints of crowds and long lines but removed shark fin soup from its menu after environmentalist complaints. Expensive hotel rates dampened mainland ticket sales. More hotel rooms were planned. ","Hong Kong Disneyland, a joint venture between Disney and the Hong Kong government, was scheduled to open on 12 September. Rehearsal days were staged for a month before opening, giving ""cast members"" a chance to practice their performances. Disneyland refused to reduce its daily maximum capacity of 30,000 despite complaints from early visitors about large crowds and long lines. All 16,000 opening day tickets were sold out. The park is vintage Disney, with aspects of local culture including feng shui, Asian foods, and signs in Chinese. Protests forced them to remove shark fin soup from their menus. "
D0940,D0940-B,"Hong Kong's Disney theme park has drawn much lower than expected visitors in the two months since opening, a press report said Monday.A headcount of visitors to the park carried out by four reporters of the South China Morning Post showed that 12,972 people visited on Sunday November 13, and 11,399 entered on Wednesday November 16.The government, which owns a 57 percent stake in the three billion US dollar resort, said it expected 5.6 million visitors in its first year of operation, equivalent to an average daily attendance of 15,342.The park failed to attract the crowds despite introducing a discounted price for Hong Kong residents from November 8 to December 8, the report said. Disney and the government have so far refused to reveal the park's daily attendance figures.Rail operator MTR Corp has said the Disneyland Resort line carries 10,000 people on weekdays and 20,000 on Sundays.A Disneyland spokeswoman dismissed the headcount, saying: ""Any attempt to count our attendance is flawed"" while a Tourism Commission spokeswoman declined to reveal the figures for commercial reasons.
Hong Kong Disneyland Tuesday dismissed a report that the two-month-old theme park is suffering from poor attendence and has failed to attract the number of visitors expected by the local government.""We are actually very happy with the attendence over the last couple of weeks so we are not at all concerned,"" said Roy Tan Hardy, vice president of marketing and sales for Hong Kong Disneyland.  He declined to reveal the actual attendence figures.""We can tell you it's been very very strong ... we are very happy with the way things are going,"" he told local radio.The South China Morning Post reported Monday that the theme park has drawn fewer-than-expected visitors since its opening on September 12 and a week after it introduced a discounted price for local residents.A headcount of visitors to the park carried out by four reporters showed that 12,972 people visited on Sunday November 13 and 11,399 on Wednesday November 16.The government, which owns a 57 percent stake in the three billion US dollar resort, has said it expected 5.6 million visitors in its first year of operation, equivalent to an average daily attendance of 15,342.The government also refused to reveal the park's daily attendance figures although rail operator MTR Corp has said the Disneyland Resort line carries 10,000 people on weekdays and 20,000 on Sundays.
Hong Kong Disneyland threw open its gates to the public on Monday, markingMickey Mouse's biggest push into China _ a market the U.S. company hopes willflood the theme park with splurging tourists from the world's most populousnation.With the pink Snow White Castle behind them, Disney executives and a seniorChinese leader celebrated the opening with musicians clanging cymbals, Chineselion dancers prancing precariously on tall poles and fireworks bursting in thesky.The ceremony ended with a parade of skipping Disney characters old and new:Mickey, Donald Duck, Mushu the dragon, Lilo and Winnie the Pooh.Robert Iger, president of the Walt Disney Co., said it was exciting being partof China's future. ""As millions discover the wonders of Hong Kong and China _one of the most rapidly growing travel destinations in the world _ the future isindeed bright,"" he said.Chinese Vice President Zeng Qinghong called the park ""Hong Kongers' eternalcarnival.""Hundreds of visitors lined up outside the park's gate, waiting to get in despitemuggy, sweltering heat.Michael Kuzma, of Celebration, Florida, began queuing up a day early and wasfirst in line. ""For over 50 years, the American people have experienced thehappiness of Disney theme parks. I hope the people of China can enjoy thehappiness,"" the 36-year-old consultant said.The attraction and its two resort hotels are surrounded by mountains on lushLantau Island, just 30 minutes away by subway from bustling central Hong Kong.It looks much like the first Disneyland in California, with a Space Mountainthrill ride, a classic Cinderella Carousel and Sleeping Beauty Castle _ whichDisney predicts will be one of the most photographed buildings inAsia.Hong Kong's government _ the biggest investor in the US$3.5 billion park _ saysthe attraction will help turn this global financial capital into Asia's bestfamily holiday spot.Disney hopes the park _ the 11th in its global empire _ will be a magnet forincreasingly wealthy Chinese tourists, who have a reputation for beingbig-spenders.Iger, president of Walt Disney Co., has said the Hong Kong park is a ""first bigstep"" in expanding the company's reach into China, where generations have grownup with little or no familiarity with Mickey Mouse.Iger said the park would create a media buzz and word-of-mouth excitement thatwould ignite interest in Disney films, TV shows and other products. HongKong-based Phoenix Television broadcast the Disneyland opening live to viewersacross China.Michael Eisner, Disney's chief executive officer, said China and Disneyland willbe a perfect match because they both value families.""You go to the park and you see mothers, daughters and kids and grandparents.The family unit in China is unbelievably strong. It's not just Hong Kong, it'smainland China,"" Eisner said.An hour before Monday's opening ceremony, a small crowd of labor, human rightsand anti-Disney activists gathered outside the park's front gate, chanting ""NoConscience"" and ""Evil Mickey."" They were protesting alleged labor abuses atfactories making Disney products in China. Disney has said it's investigatingthe claims.Hong Kong and Disney struck a deal to build the park in 1999 _ just two yearsafter the former British colony returned to Chinese rule. The city had beenbattered by the Asian financial crisis, and desperately needed a new project toboost its spirits and troubled economy.Disneyland says it employs 5,000 people and will draw 5.6 million visitors inits first year.So far, the biggest complaint among some of the thousands who got a sneak peakat the park during a soft opening period has been that Hong Kong Disneyland istoo small. It's Disney's smallest park at 40 hectares (about 100acres).The entire attraction _ including the two hotels _ is 121 hectares (298 acres) _and there's room to expand to 200 hectares (494 acres).Chinese tourist Zhang Wei predicted the park would be a big hit with themainland Chinese.""Disney has a big name and it will definitely attract people and be a success,""said the 38-year-old businessman from Beijing as he finished watching the dailyparade of floats carrying a waving Little Mermaid, Alice in Wonderland and BuzzLightyear.Hong Kongers have a reputation for being brusque and unsmiling, but theDisneyland staff _ including cleaners and guards _ have been trying to masterthe Disney tradition of giving guests a warm smile and hello.The greetings were Hong Kong visitor Evie Chan's favorite thing about the park.""The staff here is very friendly,"" said Chan, an employee of a marketing firm inher late 20s. ""It's like we've known each other for a long time.""
The newly opened Hong Kong Disneyland said Friday it prefers that its 5,000workers not unionize as activists described tough work conditions at the parksuch as long hours, harsh turnarounds and lack of breaks.Disneyland, which opened two weeks ago, said in a statement it respects theright of workers to seek union representation, but that it thinks it's moreeffective for labor and management to ""work and communicate directly with eachother.""The statement came as activists detailed strenuous work conditions at the parkand an organizer said it's exploring the option of setting up a union with parkworkers.Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions Organizing Secretary Elaine Hui said thepark was unresponsive to workers and that they need the leverage of a union toprotect themselves.""In the long run, if they want to discuss their treatment with the company, theyneed to rely on the power of a union to get the right to dialogue under equalcircumstances,"" she said, noting Disneylands in the U.S. and France haveunions.However, Hui said a stumbling block to unionizing is concern that the park mayretaliate against workers who join the union.As the union dilemma is debated, activists said Disneyland workers complain theywork up to 13 hours a day and must make quick turnarounds, with some leavingwork late in the evening and due back early in the morning the nextday.The long hours are aggravated by the long travel time to and from the park,which is located on Hong Kong's outlying Lantau island, the Hong KongConfederation of Trade Unions and Disney Hunter, a Disneyland watchdog group,said in a statement issued Thursday.The activists urged Disneyland, which opened Sept. 12, to arrange bus servicesfor workers covering more areas.They also said the workers' 45-minute lunch break should be lengthened to anhour and that 15-minute breaks every four hours aren't enforced because of staffshortages.""Disney's goal is to pursue dreams and bring happiness to the masses, but itslabor policy is entirely opposite to such a goal, disappointing its eagerworkers and the masses,"" the activists said in their statement.Hong Kong Disneyland spokeswoman Esther Wong said Friday the park won't commenton the allegations in detail, but that some of them are inaccurate.Wong said labor-management relations are good and that staff retention has beenstrong.But she said the park will listen to worker feedback.""Our cast members are a very important component,"" she said, using Disney'sterminology for its workers.
Hong Kong leader Donald Tsang Saturday defended the newly opened Disneylandagainst complaints of harsh labor conditions, saying Disney needs time to learnthe local culture.Hong Kong Disneyland employees have complained of long hours, quick turnaroundsand a lack of breaks.""We have to remember that Disneyland is a new organization (in Hong Kong). Itmay need time to understand the situation of Hong Kong and especially theculture of Hong Kongers and figure out how to make all its employees happy,""Tsang said at a question-and-answer session with local students.Tsang expressed surprise that an experienced company like Disney would run intoproblems in Hong Kong.But he said Disneyland, in which the Hong Kong government has a 57 percentstake, has gotten off to a ""very successful start."" The park has not announcedattendance figures.Hong Kong Disneyland is a joint venture between The Walt Disney Co. and thelocal government, but Hong Kong taxpayers shouldered most of the constructioncost.Critics have accused the government of bending over backward to accommodateDisney.
Hong Kong Disneyland said Tuesday it will offer ticket discounts for one monthto local residents to thank them for their support, but denied the move wasprompted by low attendance at the park, which opened two monthsago.""The discount has absolutely no relation to attendance numbers,"" parkspokeswoman Esther Wong said. ""We are thanking locals for giving us good supportsince we opened.""Starting Tuesday, prices for Hong Kong residents will be slashed by HK$50(US$6.40; euro5.5) per ticket _ a reduction of about 20 percent. A peak timeticket for an adult will cost HK$300 (US$38.60; euro33), instead of HK$350(US$45; euro38.50).The discount, given to those with a Hong Kong ID card, will last until Dec.8.Although Hong Kong Disneyland said the discount was unrelated to attendance, thepark has repeatedly refused to disclose how many people have been visiting. Manylocal media reports have said that attendance has been disappointing.On Tuesday, Wong said the park has no plans to disclose attendance numbersbecause they are confidential commercial information.This has angered some lawmakers who argue that the public should be privy to theinformation since the Hong Kong government is the biggest investor in thepark.The government paid US$2.4 billion for the park's construction, while Disneypaid over US$314 million, according to official figures.
Attendance at Hong Kong Disneyland is running below government forecasts twomonths after the park opened, the South China Morning Post reportedMonday.Disneyland officials have refused to say how many people have visited the park.This has angered lawmakers, who say the public has the right to know since thegovernment owns 57 percent of the attraction.The Post reported that it sent four reporters to Disneyland on Nov. 13 and 16 tocount visitors with handheld tally counters. The reporters counted 12,972visitors passing through the turnstiles on Nov. 13 and 11,399 on Nov. 16, thepaper said.The government has said it expected 5.6 million visitors _ an average of 15,342per day _ to the park in its first year of operation, the papersaid.The MTR Corp., which operates a special subway line to the park, said it usuallycarries 10,000 riders a day on weekdays and 20,000 on Sundays, the paper said.However, some of the riders only visit the promenade outside Disneyland anddon't go into the park, the paper said.A Disney spokeswoman said the newspaper's count was flawed but declined to givethe company's own figures, the report said. A Tourism Commission spokeswomansaid the Hong Kong government, which is the majority owner of the park, won'tdisclose attendance figures for commercial reasons, the papersaid.The government paid US$2.4 billion for the park's construction, while WaltDisney Co. paid over US$314 million, according to official figures.
Disney says ""well over"" 1 million people have visited Hong Kong Disneyland,finally relenting in releasing visitor figures amid speculation of disappointingattendance and criticism that the park _ mostly owned by the local government _wasn't transparent enough.""Hong Kong Disneyland has welcomed and entertained well over 1 million guests,""Walt Disney Parks and Resorts said in a statement issued lateWednesday.The statement came after park officials repeatedly refused to disclose visitornumbers because of their sensitive nature and media reports that attendance atthe park has been lackluster.The South China Morning Post reported Monday that its reporters counted severalthousand fewer park guests than the projected first-year daily average of 15,342on two days in November.In Wednesday's statement, Disney Parks and Resorts Chairman Jay Rasulo said suchcalculations are ""meaningless"" because they don't factor in seasonality.""The bottom-line is this: Attendance is ramping up well, which continues to giveus confidence that we are on track to achieve our long-term attendance goals,""Rasulo said.Disneyland's silence until now has frustrated critics who say the park must beheld accountable to the public because of the level of governmentinvestment.The government paid US$2.4 billion (euro2.03 billion) for the park'sconstruction, while Disney paid over US$314 million (euro 266 million),according to official figures.Disney also said mainland China, expected to be a major source of tourists forthe park, accounted for over a quarter, or 26 percent of guests. Foreignerscontributed 25 percent, and locals had a 49 percent share.
Hong Kong Disneyland, the 11th theme park of Walt Disney Co., officially opened here on Monday morning.Chinese Vice President Zeng Qinghong, Donald Tsang Yam-kuen, chief executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), and Tung Chee-hwa, vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee attended the opening.The Hong Kong Disneyland project, worth 3.5 billion US dollars,was jointly funded by Walt Disney Co. and the HKSAR government.Some 16,000 people attended the opening, and analysts predict the park will attract 5.6 million visitors in the opening year.
Hong Kong Disneyland said on Wednesday that over 80 percent of its guests have rated the overall experience at Hong Kong Disneyland as very good or excellent.Don Robinson, group managing director of Hong Kong Disneyland, said in a press release that it has achieved similar ratings for park cleanness, cast friendliness and entertainment.It said similarly ,over 80 percent of the guests of its two hotels have rated a positive satisfaction and more than half said they intend to make a return visit.However, it still declined to reveal the detailed number of guests it has received in the past month.Robinson said, over the past month, Hong Kong Disneyland received thousands of guests including the first marriage proposalon grand opening day and several large family reunions destinationthat unites people and crates a lifetime of happy memories.He said, based on guest feedback over the past month, Hong KongDisneyland has fine-tuned the park's operations to ensure the mostmagical experience possible for al guests.According to HK Disneyland, guests are choosing to purchase park tickets both on-line and the Hong Kong Disneyland Ticket Express Station at Hong Kong Station.The project of Hong Kong Disneyland was announced in 1999 and the construction began in 2003. It formally opened on Sept. 12.
","Hong Kong Disneyland (HKD) officially opened as planned on Sept. 12 with about 16,000 people attending including the Chinese vice president. Workers at HKD soon complained of long hours without break and quick turnarounds, raising the issue of unionization. HKD repeatedly refused a release of attendance figures. By November HKD offered discount tickets to residents of Hong Kong and on Nov. 21 a press report said attendance was falling below earlier government projections. On Nov. 22 Disney replied that ""well over"" 1 million people had visited HKD and that ""attendance is ramping up well."" ","Some 16,000 people attended the Disneyland opening. The park employed 5000 people and was predicted to draw 5.6 million people the first year. Two weeks after opening Disneyland activists were concerned about the harsh working conditions. Disney officials discouraged unionizing. The HKSAR government defended the park against the labor conditions, saying Disney needed time to learn the local culture. Two months after the park opened, Disneyland lowered the ticket price, denying it was related to low attendance, and refused to discuss attendance. The HKSAR government argued they should reveal attendance numbers to them because they were the largest Disneyland investor. ","HK and Disney agreed to build the park in 1999, with HK majority owner. Construction began in 2003. On opening day, Sept. 12, 2005, 16,000 people attended and demonstrators protested labor abuses at Chinese factories making Disney products. Park workers describe long hours, long travel times, harsh turnarounds and lack of breaks. Activists want HK Disneyland workers to unionize but Disney resists, despite unions at US and French Disneylands. Disney denies low attendance and is criticized for lack of transparency. Disney offered local residents discounted tickets. Mainland China, expected to be the major source of visitors, provided only 25 percent. ","Hong Kong Disneyland opened as scheduled on 12 September. Over 80% of the visitors in the first month rated their experience as very good or excellent. The park drew fewer visitors than expected in its first two months, despite offering a discount for HK residents.

The European-made space probe Huygens headed Saturday for a historicup-close encounter with Titan, the only celestial body of the Solarsystem with an atmosphere resembling that of Earth, after successfullyseparating from the US spacecraft Cassini.The mission may help prove, or disprove, a long-held hypothesis thatTitan may even have rain as well as lakes and rivers, albeitcontaining not water by unknown muddy substances.""The probe successfully detached from the Cassini orbiter,"" RosemarySullivant, a spokeswoman for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory inPasadena, California, told AFP in a brief telephone interview.""They received the signal, I think, at 7:24 (0324 GMT Saturday) thisevening Pacific time,"" she said.

With a gentle shove on Christmas Eve, the Cassini spacecraft willlaunch the European Space Agency's Huygens probe on a course thatshould send it plunging into the atmosphere of Saturn's big moonTitan.The probe must be released precisely on course because it has nomeans of maneuvering and will remain dormant until a timer wakes itup for entry into Titan's hazy, hydrocarbon-laced atmosphere and aparachute descent to the surface on Jan. 14.Confirmation of a successful release should be received by NASA'sDeep Space Network antennas in Spain and Goldstone, California, justbefore 0400 GMT Saturday (11 p.m. EST Friday), Jet PropulsionLaboratory said.The $3.3 billion (euro2.45 billion) Cassini-Huygens mission, aproject of NASA, ESA and the Italian space agency, was launched onOct. 15, 1997, from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to study Saturn, itsspectacular rings and many moons.During the nearly seven years Cassini took to reach the ringedplanet, the attached probe was powered through an umbilical cable andawakened from sleep mode every six months for tests.Cassini entered orbit around Saturn in June and has made severalpasses by Titan in preparation for the probe's release.Friday evening, tension-loaded springs will push Huygens away fromCassini on a free-fall toward Titan.On Monday, Cassini will perform a course change to avoid followingthe probe into Titan.Huygens is designed to make a 2 1/2-hour descent by parachute to thesurface of the moon, which, according to some theories, could havelakes of methane.Instruments aboard the probe will investigate the atmosphere'schemistry and cameras will try to record images of the surface. It'snot known whether Huygens will drop into liquid or onto a hardsurface, where it may operate for a few minutes.As long as it is operating, Huygens will be transmitting data back toCassini, which will later turn around to point its antenna at Earthand send the data to the Deep Space Network and on to ESA's SpaceOperations Center in Darmstadt, Germany.___On the Net:http://saturn.jpl.nasa.govhttp://www.nasa.gov/cassini
The international Cassini spacecraft launched a probe on a three-weekfree-fall toward Saturn's mysterious moon Titan, where it will plungeinto the hazy atmosphere and descend by parachute while its scienceinstruments and cameras make observations.The European Space Agency's Huygens probe is equipped withinstruments to sample the chemistry of the planet-size moon's thickatmosphere, and may reveal whether it actually has lakes or seas ofliquid methane and ethane that have been theorized by scientists.A signal confirming release of the probe was received at NASA's JetPropulsion Laboratory at 7:24 p.m. PST (0324 GMT Saturday). Theactual event occurred earlier, but it took more than an hour forradio signals to cross the hundreds of millions of miles betweenSaturn and Earth.Smiles broke out in the JPL control room where many members of themission staff wore red and white Santa hats.The aim had to be good because Huygens has no maneuvering system toadjust its own course, and it was designed to remain dormant untiljust before hitting Titan's atmosphere Jan. 14.""This was a big one partly because we had to do this right or nomission at all,"" said David Southwood, the ESA science programdirector. ""But there's still a lot to come. We've got a hell of along way to go.""A detailed analysis of data from the release was under way, but therewere no indications of any problems, said Earl Maize, the Cassinideputy program manager at JPL.""We are quite confident we had a very clean release,"" he said.Cassini was equipped with springs to gently push the 705-pound(320-kilogram) probe away at a rate of one foot per second and imparta stabilizing spin of seven revolutions per minute. Next week Cassiniwill make a course change to avoid following Huygens into Titan'satmosphere.Huygens was designed for only a brief mission. After entering theatmosphere it will deploy a huge parachute that will allow it to makea 2 1/2-hour descent while radioing findings back to Cassini.After touching down at 15 mph (24 kph), it may continue sending datafor up to 30 minutes, when either its battery fails or Cassinivanishes over Titan's horizon.Cassini will later turn its antenna toward Earth and send the databack to NASA's Deep Space Network and on to an ESA operations centerin Darmstadt, Germany.Titan is a key target of Cassini's $3.3 billion (euro2.4 billion)mission to study the Saturn system, which includes its spectacularrings and numerous moons. Scientists believe Titan may have organic _meaning carbon-based _ compounds similar those that existed on theearly Earth.Bigger than the planets Mercury and Pluto, Titan is the only moon inthe solar system known to have a significant atmosphere. Rich withnitrogen and containing about 6 percent methane, the atmosphere is 11/2 times thicker than Earth's.With the Saturn system averaging about 890 million miles (1.4 billionkilometers) from the sun, Titan has a surface temperature of minus290 degrees Fahrenheit (143 Celsius).That surface continues to puzzle scientists despite close flybys inwhich Cassini's cameras have tried to peer through Titan's smog-likehaze.Imaging scientists have discerned distinct dark and light-coloredareas, sometimes toying with such words as ""islands"" to describefeatures, but conceding they have yet to find a specific type ofreflection that would indicate areas of liquid.The Cassini mission is a joint project of NASA, ESA and the Italianspace agency. Cassini was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, onOct. 15, 1997, and arrived at Saturn in June.___On the Net:http://saturn.jpl.nasa.govhttp://www.nasa.gov/cassini
The Frisbee-shaped Huygens probe successfully separated from theCassini spacecraft Friday and began a risky 2.5-million-mile journeyto the surface of Saturn's bizarre, smog-choked moon Titan.Applause burst out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory shortly after7:24 p.m. PST, when scientists received word from NASA's Deep SpaceNetwork tracking stations in Spain and Goldstone, Calif., that theHuygens probe had cast off after a seven-year piggyback ride on theCassini spacecraft. All systems were said to have performed flawlesslyin the separation.``Today's release was another successful milestone in theCassini-Huygens odyssey,'' said David Southwood of the European SpaceAgency, which built the Huygens probe. ``Now all of our hopes andexpectations are focused on getting the first (close-up) data from anew world we've been dreaming of exploring for decades.''That data won't come for another three weeks, during which time the9-foot-diameter Huygens probe will chase down Titan and then, ifeverything goes as planned, hurl itself through the thick,nitrogen-methane atmosphere before crashing into a surface that couldconsist of anything from a sticky chemical sludge to poison oceans.Titan has beguiled scientists for years because it is unlike anyother place in the solar system. The only moon with an atmosphere,Titan is also of interest because it is thought to resemble the earlyEarth, before plant life formed and began pumping oxygen into theatmosphere.Too frigid at minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit to grow life itself,Titan is a kind of frozen museum piece of what an early, Earth-likeplanet might look like.The $3.2-billion Cassini mission is a cooperative venture betweenNASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. Thelargest and most ambitious interplanetary probe ever launched, the6-ton spacecraft lifted off Oct. 15, 1997. The mission involved 260scientists from 17 nations.Cassini reached Saturn in July, the first part of a two-partscientific exploration. Cassini first used its array of imagingdevices to take detailed pictures as it flew through the planet'sspectacular rings and swung past chilled and broken moons.In late October, Cassini passed within 745 miles of the surface ofTitan. Though the spacecraft's cameras were able to penetrate the hazein places, the images beamed back to earth only whetted scientists'appetites for the second part of the mission, Huygens' dramaticplunge.``Have we seen some craters? Perhaps. Some kind of flow on thesurface? Perhaps. Vulcanism? Perhaps,'' said Jean-Pierre Lebreton, theHuygens project manager for the European Space Agency.Answering those questions is the job of Huygens, a 700-poundcollection of scientific instruments designed to sniff and measure theatmosphere of Titan as it streaks to the surface. Although they areintrigued by images Cassini took in October of what looks to be anirregular land mass dubbed Xanadu, scientists said Friday that theyhad no fixed idea where the probe would land. Titan's strong windscould blow it hundreds of miles across the surface.Scientists are hoping the probe survives its landing long enough tosend back information about the surface of the moon.
Scientists have long thought thick clouds over Saturn's moon Titanrained methane through smoggy skies. Some believed the liquid pooledon the planet's surface, perhaps forming lakes or seas reminiscent ofEarth's.Recent images of the moon -- about half the size of Earth -- showdark regions next to a light one. Researchers, however, haven't beenable to figure out which is higher in elevation, let alone whatthey're made of.Space scientists hope to finally get some answers in three weeks whenthey send a space probe spinning down through the thick atmosphere ofa world more distant than any visited before.Friday holds a pivotal moment for Cassini, partly built in and partlycontrolled from Colorado and estimated to cost the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration and the European Space Agency$3.3 billion. Launched in 1997 and expected to collect pictures anddata until at least 2008, the spacecraft will fly 45 times by Titan,the only moon in the solar system with a significant atmosphere. Manyscientists suspect the moon has its own weather, as well as chemicalcycles similar to those on Earth, and can even help researchersunderstand how life originated here.From what scientists can tell, the chemical composition of Titan'satmosphere reflects what was on Earth several billion years ago, whenlife was just getting started, said Carolyn Porco, Cassini imagingleader and a researcher with the Space Science Institute in Boulder,Colo.""(Titan) doesn't have liquid water, because it's too cold ... butchemical processes that are happening slowly there might be similarto what happened on Earth,"" Porco said.""This will be like a Jules Verne adventure,"" she said. ""Maybe we'llsee cliffs and cracks, maybe we'll see meandering streams andvalleys. Or maybe we won't.""Sometime after 8 p.m. Friday, Cassini researchers scattered aroundthe world will watch as the landing probe Huygens separates from thespacecraft and heads toward the moon.If separation is successful, Huygens will spend three more weekssinking slowly toward Titan. On Jan. 14, it will float through theatmosphere on parachutes, shooting pictures for 2 1/2 hours before ithits the surface.Larry Esposito, a University of Colorado planetary scientist, saidhe's ""just burning with curiosity"" to see what's captured by theprobe's cameras, which were built by Lockheed Martin engineers inJefferson County.""I'm guessing it'll look a little like a bad day of skiing at Vail,when all the snow is dirty and hummocked, it's slushy and muddy, ...(and) maybe there's water underneath,"" Esposito said.Huygens, which can float, is designed to hit the planet's surface atless than 20 mph, he said, and it may be able to send pictures for ahalf hour from the ground, a lake or whatever else it encounters.Lockheed Martin engineer Chuck Rasbach helped design one of theHuygens cameras, which he called ""rugged, robust and compact.""The camera has been tested every six months on the seven-year journeyto Saturn, he said, and appears to be functioning well.Rasbach said he's proud to be part of the Cassini team, although themission isn't likely to have practical outcomes.""I wouldn't mind designing telephones, because it's practical, youuse a telephone every day,"" he said. ""With space, well, ... it moveshumanity forward.""
An instrumented space-faring emissary called Huygens will separateFriday night from the Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn and begin athree-week descent of nearly 2 million miles to the planet's weirdmoon Titan to sample its atmosphere and its puzzling surface.The risky mission, a joint project of NASA, the European Space Agencyand the Italian Space Agency, will mark the space era's first attemptto explore any planetary moon in the solar system since the sixhistoric Apollo landings on Earth's own satellite more than 30 yearsago.Giant Titan, 3,200 miles in diameter, is the only moon in the solarsystem with an atmosphere all its own -- a dense one that hasintrigued earthbound astronomers for decades.Mission engineers have programmed the adventure to begin precisely at7:08 PST Friday night, when three tiny pyrotechnic explosives onCassini's exterior must sever three tiny bolts simultaneously andrelease three tightly compressed springs in order to propel the705-pound, wok-shaped Huygens probe away from its mother ship andsend it on its long free fall through empty space to the mysterymoon.The springs are designed to give Huygens (pronounced HOY-ginz) ""agood spin"" -- seven revolutions per minute -- and thrust it into thevoid, first at less than 1 mph, but then quickly to a speed relativeto orbiting Cassini of about 13,500 mph, according to deputy missionoperations manager Earl Maize at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory inPasadena.""We tested and tested the system again and again long ago becausereleasing those springs simultaneously is critically important, andwe're confident it's ready,"" Maize said. ""We don't think there's anychance that Huygens will miss Titan, and we've factored in everythingwe know of the winds that might deflect the probe on its way throughTitan's atmosphere. It looks as though it will land within a few tensof meters of its planned landing site.""If the engineers have aimed correctly, Huygens will first reach thegiant moon's dense nitrogen-methane atmosphere and then its surfaceon Jan. 14 -- to radio back what its six instruments find there,hopefully for as long as two hours.Just what the probe will encounter -- a landing site marked byhard-frozen ice, lakes of liquid tar, ancient craters drowned inoozing chemical slush, or volcanoes spouting organic ices -- remainsunknown to astronomers waiting all over the world.At least as intriguing as the nature of the moon's surface is theprecise composition of Titan's smoggy, 12-layered atmosphere, whichmany believe may closely resemble the mix of gases that early Earthpossessed -- rich in the organic chemicals essential for life toemerge and evolve.With Cassini moving on its regular programmed orbit around Saturnthis week, engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory signaled thespacecraft Tuesday to perform its eighth and final ""orbit deflectionmaneuver,"" altering its flight path slightly and putting it on adirect collision course for Titan.The mission controllers also started timers on Cassini to set theprecise moment at which the Huygens probe will be released from theorbiter and sent on its own ballistic trajectory -- with no abilityto steer itself -- toward the planned landing site.The location is marked by what Cassini's cameras have seen asinterlocking light and dark areas, which may be plateaus next tomountain spires or low-lying solids or even liquids.""It all looks good, and we've a green light to proceed,"" saidJean-Pierre Lebreton, the Huygens probe's chief scientist and missionmanager in an interview during the recent San Francisco meeting ofthe American Geophysical Union.Despite the mission's unprecedented audacity and technicalcomplexity, the teams of scientists and engineers are confident thatHuygens will reach its target and perform its tasks of analyzing theatmosphere and the surface at its landing site.If all goes well, Cassini will signal within seconds of itsprogrammed release sequence that the launch of Huygens has beensuccessful. But that message -- traveling at the speed of light --will take one hour, seven minutes and 39 seconds to reach the eagerscientists and engineers at JPL and the European Space Agency'scontrol center in Darmstadt, Germany.Then, as the Huygens probe falls toward the top of Titan'sperceptible atmosphere, 789 miles above the surface, its twotransmitters, each with its own antenna, will signal its progress toCassini, and the orbiter will record the messages for latertransmission to Earth.After Huygens has arrived at its target, mission engineers will alterCassini's course once again so it is no longer on its collisioncourse toward Titan and return it to its regular orbit around Saturnand its schedule of 45 more sweeping observation flights past theintriguing moon over the next four years.Cassini, with the Huygens probe riding piggy-back, was launched fromCape Canaveral aboard a Titan 4-B rocket on Oct. 15, 1997. It flewtwice past Venus, once past Earth and once past Jupiter and traveleda total of 2.2 billion miles before passing through Saturn's ringsand swinging into its first orbit around the planet on July 1.The European Space Agency built and managed the development ofHuygens and directs the probe's operations. The Italian Space Agencyprovided Cassini's high-gain antenna, much of its radio system andcrucial parts for several of Cassini's science instruments.The probe was named after Christiaan Huygens, the 17th century Dutchmathematician and physicist who discovered Titan in 1655 and examinedSaturn's rings in great detail.The planned cost of the entire joint mission is $3.2 billion. Thatincludes the roughly $500 million cost of the Huygens probe, which isbeing borne by many of the European Space Agency's members.
After a seven-year journey, a saucer-shaped probe prepared Fridaynight to detach itself from the Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn todive toward one of the most mysterious bodies in the solar system:the giant moon Titan.If successful, the Huygens probe will be the first spacecraft tovisit Titan, whose dense atmosphere and apparent soup of organicchemicals have led scientists to compare it to conditions on a youngEarth, just before life began.Though astronomers have spent decades examining Titan from Earth andspace, even basic facts about the moon remain unknown. It is the onlymoon in the solar system with a substantial atmosphere, butscientists can only guess what kind of surface will greet Huygens --a sea of liquid methane, ice, or a strange hydrocarbon.""It is bizarre, with so much scrutiny for so much time, Titan isalmost (more) mysterious now than when we started this project,"" saidJohn Zarnecki, a lead investigator for the Huygens mission of TheOpen University in England. ""The whole thing is pretty crazy.""Huygens's suicide plunge is the most dramatic moment planned for thefour years the spacecraft Cassini will spend circling the planet andits 31 known moons. Cassini, which arrived in Saturn's orbit earlierthis year, has already discovered several moons and has sent backsome of the most detailed pictures of Saturn's elaborate rings.After it detaches from Cassini, the 9-foot Huygens probe will falltoward Titan and, if all goes as planned, enter the moon's opaqueatmosphere Jan. 14. The sturdy probe will have to endure temperaturesof about 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit from atmospheric friction duringits entry. Three parachutes will deploy, allowing the probe, which isdesigned primarily to study the atmosphere, to spend 2 1/2 hoursmeasuring temperature, wind speed, pressure, and atmosphericcomposition, all while snapping more than 1,100 pictures. Its time inthe spotlight will be short-lived, however -- when and if it lands,Huygens will have at most only two more hours on the surface beforeCassini moves out of contact and Huygens loses touch with Earth.These are tense times for NASA and the 16 European nations involvedin the $3.27 billion Cassini-Huygens project, named for two17th-century astronomers. Some scientists, such as Zarnecki, havebeen working on the project for more than 15 years -- and areunlikely to have another chance for a direct visit to such a distantbody.The mission follows a tumultuous two years at the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration, during which occurred theColumbia shuttle tragedy, a successful robotic landing on Mars, and,more recently, a largely failed attempt to bring back solar particlesfrom space.The elaborate and expensive Cassini-Huygens project, launched in1997, is a dramatic departure from NASA's recent mantra of ""faster,better, cheaper,"" and, if successful, will probably serve as a modelfor more ambitious exploration projects.Cassini's findings from Saturn itself may help scientists betterunderstand the origin of the solar system, but it is on Titan wherethey hope to find more specific clues to the origin of life. Previousobservations have suggested that the moon has a hazy atmosphere oforganic matter and a possibly rich top layer filled with carbon-basedcompounds of the kind that were on Earth at the time when life isthought to have arisen. Earth's biological and geological processeshave erased the evidence from those early years, so scientists' besthope is to analyze similar conditions on another planetary body, suchas Titan. The moon's frigid temperatures -- estimated to be aroundminus 290 degrees Fahrenheit -- make Titan an inhospitableenvironment for life, but may have helped preserve concentrations oforganic matter similar to those on Earth before life began.One of the great mysteries of the Huygens visit will be what kind oflandscape greets the probe. Some scientists have speculated thatorganic material in Titan's atmosphere drifts to the surface and thenreturns to the air, much as oceans send water vapor into the Earth'satmosphere. Zarnecki, who designed the probe's surface scientificinstruments, says he hopes to find a deep sea of liquid methane andethane.""It could be the first time we've done oceanography somewhere else,""said Zarnecki.If there is wind, some astronomers say, Titan's relatively weakgravity could mean waves could reach hundreds of feet high, slowlymoving across its surface. Scientists have not seen any meteoritecraters on the surface but suspect they could exist, buried under alake or a gooey mixture of organic matter.""We don't know yet,"" said Jonathan Lunine of the University ofArizona, a planetary scientist working on the mission. Recentpictures of Titan taken by the Cassini orbiter seem to suggestHuygens may land on a solid surface, but scientists say they will notknow until they get there. In addition to climate history, Luninesays he wants to study ""simple nonbiological chemistry"" there inhopes of understanding how nonliving compounds could make thetransition to life.Zarnecki and other scientists have equipped the 700-pound stationaryprobe well: Huygens can measure its tilt to figure out if it lands onsolid or liquid. The probe could probably float on a methane lake andhas sonar that may be able to measure depth if it lands on liquid, oreven the distance to nearby rocks to measure the terrain if it landson solid ground.Whatever it does will have to happen quickly: If Huygens landssuccessfully, probably somewhere near Titan's equator, it will haveno more than two hours to study the moon's surface before its onlylink to Earth -- Cassini -- disappears over the horizon.By the time the orbiter comes around again weeks later, Huygens'sbatteries will be frozen solid.

The European-built space probe Huygens separated from its NASAmothership late Friday to begin a descent to Saturn's largest moonTitan, during which it will sample the atmosphere of Titan.NASA said in an online news release that its Deep Space Networktracking stations in Madrid, Spain and Goldstone, California,received the signal at about 10:24 p.m. EST (0324 GMT).Titan is the only moon that has an atmosphere in the Solar system.Its chemistry is believed to be very similar to that of early Earthbefore life formed. And scientists hope the on-site probe by Huygenswould confirm the assumption and help them to better understand howlife appears on Earth.

And scientists hope the on- site probeby Huygens would confirm the assumption and help them betterunderstand how life appeared on the Earth.The trip by Huygens is also expected to answer the question thatwhether there is any liquid on Titan's surface. Scientists believethere are methane lakes on Titan.The 2.7-meter wide Huygens is planned to reach Titan's upperatmosphere on Jan. 14, 2005 and go through the atmosphere in two anda half hours. Three parachutes will slow its descent so that theinstruments it carries can have enough time to take detailedreadings.After reaching the surface of Titan, if it would be solid, Huygens isdesigned to operate for a brief period of time, possibly only 30minutes, before its battery power runs out.The Huygens probe, designed and built by the European Space Agency,had been carried by NASA's Saturn probe Cassini, which entered theorbit of Saturn on June 30 after a nearly seven-year journey in thespace.
","At 10:24 p.m. EST on December 24,2004, NASA's Deep Space tracking stations received a signal that the space probe, Huygens, had separated from its mothership to begin a descent to Saturn's largest moon, Titan. Huygens would spend three weeks descending toward Titan, shooting pictures for 2-1/2 hours before hitting the surface. Titan is the only moon in the Solar System that has an atmosphere. During the seven years mothership Cassini took to reach the ringed planet, the attached Huygens probe was powered through an umbilical cable and awakened from sleep mode every six months for tests. ","After a seven-year journey, the Huygens space probe successfully separated from the Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn at about 10:24 p.m. EST December 24, beginning its three-week, 2 million-mile free fall toward Saturn's moon Titan. It will remain dormant until January 14, when it will float to the moon's surface on parachutes, shooting pictures and sending back data for about 2.5 hours before hitting the surface. Scientists hope Huygens will confirm the assumption that Titan's atmosphere is similar to that of early Earth. The mission is a joint project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. 
","Huygens is a 9-foot landing probe, built by the European Space Agency. It is riding on the Cassini spacecraft, launched from Cape Canaveral on October 15, 1997. Cassini flew twice past Venus, once past Earth, and once past Jupiter - 2.2 billion miles - before its first orbit around Saturn began on July 1, 2004. It continued these orbits until December 24. On that date, Huygens separated from the mother ship and began a forecasted 20-day, 2.5 million mile ballistic path to Titan, the most intriguing moon of Saturn. Huygens is designed to study Titan's atmosphere and take photographs. ","The Huygens space probe, built and managed by the European Space Agency, was carried by NASA's Cassini spacecraft on a 7-year journey to Saturn. It separated successfully from Cassini on Christmas Eve and began a 2.5-million-mile 20-day descent to Saturn's largest moon Titan, the only moon in the solar system that has atmosphere. During its descent it will sample Titan's atmosphere. Everything must work perfectly because there is no way to adjust Huygens' course. Progress was being carefully followed by NASA and the 16 European nations involved in the project. "
D0941,D0941-B,"The European-US mission to explore the Saturnian moon Titan is ""a scientific success,"" the director-general of the European Space Agency (ESA), Jean-Jacques Dordain, announced here Friday.Scientists are receiving a stream of data sent back to Earth by the US orbiter Cassini, which was relaying a transmission by the European exploratory probe Huygens, he said.""Cassini has started delivering data,"" Dordain told reporters. ""We hope to have the first results tonight.""He described the mission as ""a fantastic success for Europe.""Huygens plunged to the surface of Titan earlier Friday, carrying instruments to assess the moon's weather system and methane-rich atmosphere during a two-and-a-half-hour parachute glide.
A European robot lab parachuted to the surface of the Saturn moon Titan on Friday, successfully climaxing a venture to explore one of the most beguiling phenomena in the Solar System, mission leaders here said.Operating in the dark and friendless chill of deep space, the unmanned probe Huygens glided to Titan's surface, relaying its findings to its American mothership Cassini, which then sent the data home to NASA's waiting radio sentinels.Joy erupted at mission control as the precious data poured in.Scientists and space chiefs have bet more than three billion dollars on the Cassini-Huygens project and some have spent a quarter-century of their lives planning it and carrying it out.Huygens is ""a scientific success ... and a fantastic success as well for international cooperation,"" the director-general of the European Space Agency (ESA), Jean-Jacques Dordain, declared.The probe headed to Titan's surface carrying half a dozen instruments within a clam-like shell to film and measure the moon's weather system and methane-rich atmosphere during a two-and-a-half-hour descent.Its sensors were designed to continue working for just three minutes after it landed on the bone-freezing Titan surface.But delighted scientists said the instruments probably continued to function for at least half an hour after touchdown, possibly providing vital clues as to whether Titan is covered by rock, methane ice or an ocean of chemicals.""I am sure we have at least 30 minutes of surface science,"" said Jean-Pierre Lebreton, head of the Huygens mission at ESA.Titan, the largest satellite of Saturn, was chosen for the 3.2-billion-dollar (2.46-billion-euro) transatlantic venture as, intriguingly, it is the only moon in the Solar System that has a substantial atmosphere.Its thick mix of nitrogen and methane is suspected to be undergoing chemical reactions similar to those that unfolded on Earth billions of years ago. That process eventually provided the conditions for life on our planet.""Titan is a time machine. It will especially provide us with the opportunity to know about the conditions on our early Earth,"" Alphonso Diaz, NASA Science assistant administrator, said.Huygen's descent, on a moon 1.5 billion kilometers (940 million miles) from home,  was the farthest landing from Earth ever attempted.The operation was fraught with potential hitches, including the risk of a crash or catastrophic malfunction when the 319-kilo (702-pound) craft entered Titan's roiling atmosphere.Cassini had given Huygens a piggyback ride to Saturn and its moon system.Their epic seven-year trip, covering 2.1 billion kilometers (1.3 billion miles), culminated last July.Dordain described Friday's outcome as ""a fantastic success for Europe, first of all for European industry which delivered a very complex machine. It worked beautifully with six scientific instruments, in a very harsh environment in order to break the secret of Titan.""But it was also ""a fantastic success as well for international cooperation,"" said Dordain. ""We should learn lessons from this success. Lessons don't come only from failure.""German Research Minister Edelgard Buhlman was equally overjoyed, hailing the mission as ""one of the greatest events in space science and technology.""The chemical processes believed to be unfolding on `Titan may give clues as to how life took root on Earth.But life -- or at least life as we understand it -- is unlikely to exist on Titan itself, given that it is so far from Sun, receiving negligible solar heat and light. The moon's surface temperature is estimated to be -180 Celsius (-292 Fahrenheit).After Friday's drama, Cassini will pursue its four-year mission map Saturn, the second largest planet of the Solar System, and its leading satellites. Huygens is named after the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, who discovered Titan in 1655. Cassini's name comes from the Italian Jean-Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), who discovered the Saturnian satellites Iapetus, Rhea, Tethys and Dione.In 1675, he discovered what is called the ""Cassini Division,"" the gap between Saturn's rings.
(c) 2005, Newsday=Touchdown!After a seven-year-trip through outer space, the Huygens spaceprobe successfully completed the last leg of its epic voyage to Titanon Friday, releasing initial black and white images that brought tearsto the eyes of the mission's scientists.Taken from 10 miles above Saturn's mysterious moon, one pictureshows what appear to be short drainage channels heading to acoastline, perhaps carved by liquids such as methane. Another image,from five miles above Titan, portrays what researchers said might beflooded plains and shorelines. A third depicts a surface strewn withblocks of frozen liquid.Scientists said they were ``astonished'' by the images. Hundredsmore are expected.``My initial reaction on seeing these pictures was `Wow! Look atthat, it worked,' '' said NASA's Robert Mitchell, program manager forthe international Cassini program that delivered the probe to Titan.The scientific feat, 25 years in the making, represents thefarthest from Earth that a spacecraft has ever landed, about 890million miles away. Researchers believe Saturn's hazy moon may mirrorconditions of an early Earth ``in deep freeze,'' with some scientistsspeculating on the existence of everything from icy methane lakes andan organic compound-rich smog to ``continents'' of rock and ice andfierce lightning and thunderstorms. A slew of photo and sensor datasent back to Earth may now begin answering those questions.Three weeks after detaching from NASA's Cassini spacecraft andhurtling toward the gargantuan moon, Huygens completed its journeythrough Titan's thick atmosphere in slightly less than 2 1/2 hours,said the agency's researchers. In comments to the media, Mitchell saidall of the probe's precious photo and sensor data had been relayed toCassini within minutes of its landing.Crowded into the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt,Germany, scientists joined journalists in peering at banks of computermonitors throughout the day. With confirmation that the first data hadarrived from the probe via Cassini, the control room burst intocheers, with researchers hugging one another and smiling broadly.``So we are the very first visitors of Titan and that scientificdata that we are collecting now shall unveil the secrets of this newworld,'' declared a jubilant Jean-Jacques Dordain, ESA's directorgeneral, in a briefing broadcast live on NASA TV. The Cassini-Huygensmission, jointly sponsored by ESA, NASA, and the Italian Space Agency,will live on through the Cassini mothership, slated to exploreSaturn's planetary system for four more years.The first sighs of relief arrived when the Robert C. Byrd GreenBank Telescope of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in GreenBank, W.Va., detected a faint signal coming from the probe during itsdescent. This ``carrier'' signal, similar to the dial tone of atelephone, indicated the heat shield covering the back of Huygens hadbeen ejected, the main parachute had been deployed, the batteries hadswitched on, and the probe had begun transmitting data.The 705-pound probe, elated researchers said, was ``alive.''His voice choked with emotion, NASA Associate Administrator ofScience Alphonso Diaz saluted the ``tremendous success'' of thecooperative effort. ``There will only be one first successful landingon Titan and this was it,'' said the 20-year project veteran.David Southwood, director of ESA's scientific program, said hedoubted whether a repeat landing on Titan would occur within thelifetime of anyone at the briefing. ``So this is the data,'' he said.``It's for posterity and it's for mankind.''It is also, he concluded, only the beginning.
A European spacecraft landed safely Friday on thesurface of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, scientists here said, andbegan transmitting data back to Earth.Mission controllers said they were confident the Huygens craft made asoft landing by parachute because it was still transmitting signalslong after its scheduled touchdown at about 1:30 p.m. (8:30a.m. Eastern time).""We know it has landed based on the laws of gravity,""the European Space Agency's science director, David Southwood, said.""It simply cannot still be flying. It's got to be ona solid surface, and it must be soft.""It is the first landing of a spacecraft on the moonof another planet. And Titan is no ordinary moon, buta body larger than the planets Mercury and Pluto, andalmost the size of Mars.The first data from Huygens came before noon Eastern time, andpictures are expected later.Even on Titan's surface, the craft's batteries will be running low-- time enough for no more than 30 minutes totwo hours of observations and picture-taking.On Thursday Dr. Jean-Pierre Lebreton, the mission manager at the EuropeanSpace Operations Center here, said, ""I'm quite confident we willhave something special.""At a news briefing Thursday, Dr. Martin G. Tomasko of theUniversity of Arizona, a Huygens scientist, said the craft's cameraand science instruments were expected to provide ""a spectacularly newview of Titan and an understanding of this mysterious world.""Scientists were hoping to get their first peek inside one ofthe most intriguing atmospheres in the solar system.Its dense hydrocarbon smog suggests complex chemical processes like those thatled to life on Earth. Tomasko said previous observations indicatedthat the atmosphere would appear green at higher altitudes andthen turn orange closer to the surface.This atmosphere has also been frustrating. The perpetual smoggy veil haslimited any view of Titan's surface to little more thana vague patchwork of light and dark regions, with onlysome hints of rugged topography.The mission by the 700-pound Huygens, built and operated by theEuropean Space Agency, is part of a $3.2 billion undertakingby the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, ESA and theItalian Space Agency.Huygens (named for the 17th-century Dutch astronomer) rode piggyback on NASA'ssix-ton Cassini spacecraft for the seven-year journey to the wide-rangingorbit of Saturn. On the night of Dec. 24-25, Cassinireleased its fellow traveler for its solo cruise on coursefor Titan and is now in a position to relayall the data sent from Huygens during the descent andlanding.The possibility remains that a design flaw in Cassini's radio receiversystem will hopelessly scramble the data. Engineers anticipated that signalsfrom the wind-tossed Huygens would vary widely in frequency andstrength, and thus compensated for it in the receiver's design.But they had failed to take into account frequency shiftsthat would also throw off the timing of the encodeddata, leaving it a garbled mess.In early 2000, an ESA engineer recognized the problem. Finally, ESAand NASA engineers found a way to reduce the frequencyshifts to acceptable levels by altering the trajectory and orientationof Cassini during the critical maneuvers.
A European spacecraft plunged through the murky atmosphereof Saturn's moon Titan on Friday and successfully came torest on a bizarre landscape never before explored.Astronomers expressed joy at achieving the first landing on another planet'smoon, particularly Titan, the only moon in the solar systemto have a substantial atmosphere.""We clearly have a success,"" said Dr. Jean-Jacques Dordain, director generalof the European Space Agency. ""This is a fantastic successfor Europe.""The first pictures from the spacecraft, Huygens, did nothing to underminethe reputation of Titan as a strange place. One showedterrain of what appeared to be deep channels leading tothe shoreline of a dark, flat surface, possibly a lakeof liquid methane.""Clearly there is liquid matter flowing on the surface of Titan,""said Dr. Martin G. Tomasko of the University of Arizona,an imaging specialist for the mission. That possibility has tantalizedscientists, who say Titan may resemble Earth early in itsdevelopment and could give clues to the origin of lifehere.The black and white pictures, taken as Huygens descended, were aforetaste of more highly processed color pictures that are expectedto be made public on Saturday, Tomasko said.At 5:13 p.m. local time (11:13 a.m. ET), cheers went uphere at the European Space Operations Center as the engineeringand scientific data arrived, a seal of mission success.Although the Huygens spacecraft was part of the $3.2 billion Cassinimission to Saturn in partnership with the United States, theEuropeans saw it as a particularly challenging engineering endeavor thatcould elevate their reputation as major players in space technology.The American-built Cassini spacecraft may have delivered Huygens to thethreshold of its achievement, but a spacecraft built in Europeand directed here became the first to land on themoon of another planet.It is a feat that, as Dr. David Southwood, the spaceagency's director of science programs, said, is ""not likely tobe repeated in the lifetime of anyone alive today --so this is a really historic event.""And so, the Huygens team put scientific interpretation aside and enjoyeda triumph that was a long time coming.""You can probably detect a certain relief on my face,"" Southwoodsaid, and he was not alone in the control roomsat Darmstadt.
Punching through haze and history, a European space probelanded on Saturn's major moon Friday and revealed a frigidrealm of apparent rivers and lakes that seemed both familiarand fascinating to astronomers.The first look at Titan from the European Space Agency's Huygensprobe also showed icy boulders on rugged terrain and ignitedcelebratory glee among scientists at the Germany-based control center andin other parts of the world.""You can almost imagine yourself standing on the surface, looking outand surveying the scene,"" said University of Arizona planetary scientistMartin Tomasko, the chief of the probe's camera team. ""Iwas struck by how similar the landscape looks to whatwe might see on the Earth, what we have seenon Mars, what we have seen on a variety ofplanets.""The Huygens probe's parachute descent through Titan's thick smoggy atmosphere delivereda drama-filled conclusion to a more than seven-year journey thatbegan when NASA launched the $3.4 billion Cassini mission toSaturn.The saucer-shaped spacecraft represented a $500 million contribution to the 19-nationmission from the European Space Agency, which orchestrated the landingfrom Darmstadt, Germany.In a continuing search for what Titan and Earth have incommon, mission experts will sift through more images for severaldays from a moon that is slightly smaller than Marsand 750 million miles from Earth. Studies of the imageryand environmental readings gathered by Huygens will likely continue foryears.But just as the first images last year from the Marsrovers kept NASA scientists busy for months, Friday's first snapshotsamounted to a sneak preview. The black and white imagessuggested a lunar surface with bright elevated land masses, groovedby sloping drainage channels and seemingly surrounded by dark, stillpools of oily liquid.Scientists speculated that torrents of grimy methane or ethane rain shovedthe boulders down to the spacecraft's equatorial landing site.Huygens is named for the Dutch scientist who discovered Titan in1655. But the moon had evaded close scrutiny until thefirst of NASA's Voyager probes cruised by in 1980. Theflyby revealed a thick atmosphere of nitrogen that scientists believedcould harbor environmental conditions similar to those on Earth beforelife emerged.Cassini began orbiting Saturn in late June as part of afour-year mission to study the distant planet's ring system andmore than 30 moons.A vexing petroleum haze of methane, ethane and traces of othercarbon-rich gases obscured the true nature of Titan even fromCassini's cameras and cloud-piercing radar.Huygens, which separated from Cassini last month, offered a 20-fold improvementin detail as it drifted nearly 2 1/2 hours beforetouching down. Even on the surface, Huygens kept taking picturesuntil its batteries died.""This is really, really astonishing,"" said Jean-Pierre Lebreton, the Huygens missionchief scientist and one of the first researchers to suggestthat methane and ethane would be stable as liquids evenat the 300-degree-below temperatures on the moon's surface.""I just love the idea of there being liquid down there,""said David Southwood, the European Space Agency's chief scientist. ""Ifthere is liquid down there, it is going to evaporate,it's going to rain, do all those things we knowand love on the Earth.""Friday's landing marked the pinnacle of achievement in space for theEuropean Space Agency.""Just incredible,"" said an emotional Al Diaz, NASA's associate administrator forspace science. ""There will be only one first landing onTitan. This was it, and the European Space Agency deservesa tremendous amount of credit.""
A space probe landed on the surface ofa moon about 800 million miles away from Earth earlyFriday, extending the reach of humans deep into the solarsystem and giving scientists their first look at a mysteriousworld thought to be similar to primitive Earth.The first black-and-white images from Saturn's moon Titan drew gasps froma few dozen researchers gathered in a University of Coloradoauditorium to watch NASA television Friday afternoon.In one, snapped from about 12 miles above the moon's surface,channels appeared to be cut through a light, billowy surface,separated from a darker, smoother region by a ""shoreline.""In another, shot from the mysterious moon's surface, were rock-like blobs,perhaps balls of frozen liquids or ""ice boulders.""The moon's surface seemed less alien than many suspected, showing erodedsurfaces reminiscent of box canyons, and boulders that looked likethose on Mars.""Wow. I was not expecting to see an image that diverse,""said CU planetary scientist Josh Colwell. ""Something is flowing there,""he said, pointing to dark streaks cutting through lighter billowson the first image.""The terrain looks, maybe, like it's been snowed on.""NASA's Cassini spacecraft, which spent seven years traveling to Saturn, releasedthe European Space Agency's Huygens probe, carrying Colorado-made instruments, onChristmas Eve. Early Friday morning, the probe spun through Titan'satmosphere, slowed by parachutes that appeared to perform perfectly.Titan is the first moon other than Earth's to be explored.Scientists believe its atmosphere is similar to that of the youngEarth, and that studying it could provide clues to howlife arose here.""I think all of us continue to be amazed as wewatch our solar system unveil,"" NASA science administrator Alphonso Diazsaid as the extraordinary images were displayed on screens atmission control in Darmstadt.""It challenges all our preconceptions that all these planets are staticplaces. Seeing a planet emerge that has dynamics and complexityto it is just amazing.""Huygens was spun off from the Cassini mother ship on Dec.24 before its descent to the surface of Titan.The $3.3 billion mission is a joint effort byamong NASA, theEuropean Space Agency and the Italian space agency.Scientists say they received more than three hours of data fromHuygens' descent, and more than 10 minutes of data fromthe surface itself.At mission control in Germany, scientists shook hands and hugged eachother as they confirmed data were streaming back to Earthfrom 800 million miles away. NASA science administrator Alphonso Diazheld back tears. ""Incredible,"" he said.Boulder researcher Carolyn Porco, also in Germany for the Huygens landing,marveled that people have now put their mark on sucha distant world.""When we look in the skies and see Saturn, now wecan say we've been there,"" said Porco, with Boulder's SpaceScience Institute and the leader of the mission's imaging team.
The European built space probe Huygens Friday emitted its first signal during its final descent toward the Saturn's largest moon Titan after a seven years' interplanetary trip, announced an official of the European Space Agency (ESA).""The baby is alive"", announced David Southwood, director of Sciences of ESA from the control center of ESA in Darmstadt, Germany.The signal emitted by the probe was captured by the radiotelescope of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at Green Bank in Virginia, said another ESA official, Martin Ransom.Huygens' final descent towards Titan started at 1013 GMT and isplanned to land on the moon at around 1234GMT. During the descending process, it will film Titan's surface, measure wind speed and pressure and analyze the atmosphere as it descends to the surface.Titan was chosen for the mission since it is the only moon in the Solar System that has a substantial atmosphere.
European space probe Huygens has landed safely on the surface of Saturn's moon Titan, an official from the European Space Agency said Friday.Mission controllers know the Huygens probe made a soft landing by parachute because it is still transmitting steadily long after it had to have landed, David Southwood, the European Space Agency's science director, said in Darmstadt, Germany.
The European built space probe Huygens has sent back the first 350 pictures of the Saturn's moon Titan, the European Space Agency (ESA) announced on Friday night.The first picture was taken from the height of about 16 km, as Huygens descended before landing on the surface of Titan, the largest satellite of Saturn, and it showed a possibly rocky surface with ""drainage channels"" for liquids.""This is absolutely a raw picture, but it has wonderful clarity,"" said Marty Tomasko, an Arizona University imaging specialist, pointing to what looks like ""drainage channels, canyons, also maybe a shoreline.""After an interplanetary trip of over seven years, the probe Huygens landed earlier Friday on the Titan surface. Huygens' descent, on a moon about 1.5 billion km from the Earth, is the most distant ever attempted in the solar system.The saucer-shaped probe then registered data and transmitted them home via the mother spacecraft Cassini, marking the success of the Cassini-Huygens mission worth a total of 3.2 billion US dollars.The mission, a joint project of NASA, ESA and the Italian SpaceAgency, was launched on Oct. 15, 1997 from Cape Canaveral, in Florida to study Saturn, its rings and moons.Huygens was separated from its mother ship Cassini on Dec. 25 after a seven-year journey to begin its free-fall toward Titan.Named after Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, the probe's final descent toward Titan started at 1013 GMT on Friday. During the descending process of two hours and a half, it began to film Titan's surface, measure wind speed and pressure and analyze the atmosphere.Titan was chosen for the mission since it is the only moon in the Solar System that has a substantial atmosphere.Scientists believe the organic chemical reactions taking place on Titan resemble the processes that gave rise to life on the Earth 4 billion years ago.
","Descending through poisonous haze, the Huygens space probe landed on Titan January 14, 2005. Photographs it took near the surface revealed a frigid realm of apparent rivers, lakes and icy boulders. Scientists were ecstatic at having achieved the first spacecraft landing on the moon of another planet. The scientific feat, 25 years in the making, represented the farthest from Earth that a spacecraft had ever landed, about 890 million miles away. Titan's dense hydrocarbon smog suggests complex chemical processes like those that led to life on Earth. European scientists built Huygens to learn more by probing the moon's surface. ","The European-built Huygens space probe landed safely on Titan's surface as scheduled on January 14. Mission controllers were confident it landed on a solid, soft surface. It continued to send back pictures and data after the landing, and would continue to do so until its batteries ran out. The initial black and white images of Titan's surface sent by Huygens before noon EST astonished scientists. The scientific feat, 25 years in the making, represents the farthest from Earth that a spacecraft has landed. It also is the first landing of a spacecraft on the moon of another planet. ","Huygens landed safely on an apparently solid, but soft surface of Titan on January 14. The first photographs brought gasps and cheers from the scientists. They appeared to reveal drainage channels, flooded plains, shore lines, and a surface strewn with frozen blocks. Huygens had gathered environment data and photographs for 3 hours during its descent and for 10 minutes on the surface before the batteries died. The mission was declared a fantastic success and its output will be studied for years. ","The Huygens probe is ""a fantastic success for Europe."" During the 2-1/2-hour descent through Titan's atmosphere, it filmed Titan's surface, measured wind speed and pressure, and analyzed the atmosphere. The first pictures, taken from a height of about 10 miles as Huygens descended, showed a strange, rugged terrain with drainage channels for liquids. The probe landed safely on the surface at about 1234 GMT on 14 January and the sensors, which were expected to work for only three minutes after landing, continued to function for at least 30 minutes.

D0942,D0942-A,"China Tuesday said that ""one country, two systems"" is its basic approach to Taiwan as it outlined for the first time its anti-secession law aimed at the island.
An official of the Cabinet-level MainlandAffairs Council (MAC) said Wednesday that the government will closelymonitor developments in mainland China's communications with theUnited States about its plan to enact an anti-secession law.MAC Deputy Chairman Chiu Tai-shan made the remarks a day afterChen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under Beijing'sState Council, arrived in Washington to discuss with U.S. officialsthe details of the planned anti-secession law targeting Taiwan.The mainland's plan to promulgate an anti-secession law is notonly a tremendous provocation of Taiwan but also a unilateral move tochange the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, Chiu told reporters.Chiu said that the MAC, the top agency in charge of Taiwan'spolicies toward the mainland, has expressed on public occasions itsstrong opposition to the legislation aimed at legalizing Beijing'sinvasion of the country.Stressing that Taiwan is not part of the People's Republic ofChina as the Beijing authorities claim, Chiu said this is also thefeeling of a majority of the people of Taiwan.Meanwhile, Michel Lu, spokesman of the Ministry of ForeignAffairs, said that officials of the Republic of China representativeoffice in the United States will keep a close eye on developments.The government will also continue to express its opposition tothe proposed anti-secession law, which, if passed, would offer alegal basis for Beijing to use force against Taiwan, Lu went on.The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC)agreed in late December to submit the draft bill to a NPC plenarysession for deliberation in March this year.
President Chen Shui-bian called for thenation Friday to seriously face Beijing's proposed anti-secession lawwhich he said would undermine stability across the Taiwan Strait ifenacted.The president made the remarks while reviewing the operations andcapability of an army unit in Pingtung, southern Taiwan.Chen said that Beijing has been actively engaging in""psychological, legal and media warfare"" in pushing to enact theanti-secession law, which he said is aimed at establishing a legaljustification for a military invasion of Taiwan.The National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee late lastyear placed the anti-secession bill on the agenda for the annualsession of the NPC set for this March.The president reiterated remarks he made in his New Year'saddress in which he condemned Beijing's plans to enact ananti-secession law as a unilateral attempt to change the status quoin the Taiwan Strait. Chen called the proposed law the biggest threatto regional stability and peace in the world.
The enacting of an anti-secession law byBeijing will diminish cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges and thus will beharmful to the development of bilateral ties, a scholar said Monday.Shu Yung-ming, an assistant researcher with Academia Sinica,Taiwan's highest research institute, said in a seminar that thepeople of Taiwan will be afraid of visiting the mainland after thelegislation is approved due to its ambiguous definition ofsecessionist activities.The people of Taiwan could be arrested when visiting the mainlandbecause of remarks they might make in Taiwan and other areas that areconsidered by the Beijing authorities as violations of the proposedlaw, he explained.Besides, he went on, none of the candidates running for publicoffice in Taiwan can avoid expressing their opposition to theproposed law during their campaigns under the country's currentpolitical circumstances.Furthermore, he continued, the enacting of the anti-secession lawwill squeeze the political space of those who actually supportTaiwan's reunification with the mainland.
Both the United States and the EuropeanUnion think mainland China's planned anti-secession legislation iscounterproductive to peace across the Taiwan Strait, Minister ofForeign Affairs Tan Sun Chen said Monday.Chen made the remarks after presiding over a Lunar New Yeargathering at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) auditorium.He said the government sent six delegations to the United States,Japan and EU countries last year to brief officials, academics andopinion leaders on the adverse impact on cross-strait relations ofBeijing's planned anti-secession law, which targets Taiwan.The MOFA has also instructed embassies and representative officesabroad to express to their host governments Taiwan's opposition tothe proposed legislation, Chen said.The mainland's rubber-stamp parliament -- the National People'sCongress -- is scheduled to screen the so-called anti-secession lawin March. Chen said such a move could draw a backlash and protestsfrom the people of Taiwan and could hinder cross-straitrapprochement.
Mainland China is pushing Taiwan to decidethrough a referendum whether to ""separate from the mainland"" if itmakes the ""one country, two systems"" or ""one China"" principle a partof its proposed anti-secession law, Mainland Affairs Council ChairmanJoseph Wu said Tuesday.Speaking with a group of pro-Taiwan independence activists, Wusaid Taiwan will have no choice other than to ask its people todecide in a referendum whether to unite with the mainland onBeijing's terms of ""one country, two systems"" or whether to acceptthe ""one China"" principle if Beijing enshrines either of them in itsproposed law.He warned Beijing that the enactment of the so-called""anti-secession law"" is a provocation and an attempt to change thestatus quo across the Taiwan Strait, which Taiwan will not tolerate.The pro-independence activists called on the government torespond strongly to Beijing's proposal to enact an anti-secession lawdesigned to frighten Taiwan into giving up moves toward independence.
The United States hopes mainland China willput off its plan to enact an ""anti-secession law"" to help temper thetension across the Taiwan Strait, an American Institute in Taiwan(AIT) official said Tuesday.Raymond F. Greene, chief of the political section at the AIT'sTaipei office, made the remarks during a visit to the legislativecaucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), according toLai Ching-teh, one of the caucus leaders.Greene expressed concern about the DPP's attitude toward the""anti-secession law"" and whether it will promote a law to counteractit, Lai said.He also expressed worry that cross-strait tension will escalateas a result of the enactment of the law and any move by Taiwan toretaliate, Lai said.Lai told Greene that the DPP has repeatedly displayed goodwill toBeijing to try to improve cross-strait relations but it has to showits resolve to defend Taiwan's sovereignty in the face of themainland's plan to introduce the ""anti-secession law.""While the DPP and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, willorganize a demonstration for this purpose Feb. 28, they are likely tocooperate to propose a piece of counteracting legislation after the""anti-secession law"" is passed, Lai said.Asked whether the ""anti-secession law"" is the reason behind theUnited States' and Japan's recent decision to list ""encouraging thepeaceful resolution of issues concerning the Taiwan Strait throughdialogue"" part of their common strategic objectives in the region,Greene said Washington has a long-standing concern over peace in theAsia-Pacific region and that this concern will not change because ofthe ""anti-secession law,"" according to Lai.Also during the visit, Greene expressed the hope that theLegislative Yuan will pass the budget for a NT$610.8 billion(US$18.23 billion) arms procurement package from the United Stateswithin this session.
The Legislative Yuan will pass a resolutionagainst Beijing's anti-secession legislation, Legislative YuanSpeaker Wang Jin-pyng said Thursday.Wang made the announcement after a cross-party consultativemeeting to discuss certain critical legislative bills.During the meeting, Wang said, legislative whips of ruling andopposition parties reached a consensus on adopting a resolution tovoice opposition to Beijing's so-called anti-secession law targetingTaiwan.
The proposed anti-secession law, which will be deliberated by China's top legislature, the NationalPeople's Congress (NPC), at its upcoming annual full session, is by no means a so-called ""law on the use of force against Taiwan"", nor a so-called ""war mobilization order"", a spokesman for the NPC session said here Friday.
China's enactment of the Anti-Secession Law, as part of the overarching principle, is to closelyfocus on the theme of opposing and checking the secessionist activities of the ""Taiwan independence"" forces and promoting China's peaceful reunification, a senior Chinese lawmaker said here Tuesday.
","In early 2005, a Taiwanese official said Beijing's plan to pass an anti-secession law was aimed at legalizing a mainland invasion of his country. It would undermine stabililty across the Taiwan Strait, according to Taiwan's President Chen. Taiwan sent six delegations to the U.S., Japan and EU countries the year before to brief officials on the adverse impact on cross-strait relations the law would have. Beijing said in March, that ""one country, two systems"" was its basic approach to Taiwan, outlining, for the first time, its anti-secession law that was being considered by the National People's Congress. ","Planned consideration of an Anti-secession Law (ASL) by China's National People's Congress (NPC) stirred strong reactions in Taiwan. Taiwanese see the bill as establishing a legal justification for a military invasion of Taiwan. Furthermore, the ASC would diminish cross-Taiwan strait travel and restrict free expression of ideas, hindering cross-strait rapprochement. Taiwan claimed the support of the United States and European Union in opposing the measure. On March 8, 2005 as the NPC began deliberations on the bill, spokesmen defended the ASL as a means of promoting China's peaceful reunification on the basis of ""one country, two systems."" ","The PRC claims the anti-secession law to be deliberated by its legislative body in March is aimed at promoting a peaceful reunification with Taiwan. It denies that it would be used to justify military action. The PRC maintains that the one country, two systems approach is best for Taiwan. Taiwan fears the anti-secession law is designed to legalize a Beijing military invasion. It says it is a provocation that would undermine stability across the Taiwan Strait. Its ruling and opposition parties agreed to adopt a resolution against the Beijing law. The US and EU support Taiwan's position. ","Taiwan considers the PRC's plan to enact an anti-secession law a provocative move to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait. Emphasizing that Taiwan is not a part of the PRC as Beijing claims, Taiwan believes the legislation is aimed at establishing a legal justification for Beijing's invasion of the island. The U.S. and E.U.consider the legislation counterproductive to peace. The PRC claims that the law is designed to check the secessionist activities of ""Taiwan independence"" forces and promote China's reunification. The PRC legislature is scheduled to take up the anti-secession law in March. "
D0942,D0942-B,"The White House on Monday branded ""unfortuante"" China's adoption of a law giving its military the legal basis to attack Taiwan if the island moves towards independence.""We view the adoption of the anti-secession law as unfortunate. It does not serve the purpose of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,"" spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters.
Taiwan share prices closed sharply lower Tuesday, falling 1.50 percent on concerns over the outlook for cross-strait relations after China adopted an anti-secession law targeting the island, dealers said. The electronics majors, including semiconductor and flat-panel makers, led the decline as sentiment took a further hit after a moderate sell-off by foreign investors yesterday. The weighted index closed down 92.03 points at 6,063.48, off a high of 6,169.52 and a low of 6,028.17, on turnover of 85.38 billion Taiwan dollars (2.77 billion US). 
Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian condemned China Wednesday for ""heightening regional tensions"" by passing an anti-secession law this week, in his first comments since the legislation came into force.""Chinese communists have enacted a law of aggression which unilaterally altered the cross-strait status quo, heightening regional tensions and triggering disturbances in the world community,"" Chen said.
US lawmakers expressed ""grave concern"" Wednesday over a Chinese law giving legal backing for an invasion of Taiwan if the country moves toward formal independence.The US House of Representatives voted 424-4 in favor of a resolution warning that the anti-secession legislation alters ""the status quo in the region, and thus is of grave concern to the United States.""The resolution urges President George W. Bush to direct US officials to express to their Chinese counterparts ""the grave concern with which the United States views the passage of China's anti-secession law in particular, and the growing Chinese military threats to Taiwan in general.""""The Government of the United States should reaffirm its policy that the future of Taiwan should be resolved by peaceful means and with the consent of the people of Taiwan,"" it said, adding that the US government should continue to encourage dialogue between Taiwan and China.China's National People's Congress passed the law on Monday.
The legislative caucus of the rulingDemocratic Progressive Party (DPP) condemned Beijing Monday forpassing the Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan, saying the law iscausing irreparable damage to the development of cross-straitrelations.In a written statement, the DPP caucus condemned the move asseverely infringing upon the freedom, dignity and security of theTaiwan people, and urged the Taiwan people to spare no efforts indenouncing it.The statement said that the Republic of China is an independentsovereign state belonging to the 23 million people of Taiwan. Anymove to change Taiwan's status quo, if not agreed upon by the Taiwanpeople through a democratic referendum, is unacceptable, it added.The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China are twoseparate political entities, it said, adding that the fact that theROC government exercises exclusive sovereignty in the Taiwan areashould be respected by the PRC and the international community aswell.The DPP caucus called for the international community to denounceBeijing's Anti-Secession Law, saying that the law authorizes""non-peaceful means"" against Taiwan and is poised to escalatecross-strait tension and undermine stability in the Asia-Pacificregion.The law also goes against the U.N.

D0943,D0943-A,"Lawyers were set to begin crucial final arguments Tuesday in the caseof two Sikh immigrants from India accused of the 1985 mid-air bombingof an Air India plane which left 329 people dead.Closing arguments were expected to start with the defence ofRipudaman Singh Malik, a millionaire businessman in Vancouver.Lawyers for rural mill worker Ajaib Singh Bagri then were to presenttheir defence, followed by the prosecution team.The men, Sikhs who immigrated to Canada from India's northern stateof Punjab, are each charged with eight counts of murder andconspiracy in what was the world's worst airborne terrorist actbefore September 11, 2001.On June 23, 1985, a suitcase exploded at Japan's Narita airport,killing two baggage handlers as they transferred it to Air IndiaFlight 301 for Bangkok and Delhi.Less than an hour later, off the coast of Ireland, a second bombripped through Air India Flight 182 as it flew to London fromMontreal. All 329 people on board died.Though separated by long years and thousands of miles, both the 2001hijackings of four US jets, two of which crashed into New York'sWorld Trade Center, and the 1985 Air India bombings, were allegedlycarried out by fundamentalists bent on revenge against a foreigngovernment.Prosecutors contend Malik and Bagri, with others, planted bombs onAir India jets to punish the Indian government for its 1983 armyattack on Sikhdom's most holy place, the Golden Temple at Amritsar.At the time, Sikh separatists were fighting for an independenthomeland in India's Punjab.By the time Justice Ian Bruce Josephson of the British ColumbiaSupreme Court renders a decision on Malik and Bagri, the Air Indiacase will be nearly 20 years old.The verdict is unlikely to be the final chapter in the bombings case,however, because police continue to investigate other suspects.Since the trial began in April 2003, Canadian prosecutors haveconstructed a complex case against the pair, based on witnesstestimony, police interviews, phone records and surveillance.The trial is being held in a 7.5 million Canadian dollar (5.6 millionUS) bunker-like, bomb-proof, bullet-resistant court built especiallyfor this case.The court also designated as a remote annex a vast warehouse in asecret location. Within it is a skeleton of a Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet,named the Kanishka by Air India.Parts of the plane were hauled from the bed of the Atlantic Ocean,shipped to Canada and reconstructed by police.Prosecutors say Sikh extremists in Canada built two suitcase bombs,bought airline tickets and checked the suitcase bombs onto Vancouverflights connecting with Air India.A third man, Inderjit Singh Reyat, has been sentenced to 10 years inprison for a conviction in the Narita explosion, and was also chargedwith Bagri and Malik.In 2003, Reyat pleaded guilty to manslaughter for supplying bombmaterials and received a five-year sentence.Both prosecution cases hinge partly on women who were allegedly closeto Malik and Bagri.The first woman to testify once worked for Malik and says the pairwere in love. She told the court Malik once confided to her, ""We hadAir India crash."" Malik's lawyers are expected to reiterate argumentsthat the woman's testimony is not credible.The second woman alleged that Bagri asked to borrow her car about thetime the suitcase bombs were delivered to the airport.The identity of both women, as with many other witnesses in the case,is shielded under a publication ban. Two potential witnesses in thecase, both Sikh journalists, were assassinated. Other witnessesallege they have received threats.
Canadian prosecutors began wrapping up their final arguements hereMonday in the trial of two Sikh immigrants from India charged withconspiring to bomb Air India passenger jets in 1985, resulting in thedeaths of 331 people.The two Sikh immigrants, Ajaib Singh Bagri and Ripudaman Singh Malik,are each charged with eight counts of murder and conspiracy in thebombing, the deadliest single terrorist act until the September 11,2001 attacks in the United States.Prosecutors have argued that Bagri and Malik were among a group oforthodox Sikh immigrants to Canada who, in the turbulent 1980s, wageda campaign against India for its crackdown on religious Sikhs.Bagri's lawyer says his client was the innocent victim in the case.Prosecutor Robin Wright said his team will drive home an arguementthat the pair were part of a plot to check two suitcase bombs ontoAir India aircraft departing Vancouver.He said proof of their guilt ranges from providing financialassistance to a man convicted in the case, attempting to interferewith police investigations and admissions to people they trusted.Two bombs blew up on June 23, 1985, with the first killing twobaggage handlers at Japan's Narita airport as they transferredbaggage to an Air India plane. The second bomb killed 329 passengersaboard Air India Flight 182 off the Irish Coast.""There is no doubt these people were murdered,"" said Wright, addingthat the only explanation for the bombing was ""political andreligious zealotry.""The case against Bagri and Malik relies on key witnesses who say theaccused confessed details of their involvement, circumstantialevidence, and motives.Prosecutors say both men were part of a group of extremist Sikhs benton avenging India's attack on the Sikh Golden Temple at Amritsar in1984.The prosecution team will spend the next three weeks finalizing theircase before Justice Ian Bruce Josephson.Josephson is hearing the complicated trial alone without a jury.Earlier this month, defence teams for both accused wrapped up theirclosing arguments.The judge is expected to reserve his ruling in the case, possibly forseveral months.
Two men charged with murder and conspiracy in the Air India bombings,the world's most lethal terror strike prior to September 11, 2001,will wait until March to hear a verdict, a judge said Friday.After 19 months of complex hearings, the massive trial of Ajaib SinghBagri and Ripudaman Singh Malik ended Friday with lawyers on allsides trying to score a few last points.Justice Ian Bruce Josephson, who heard the case without a jury inthis western Canadian city, said he will reveal his decision March16.Bagri and Malik, who were arrested in 2000, are each charged witheight counts related to two bombings on June 23, 1985.On that day a suitcase bomb exploded at Japan's Narita airport,killing two Japanese baggage handlers as they transferred it to anAir India jet.Less than an hour later, Air India Flight 182 exploded off the Irishcoast, killing all 329 aboard.John Ward of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police told reporters that250 officers have worked on the case since 1985. The investigationinto more suspects continues, he said.""We still have 12 RCMP officers working on this case. We're not doneyet.""Prosecution spokesperson Geoffrey Gaul said 113 witnesses testifiedfor the government and for Bagri and Malik's defence teams.The trial was held behind bullet-resistant glass in aspecially-built, secure, 7.5-million-dollar (6.3 million US)underground courtroom.Bagri, a Sikh preacher and rural millworker, and Malik, a millionaireVancouver businessman, maintained their innocence.The pair is accused of taking part in a plot by Sikh fundamentaliststo build two bombs and plant them on two flights leaving Vancouverthat connected with Air India flights to London and Delhi.Government prosecutors contend that Malik arranged and paid for theairline tickets used to check the suitcase bombs onto planes, andthat Bagri arranged to get the bombs to the airport.The motive in targetting the Indian planes, said Gaul, was to fightfor the cause of an independent Sikh homeland, to be calledKhalistan, and avenge India's 1984 attack on the Sikh Golden Templeat Amritsar.The alleged mastermind of the plot, Talwinder Singh Parmar, waskilled in a police shootout in India in 1992.Nearly 20 years will have elapsed by the time Josephson rules on theguilt of the two men, who emigrated to Canada from Punjab.A third man in Canada, Inderjit Singh Reyat, pled guilty in 2003 tomanslaughter for his role in providing material for the bomb onFlight 182, and was sentenced to five years.The Air India bombing stood as the worst terror attack in modernhistory, until it was overtaken by the carnage of the attacks on theWorld Trade Center and the Pentagon in the United States in 2001.
Nearly 20 years after their loved ones died in the worst terrorstrike prior to the September 11 attacks, relatives of 329 peoplekilled in an Air India jet bombing are at last in sight of justice.Two orthodox Sikhs will learn in March whether they will be foundguilty of the 1985 outrage. Their trial ended Friday after sappingmillions of dollars from Canadian coffers.Justice Ian Bruce Josephson, who heard the case without a jury, willrule on March 16.That will be nearly two decades after suitcase bombs, which allegedlyoriginated in western Canada, killed two baggage handlers in Japanand 329 passengers on Air India Flight 182 off the Irish coast.Even before the verdict is pronounced, relatives of the 331 victimsare calling for a public inquiry.Earlier calls for an official probe were stymied by the criminalinvestigation, and eventual trial of Ajaib Singh Bagri and RipudamanSingh Malik. The two accused, immigrants from Punjab, were eachcharged with eight charges of murder and conspiracy.The massive case was the largest and most complex in Canadianhistory, with 18 months of pre-trial hearings, numerous related courthearings and a 19-month trial involving 113 witnesses and millions ofdocuments.The trial itself took place behind bullet-resistant glass in aspecially-built underground bunker of a courtroom in this west coastcity.Prosecutors said Bagri and Malik were religious Sikh fundamentalistswho used violence to achieve their political goals.Their motive in the bombings, said prosecution spokesman GeoffreyGaul, was to avenge India's 1984 attack on the Golden Temple inAmritsar, and fight for an independent Sikh homeland to be calledKhalistan.Prosecutors say two suitcase bombs were checked onto planes leavingVancouver, connecting with Air India flights to London and Bangkokand New Delhi.On June 23, 1985, the first bomb killed two baggage handlers atJapan's Narita airport, as they transferred it to Air India Flight201. The second exploded 54 minutes later aboard Air India Flight182, killing all 329 aboard.Defence lawyers maintain their clients are innocent and prosecutionwitnesses were either lying or delusional.""The witnesses weren't credible,"" said Malik's lawyer David Crossin.""Their case collapsed.""So far, only Inderjit Singh Reyat, an immigrant to Canada, has beenpunished for the 1985 terrorism. He was convicted in 1991 forproviding materials for the bomb at Tokyo's Narita airport.In 2003, he also pled guilty to manslaughter in the Flight 182bombing. He is serving two sentences totalling 15 years. The allegedmastermind of the plot, Tarwinder Singh Parma, died in a 1992 policeshootout in India.With the trial of Bagri and Malik now over, it's past time for aninquiry into the bombings, said Perviz Madon, whose husband Sam, acollege professor, died aboard Air India on June 23, 1985.""I am so tired, but we need the answers,"" said Madon.Relatives believe that if the details of the Air India bombings hademerged immediately, global airline practices would have changedbefore the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie,Scotland, in which 270 people died.In both disasters, critics blamed lax airport and airline security.A public inquiry would also investigate how police and intelligenceagents handled the Air India case, which was plagued by infightingbetween agencies and the erasure of evidence.Meanwhile, two potential witnesses were assassinated even beforecharges were laid. Fear of intimidation in Canada's immigrant Sikhcommunity has led to police protection for several prosecutionwitnesses.Some observers believe that even though the trial is over, moredetails of the case are lurking unseen.""There are more people involved than the two people who are charged,""said Dave Hayer, an British Columbia provincial legislator.Hayers father, Tara Singh Hayer, publisher of a local Sikh newspaper,was assassinated in 1998 before he could give evidence involvingBagri. No one has been charged with the murder.""Many people are not willing to talk, theyre still afraid,"" Hayersaid.
The trial of two men accused of bombing an Air India jumbo jet andkilling 329 people almost 20 years ago entered its final stretchTuesday with the defense attacking the credibility of a stargovernment witness.Vancouver millionaire Ripudaman Singh Malik, 57, and Kamloops,British Columbia mill worker Ajaib Singh Bagri, 55, are charged withmultiple counts of conspiracy and first degree murder in the world'sworst airline terrorism act prior to the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks onthe United States.Air India flight 182, a Boeing 747 on its way from Toronto to Indiavia London, blew up off the Irish coast on June 23, 1985, killing allaboard.Malik and Bagri, who have been in custody since their arrest in late2000, are also charged in connection with a blast on the same daythat killed two baggage handlers at Tokyo's Narita Airport.The case in British Columbia Supreme Court has stretched for 13months since hearings began in April 2003. More than 32 lawyers areworking on the case, which is believed to have cost more than US$80million (euro64 million).Perviz Madon lost her husband, Sam, on flight 182. She wants to seethe trial over by the end of the year.""It's time we had a closure,"" she said. ""It's been 20 years, forGod's sake. We're tired.""Final arguments are expected to last into December. The case is beingheard in a US$5 million (euro4 million) courtroom specifically builtfor security precautions.The defense argument hinges on attacking the credibility of a starwitness for the government, and asserting that at least one of thedefendants lacked a motive.Defense lawyer David Crossin argued Tuesday that the witness had anulterior motive to testify against Malik because she is a formerdisgruntled employee of his. The woman is in a government witnessprotection program and a court order bars the publication of hername.The woman, who testified that she had a close personal relationshipwith Malik, wrote in her diary that he had said: ""We had Air Indiacrash. Nobody, nobody can do anything.""Crossin said the prosecution's case ""stands or falls on the evidenceof this woman.""""We suggest the nature of that false evidence is profound,"" he said.Another prosecution witness, a man who was a member of a Sikhmilitant group in New York, testified that Bagri as much as confessedto him outside a New Jersey gas station.""We did this,"" the man, whom the Canadian government paid US$365,000(euro293,000) to testify, said Bagri told him. His identity is alsoprotected by the court.Prosecutors believe Malik and Bagri were part of a conspiracy byBritish Columbia-based Sikh extremists to take revenge against theIndian government, which owns Air India planes, for attacking a Sikhtemple in 1984.But the defense argued Tuesday there is no evidence Malik was at allinterested in Indian politics. Defense lawyers also contended that hehad substantial dealings with the state bank of India, which militantSikhs would have boycotted.""In our view, it is inconceivable that anyone would have participatedin this crime without a political motive,"" Crossin said.Bagri's political motivation appears more concrete. A month after thetemple raid, thousands of Sikhs gathered at Madison Square Garden inNew York City where Bagri reportedly told The World SikhOrganization: ""Until we kill 50,000 Hindus we will not rest.""He proposed the creation of a Sikh homeland called Khalistan and""spoke of the need for Sikhs to wage a war of independence to exactrevenge against the Indian government,"" according to documentsreleased by the court.Bagri has also been accused of inciting people at Sikh temples inBritish Columbia and Ontario, and for calling for the death of thenIndian prime minister Indira Gandhi. She was assassinated in 1984.Much of the case, however, hinges on the position of the bomb onFlight 182, which originated in Vancouver. Prosecutors have arguedthe bomb was in luggage originating in Vancouver. But Bagri's lawyerscontend the luggage containing the bomb joined the flight in Toronto.If Judge Ian Josephson accepts that defense, Bagri may be acquitted.Prosecutors maintain that Talwinder Singh Parmar, founder of themilitant Babbar Khalsa Sikh militant group, was the mastermind behindthe bombings. He died in a shootout with Indian police in 1992.Mysterious deaths have dogged the case from the start. Tara SinghHayer, a Vancouver-area Sikh newspaper publisher and outspoken criticof Sikh extremism, was crippled after being shot in 1988. He waskilled in November 1998 after another shooting.In 1995, Bagri also allegedly confessed his involvement to TarsemSingh Purewal, publisher of Britain's biggest Punjabi weeklynewspaper. Purewal, who was murdered in 1995, had been friends withHayer.___On the Net:Air India Trial: http//www.airindiatrial.ca
The prosecution began final arguments Monday in the case of an AirIndia jumbo jet bombing that killing 329 people almost 20 years ago,saying the two men accused in the Canadian trial were guilty beyond areasonable doubt.Vancouver millionaire Ripudaman Singh Malik, 57, and Kamloops,British Columbia mill worker Ajaib Singh Bagri, 55, are charged withmultiple counts of conspiracy and first-degree murder in the world'sworst airline terrorism act prior to the September 11, 2001, attackson the United States.Air India flight 182, a Boeing 747 named The Emperor Kanishka for theIndian ruler at the time of Christ, blew up off the Irish coast onJune 23, 1985, killing all aboard. The plane was traveling fromToronto to India via London.Malik and Bagri, who have been in custody since their arrest in late2000, are also charged in connection with a blast on the same Juneday that killed two baggage handlers at Tokyo's Narita Airport.More than 32 lawyers are working on the case believed to have costmore than US$80 million (euro64 million) since hearings began inApril 2003. It is being heard in a US$5 million (euro3.9 million)British Columbia Supreme Court room specifically built for securityprecautions.Prosecutors believe Malik and Bagri were part of a conspiracy byBritish Columbia-based Sikh extremists to take revenge against theIndian government, which owns Air India planes, for attacking a Sikhtemple in 1984.Prosecution lawyer Robert Wright on Monday opened final argumentsexpected to last two weeks, saying the guilt of Bagri and Malik ""hasbeen proven beyond a reasonable doubt.""""This is, in our submission, a politically motivated and terroristevent ... consistent only with a political and religious zealotry,""Wright said.The prosecution has noted that Bagri reportedly told The World SikhOrganization in 1984 at Madison Square Garden in New York City:""Until we kill 50,000 Hindus we will not rest.""He proposed the creation of a Sikh homeland called Khalistan and""spoke of the need for Sikhs to wage a war of independence to exactrevenge against the Indian government"", according to documentsreleased by the court.Bagri has also been accused of inciting people at Sikh temples inBritish Columbia and Ontario, and for calling for the death of thenIndian prime minister Indira Gandhi. She was assassinated in 1984.""Who would do something so terrible to kill so many innocent people?There is no doubt these people were murdered,"" Wright said.The prosecution's case is largely based on the testimony of threewitnesses who said the defendants had confessed the crimes to them.""These admissions are the ultimate piece of evidence against theaccused,"" Wright said.The defense has attacked the credibility of these witnesses andasserted that Malik lacked a motive because he was not interested inIndian politics.Defense lawyer David Crossin argued two weeks ago that one witnesswas a former disgruntled employee, another was paid $US365,000(euro285,000) by the government to testify and the third deniedevidence on the stand she had given to investigators years ago.Much of the case, however, hinges on the position of the bomb onflight 182, which originated in Vancouver. Prosecutors have arguedthe bomb was in luggage originating in Vancouver. But Bagri's lawyerscontend the luggage containing the bomb joined the flight in Toronto.""There was a murder plot in which two planes were supposed to explodesimultaneously. The two bombs originated here in the city ofVancouver,"" Wright said.He said Malik booked and paid for the tickets while Bagri arrangedfor bags containing the bombs to be delivered to the airport.Expert prosecution witnesses who testified also worked on theinvestigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 which blew upover Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, killing 270 people.At a secret Vancouver warehouse, salvaged parts of the plane havebeen reassembled with other parts fabricated using film footage ofpieces still on the ocean floor.
One of two men accused in the 1985 Air India bombings that claimed331 lives was driven by ambition and revenge, a prosecutor told aCanadian court in his closing arguments Monday.Vancouver millionaire Ripudaman Singh Malik, 57, and Kamloops,British Columbia, mill worker Ajaib Singh Bagri, 55, are charged withmultiple counts of conspiracy and first degree murder in the world'sworst airline terrorism act prior to the September 11, 2001, attackson the United States.Air India Flight 182, a Boeing 747 on its way from Toronto to Indiavia London, blew up off the Irish coast on June 23, 1985, killing allaboard. A second bomb exploded at Tokyo's Narita Airport, killing twobaggage handlers.""It has been shown (Malik) has a powerful and pervasive motive,""prosecutor Joe Bellows said in British Columbia Supreme Court.He told Judge Ian Josephson that the Indian government's 1984 attackon the Golden Temple in Amritsar, Sikhism's holiest shrine, was apivotal event in Malik's desire for revenge. Hundreds died in theattack.""All Sikhs . . . felt a terrible sacrilege had been committed againsttheir religion,"" Bellows said. ""They ignited in Malik emotions ofboth ambition and revenge,"" he said. ""Malik and his co-conspiratorschose to destroy not one but two Air India planes. The message to beconveyed was: If we can do this, we can do anything.""Bellows said the 1984 assassination of Indian Prime Minister IndiraGandhi by her Sikh bodyguards was also part of the reaction to thetemple raid.As Bellows spoke, Malik, dressed in traditional Sikh garb, dozed inthe prisoners' box protected by bulletproof glass.Bellows said Malik's praise for convicted bomb-maker Inderjit SinghReyat and his financial support for Reyat's family while in prison isfurther proof of his involvement in the plot.Bellows said Malik wanted to teach the Indian government a lesson asSikhs fought for the creation of an independent Sikh homeland,Khalistan, in India's Punjab state.Bellows recounted the testimony of one man who said Malik hadapproached him to carry an attache case containing a time bomb toVancouver's airport.""If a child dies for Sikhism, so what?"" Bellows recalled, quotingfrom the witness' testimony of what Malik told him. ""To Malik, thedeath of a child means nothing, the death of 329 people meansnothing. What matters is Khalistan.""The witness, whose name is protected by a court ordered publicationban, said Malik had been asked to approach him for the task byTalwinder Singh Parmar, the suspected mastermind behind the plot anda leader of the extremist Babbar Khalsa Sikh separatist group. Parmardied in a shootout with Indian police in 1992.Bellows showed the court a Canadian intelligence photograph of Malikoutside Parmar's home five days before the bombings.The defense has tried to discredit Malik's alleged confession of hisinvolvement in the bombings to an intimate female friend whose nameis also protected by the court. She was a disgruntled former employeemotivated by revenge, defense lawyers argued.Bellows, however, said the Crown witness was highly credible and thatthe case against Malik ""is proven on her evidence alone.""The woman, who testified that she had a close personal relationshipwith Malik, wrote in her diary that he had said: ""We had Air Indiacrash. Nobody, nobody can do anything.""Malik and Bagri, who have been in custody since their arrest in late2000, are also charged with the Narita blast.Bellows was expected to continue his closing arguments on Tuesday,and the case is likely to go to the judge for a verdict inmid-December.The defense concluded its case last month. Malik's legal team saidtheir client is innocent and accused the witnesses against him ofbeing motivated by a desire for revenge.The case has stretched for 13 months since hearings began in April2003. More than 32 lawyers are working on the case, which is believedto have cost more than $US80 million (euro62 million).
Two fiery speeches delivered to Sikh groups in the early 1980s showAjaib Singh Bagri had a motive to plant bombs on Air India jetskilling 331 people, a prosecutor said in closing arguments Monday.Bagri, a 55-year-old mill worker in Kamloops, British Columbia, andVancouver millionaire Ripudaman Singh Malik, 57, are charged withmultiple counts of conspiracy and first degree murder in the world'sworst airline terrorism act before the September 11, 2001, attacks inthe United States.Air India Flight 182, a Boeing 747 on its way from Toronto to Indiavia London, blew up off the Irish coast on June 23, 1985, killing allaboard. A second bomb exploded at Tokyo's Narita Airport, killing twobaggage handlers.Prosecutor Richard Cairns argued that Bargris was a high-rankingmember of a terrorist group. ""Revenge, revenge, revenge. That's whathe wants.""Cairns said Bagri gave two speeches calling for retribution for the1984 raids on India's Golden Temple, Sikhisms holiest shrine. Cairnsalso said Bagri made pointed references to Air India, saying theIndian government used proceeds from the airline to purchase weaponsto use against Sikhs.""Bagri is exhorting the crowd to take revenge on the Indiangovernment and Hindus,"" Cairns said. He said that in the speech,Bagri ""identifies his targets and he advocates revenge.""The defense has argued that Bagri's speeches amount only to fieryoratory, and has questioned the credibility of witnesses in the case,including that the star witness against Bagri, who was paid totestify by Canadian authorities.That witness, a member of a militant Sikh group whose identity isprotected by the court, said Bagri told him that he was responsiblefor the bombings. Bagri allegedly made the comment following a speechhe gave at New York's Madison Square Gardens.""'We have stuff that can blow like, like a (city) block,"" Cairnssaid, repeating the witnesses' testimony of what Bagri told him.The witness, who is not charged with a crime, was paid US$386,000(euro298,000) to testify. Cairns also noted that another protectedwitness testified that Bagri asked her if he could borrow her car totake some bags to Vancouver International Airport. The bags would begoing on the plane, he would not, the woman testified.A verdict in the trial which began in April 2003 isn't expected untilearly 2005.
Final arguments in the murder trial of two Sikhs charged with the1985 bombing of an Air India jumbo jet concluded, ending one of themost exhaustive and expensive trials in Canadian history.The trial against a millionaire and a mill worker charged withmultiple counts of conspiracy and first-degree murder hinges on thetestimony of three star witnesses and contradicting bombing experts.British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Ian Josephson announced Fridayhe will deliver a decision on March 16, 2005.The case has called 115 witnesses since it began in April 2003. Witha specially built courtroom, the trial cost more than US$100 million(euro75 million).Ripudaman Singh Malik, a 57-year-old millionaire, and Ajaib SinghBagri, 55, are charged with planting bombs that exploded June 23,1985, aboard Flight 182, killing 329 people, and 53 minutes earlierat Tokyo's Narita Airport, killing two baggage handlers.Alleged bombmaker Inderjit Singh Reyat has already pleaded guilty tomanslaughter and is in prison.Perviz Madon lost her husband, Sam, on Flight 182. She and her son,Eddie, have attended the trial regularly.""I think the waiting is going to be hard,"" she said of the case goingto the judge. ""Let's just hope the wait will be worth it.""The prosecution alleges the motive was revenge against the Indiangovernment's 1984 attack against separatists who had taken refuge inthe Golden Temple of Amritsar, Sikhism's holiest shrine.The attack also led to the 1984 assassination of Indian PrimeMinister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards.The prosecution said the accused were zealots driven by a desire tocreate an independent Sikh state of Khalistan in the Punjab region ofnorthern India and wanted to teach the Indian government a lesson.""All Sikhs ... felt a terrible sacrilege had been committed againsttheir religion,"" prosecutor Joe Bellows said during closingarguments.While the defense maintains there is no evidence Malik was interestedin Indian politics, Bagri's political motivation appeared moreconcrete.A month after the temple raid, thousands of Sikhs gathered at MadisonSquare Garden in New York City where Bagri reportedly told The WorldSikh Organization: ""Until we kill 50,000 Hindus we will not rest.""The prosecution has alleged Malik and Bagri were members of theBabbar Khalsa Sikh terrorist group led by Talwinder Singh Parmar, thealleged mastermind of the bombing.Parmar died in a shootout with Indian police in 1992.A prosecution witness who testified that she had a close personalrelationship with Malik, wrote in her diary that he had said: ""We hadAir India crash. Nobody, nobody can do anything.""The defense has tried to discredit the testimony, saying she was adisgruntled former employee motivated by revenge.The judge must also decide between the conflicting testimony of twobombing experts who testified earlier this year.Bagri's lawyer, Richard Peck, said Friday: ""This case has been a trekacross a vast expanse of knowledge, experience, and law.""The defense lawyer for Malik, David Crossin, called the case a""logistical nightmare"" and said, ""I don't think there will ever besuch a case like this again, in this country, or perhaps the world.""""It was a long haul, I'm glad it's over,"" Crossin said.Crown spokesman Geoffrey Gaul said the trial lasted 202 days totaland included 113 witnesses. In all, 178 family members attended, manycoming from around the world to view the trial, said Gaul.Mysterious deaths have dogged the case from the start. Tara SinghHayer, a Vancouver-area Sikh newspaper publisher and outspoken criticof Sikh extremism, was crippled after being shot in 1988. He waskilled later that year in another shooting.In 1995, Bagri allegedly confessed his involvement to Tarsem SinghPurewal, a publisher of Britain's biggest Punjabi weekly newspaperwho was murdered later that year.
Nearly 20 years after an Air India Boeing 747 from Canada exploded inthe air and plunged into waters off the Irish coast, killing all 329people on board, the trial to finally resolve what happened enteredits climactic phase this week.More than 100 witnesses have testified during nearly two years ofproceedings in the most serious terrorism trial in Canadian history.A special high-security courtroom was built for the case, at a costof $6 million, complete with a prisoner dock encased in bulletproofglass. Aging relatives of the victims came from as far away as SriLanka to watch from the court gallery.But as prosecutors began their final arguments Monday to convict twoCanadian Sikh activists accused of plotting the bombing, the outcomeof the trial is far from settled because of years of bungled policework and the unexplained killings of an important witness andsuspect.In addition, key witnesses offered vague and contradictoryrecollections, and key evidence is circumstantial. Both defendants --Ripudaman Singh Malik, a 57-year-old millionaire real estateentrepreneur, and Ajaib Singh Bagri, a 56-year-old sawmill worker andSikh preacher -- pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree murderand conspiracy in the bombing of the jet, Air India Flight 182 enroute from Toronto and Montreal to India, on June 23, 1985.The two are also charged with conspiring in an explosion that killedtwo baggage handlers at Narita airport outside Tokyo 54 minutesbefore Flight 182 went down. Prosecutors said both bombs were placedon Air India aircraft in Vancouver.(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)""This was a murder plot in which two planes were to explodesimultaneously,"" said Robert H. Wright, the chief prosecutor as hebegan to sum up his case. ""It is difficult to comprehend how thiswould happen. Who would do something so terrible?"" Answering his ownquestion, Wright told the court that only ""political and religiouszealotry"" could motivate such a crime.Prosecutors say Malik, who has worn a white tunic at the trial,recruited members of the plot and gave $3,000 to a friend to pick uptickets for the flight with the ultimate aim of planting the bomb onFlight 182. Bagri, who wears a dark turban, is accused of takingluggage with the explosives to the Vancouver airport.Neither Malik nor Bagri chose to testify.Prosecutors have alleged that Malik and Bagri were motivated torevenge the 1984 Indian army storming of the Golden Temple ofAmritsar after the holy shrine was taken over by militant Sikhs. Thatattack sparked a cascade of violence and revenge killings thatincluded the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)With no physical evidence or firsthand testimony linking the accusedto the bombing, the outcome of the trial is in doubt. The prosecutionwraps up its case in the next few weeks, and Justice Ian BruceJosephson is expected to reach a decision early next year.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)The prosecution has shown a video of Bagri giving an incendiaryspeech at a New York Sikh rally in July 1984 in which he said, ""Wewill not take rest until we kill 50,000 Hindus.""But most of the prosecution's case is based on supposed confessionsMalik and Bagri gave to several associates that they deny making.The government has highlighted statements made by a Canadian SecurityIntelligence Service agent that a friend of Bagri said he had visitedthe night before the bombing to ask to borrow her car to drop offsome bags at the airport. By court order, the woman, like other keywitnesses, cannot be identified. The agent testified that the womansaid that Bagri implied that wrongdoing would be done, but, duringthe trial, she said she did not remember making such statements.Josephson ruled that her prior testimony should be admitted asevidence after the prosecution argued that witnesses were comingunder pressure from Sikh activists.The key prosecution witness against Malik is a former employee at areligious school that Malik directed. She testified that he told herin 1996 and 1997, while they were involved in a strong personal, butplatonic relationship, that he helped organize the conspiracy anddetailed his role in arranging for the purchase and pickup of airlinetickets that were used to check in the baggage with the explosives.The witness said she distanced herself from him after the admissions,after which she was subjected to threats. She was eventually fired.Malik's lawyer questioned her credibility as a disgruntled employee.The prosecution has also been hampered by the fact that the suspectedmain ringleader of the plot, a former Canadian resident, TalwinderSingh Parmar, was killed by Indian authorities when they caught himclandestinely crossing from Pakistan in 1992.Tara Singh Hayer, the publisher of a Sikh newspaper in Vancouver,told police in 1995 that he had overheard Bagri admit to his role inthe attacks. But three years later, Hayer was gunned down outside hishome in a Vancouver suburb.Prosecutors were also held back by numerous errors made byinvestigators. The Canadian intelligence service withdrew an agentwho had infiltrated Sikh activist ranks only days before the attacksand erased hours of tape recordings of conversations by several ofthe prime suspects intercepted before the plane bombings. They latersaid they had not realized the significance of the tapes. Meanwhile,the Royal Canadian Mounted Police failed to follow up on crucialevidence for years, apparently because of internal politics.""We feel a deep sense of betrayal on the part of the Canadiangovernment,"" said Lata Pada, a 56-year-old choreographer from Torontowho lost her husband and two daughters on the flight. ""Canada hasstill not woken up to the reality that global terrorism is still inour back yard.""
","Two men accused of bombing an Air India jet, killing 329 people in 1985, were tried in Vancouver nearly 20 years later. Prosecutors charged that a millionaire named Malik and a millworker named Bagri were Sikhs taking revenge against the Indian government, which owned Air India planes, for attacking a Sikh temple in 1984. The prosecution's case rested upon their providing financial assistance to a man convicted in the case, attempting to interfere with investigations, and admissions to people they trusted. Defense lawyers attacked the credibility of witnesses. There were years of bungled police work and unexplained killings of witnesses. ","Two Sikhs, Ripudaman Malik and Ajaib Bagri, were charged with the 1985 bombing of an Air India jet that killed 329 passengers and with killing two baggage handlers at Narita Airport. Final arguments in their murder trial concluded in December 2004. Prosecutors believe the Sikhs' motive was to avenge India's 1984 attack on the Golden Temple in Amritsar. The trial was not settled due to years of bungled police work, unexpected killings of witnesses and a suspect, and vague and contradictory testimonies. Justice Ian Josephson, who heard the case without a jury, will deliver his decision in March 2005. ","Ripudaman Malik and Ajaib Bagri have been in custody over four years accused of bombing an Air India jumbo jet in June 1985 killing 329 people. Prosecutors believe the two British Columbia-based Sikh extremists acted in revenge against the Indian government for attacking a Sikh temple in 1984. The trial is being held in a bomb-proof court built especially for this trial, the largest and most complex in Canadian history. More than 100 witnesses have testified. Some key witnesses have offered vague and contradictory recollections. Two potential witnesses were assassinated and others received threats. Key evidence is circumstantial. ","Final arguments were presented in the British Columbian trial of two Indian Sikh immigrants accused of involvement in two bombings: an Air India jet which exploded off the Irish coast in 1985, killing all 329 aboard; and a bomb that killed two baggage handlers in Tokyo. The prosecution held that the men wanted revenge against the Indian government for attacking Sikhdom's most holy temple in 1984. The defense argued against the credibility of three key witnesses. There is no physical evidence or first-hand testimony linking the suspects to the bombings. The judge will deliver a decision on 16 March. "

Two Sikh men walked free after a judge Wednesday acquitted them of massacring 329 people in a 1985 Air India jet bombing, in the worst single airborne terror strike before September 11, 2001.Loved ones of victims gasped in shock, as the judge threw out eight counts of murder and conspiracy each against Ajaib Singh Bagri, 55, and Ripudaman Singh Malik, 58.The dramatic judgements followed a near two-year trial on prosecution claims that the two men planted the bomb, and another device which exploded on the ground in Tokyo, to punish India for its crackdown on Sikhs in the early 1980s.""Despite the horrific nature of the alleged crimes, there can be no lowering of the standard of proof from that required in any criminal trial,"" said Justice Ian Bruce Josephson in the British Columbia Supreme Court.The evidence had fallen ""markedly short"" of the standard required to convict the men, said Josephson, who heard the case in a specially constructed blast-resistant courtroom without a jury.Shellshocked prosecutors were left to ponder whether there was ground for appeal, and to defend their decision to bring the case to court.""It is premature to say at this stage what will transpire,"" said prosecution spokesman Geoffrey Gaul.But Josephson's verdict was so withering, and questioning of key witness testimony so acute, that the feasibility of an appeal was in question.Malik and Bagri, orthodox Sikhs who immigrated to Canada from Punjab, were accused of conspiring to plant suitcase bombs on two aircraft.Prosecutors claimed the two men worked with a Sikh group to build suitcase bombs on Vancouver Island, then planted the explosives on two flights from Vancouver that connected with Air India planes.One bomb exploded in the hold of Air India Flight 182 over the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Ireland on June 23, 1985. All 329 people aboard the jumbo jet died.Just 54 minutes earlier, another bomb had exploded at Japan's Narita airport, killing two baggage handlers transferring suitcases to Air India Flight 201.Bagri, a free man for the first time in four years, told reporters outside court that he had been accused of horrendous crimes.""I had absolutely no involvement in any of these criminal acts. The loss of so many innocent lives resulting from these events was an enormous tragedy.""But for relatives of those who perished on the Air India plane, there was only the agony of reopened wounds, 20 years on, and demands for the true culprits of the outrage to be brought to justice.""I can't believe it, I can't believe it,"" one man cried in court.Another man, Rattan Singh Kalsi, who lost his daughter in the tragedy on June 23, 1985, was crying along with his wife.""They should not have brought the case to court. We were suffering but now we are suffering more.""Rumi Shross, who lost a friend in the disaster, said he could not comprehend the verdict.""I have no words to describe it, how difficult it is,"" he told CBC television.""I lost a very dear friend 20 years ago, my mind is totally blank ... 329 innocent lives were lost.""Canada's Deputy Prime Minister Anne McLellan said it was too early to say whether a public inquiry was needed, despite calls from victims' families who argue the police and security services botched the case.Aside from the acquitted Bagri and Malik, a third man, Inderjit Singh Reyat was convicted in the Narita explosion and sentenced to 10 years, before he was charged with the bomb on Flight 182. In 2003, just before the trial was to begin, Reyat pleaded guilty to manslaughter, and is serving a five-year sentence.Another immigrant to Canada, Tarwinder Singh Parma, was the alleged mastermind of the plot and died in a 1992 police shootout in India.During the trial, prosecutors contended that Malik, a millionaire Vancouver businessman, and Bagri, a rural millworker, were part of a radical Sikh group based on Canada's west coast.Its mission was to punish India for its crackdown on Sikhs in the early 1980s and the army's attack on the Sikh Golden Temple at Amritsar, prosecutor Robert Wright told the court.
The verdict in the Air India bombing trial in Canada, is unfair but has come too late to matter, some relatives in India of victims of the 1985 bombing said Thursday.""It's been 20 years now and the world had forgotten the bombing,"" said Muktaben Bhat, 70-year-old mother of Bombay businessman and theatre actor Parag Bhat who was killed in the blast along with his wife Chand and six-month-old son Siddhant.""The verdict has come too late, but I am shocked as it is unfair,"" she told AFP.Bhat, who had attended some of the hearings of the trial in Vancouver in 2003, said she was convinced the two accused were guilty of the crime and the ""not guilty"" verdict had stunned her.Her daughter Manjiri was in the court when the verdict was delivered Wednesday.""There were small instances and a chain of events that linked the two accused to the crime. I am shocked and hurt as to how they can be let off,"" said Bhat.""The trial was conducted in a bullet-proof court room and so much money was spent on it by the Canadian government. We all knew that the two were guilty. Anyway what can we say as a lot of time has passed now.""Parag was Bhat's only son and his body was not found. ""My son, his wife and their son had gone for a vacation to Canada. They never came back. I have no one to succeed my family as Parag was the only son I had,"" said Bhat who lost her husband a few years ago after a long illness and now stays alone in suburban Bombay.The widow of S.S. Binder, co-pilot of the ill-fated Air India Flight 182, also felt the verdict had come too late.""Too much time has passed since the crash,"" Amarjit Bhinder told the Indian Express newspaper.Indian-born Ajaib Singh Bagri and Ripudaman Singh Malik saw charges against them dismissed after a judge in Vancouver ruled the prosecution in a near two-year trial had not proven its case against them beyond reasonable doubt.The pair were cleared of eight charges each of murder and conspiracy in the bombing of the plane and a blast less than an hour earlier in Tokyo which killed two baggage handlers.The June 23, 1985 attack in which 329 people died represented the world's worst aviation terror strike prior to September 11, 2001.Loud gasps rippled through the courtroom packed with about 70 relatives and friends of bombing victims as Justice Ian Bruce Josephson acquitted first Malik and then Bagri.Sobbing uncontrollably, one woman fled outside, while most of the other relatives sat dazed and broke into tears.They had waited nearly 20 years for the verdict, and many had travelled to the western Canadian city from India, the United States and throughout Canada hoping for convictions.
Venomous demands for justice besieged Canada's government Thursday, after two Sikhs were cleared of killing 329 people in a 1985 Air India jet bombing.Loved ones of victims, the press and foes of Prime Minister Paul Martin's government demanded to know why there were no murder convictions after a 20 year probe which cost 100 million dollars (82 million) Families of passengers who perished, in both Canada and India, proclaimed a ""mockery of justice"" and demanded a government investigation.Canada's newspapers Thursday reflected a wave of shock at the acquittals of two Sikh men Ajaib Singh Bagri and Ripadaman Singh at the British Columbia Supreme Court.Toronto-based Globe and Mail devoted its front page to the headline ""innocent"" and the names of the 329 victims, 135 of them children, plus two baggage handlers killed in Tokyo in a related attack.There were few critics of the judge, who found that the prosecution in the case, in Vancouver, the origin of two suitcase bombs, had failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the two men were guilty.""But Canadians can and should know what happened, how the investigation was handled, why it took so long to make arrests and whether Canada's police and intelligence communities have learned from it,"" the Toronto Star said in a hard-hitting editorial.Deputy Prime Minister Anne McLellan, said in the immediate aftermath of the verdict that she could ""not see any benefit"" to calling a public inquiry.But relatives who lost loved ones on Wednesday lined up in a press conference in Vancouver to blast the Canadian police system and secret services and the government.""The perpetrators of this crime are free men today, they have made a mockery of the Canadian justice system, said Eddie Maddon, whose father Sam died in the tragedy.""The Canadian justice system has made a mockery of all of us,"" said John Chatlani, whose mother, brother and sister died.Lata Pada, whose husband and two daughters died aboard the jumbo said the verdict ""flies in the face of what we believe Canada to be, a fair society  ... the government needs to be held accountable for this betrayal.""Relatives in victims in India also turned their fire on Canada.""If the two accused who were narrowed down after a lot of investigation are not the culprits, then who is it,"" asked Bollywood actor Vijayendra Ghatge whose sister Sangeeta died in the mid-air tragedy.""Initially after the verdict I was disappointed, but now we relatives of the victims feel that justice needs to be done and there should be further, deep investigation,"" Ghatge told AFP.
Ripudaman Singh Malik was found not guilty Wednesday in the deaths of 329 peoplewho perished when Air India Flight 182 was brought down by a bomb 20 years agoin Canada's worst case of mass murder.Justice Ian Josephson was still to pass judgment on Ajaib Singh Bagri, 55, whoalong with Malik had faced charges of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commitmurder and attempted murder in the downing of Flight 182.The two men were also charged in an explosion at Japan's Narita airport thatkilled two baggage handlers on the same day.About 100 people began lining up outside the B.C. Supreme Court building undertight security and in a steady rain trying to get seats to hear Justice IanJosephson's verdict.
After a two-year trial, a Canadian judge on Wednesday acquitted two Indian-bornSikhs of murder and other charges in the deaths of 331 people killed in thebombings of an Air India plane over the Atlantic and at Tokyo's airport 20 yearsago.British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Ian Josephson said the prosecution'switnesses were not credible.Josephson found Ripudaman Singh Malik, 58, and Ajaib Singh Bagri, 55, not guiltyon all eight charges each man faced, including first-degree murder andconspiracy to commit murder.On June 23, 1985, Air India Flight 182 from Montreal to London, carrying luggageand passengers originating in Vancouver, exploded and crashed into the AtlanticOcean off the coast of Ireland. All 329 people on board, mostly Canadians, werekilled.An hour earlier, a bomb in baggage intended for another Air India flightexploded in the Tokyo airport, killing two baggage handlers.Canadian prosecutors claimed that the two explosions were the result of oneconspiracy, an act of revenge by Sikh separatists for the 1984 raid by Indianforces on the Golden Temple at Amritsar, the holiest site in theirreligion.
A Canadian judge acquitted two Indian-born Sikhs of killing 331 people twodecades ago in the bombings of an Air India plane over the Atlantic and a Tokyoairport. The verdict ended a two-year trial in Canada's worst case of massmurder.British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Ian Josephson said Wednesday that theprosecution's key witnesses were not credible. The bombings were the deadliestterrorist strikes before the Sept. 11 attacks.""Words are incapable of adequately conveying the senseless horror of thesecrimes,"" said Josephson, who heard the case without a jury at the defendants'request. ""Hundreds of men, women and children were entirely innocent victims ofa diabolical act of terrorism.""Spectators in the courtroom, including dozens of victims' relatives, gasped whenthe verdicts were read. Some started wailing.""Why did they even have this trial?"" said Rattan Singh Kalsi, 75, of London,Ontario, whose daughter was aboard the Air India plane. ""We were sufferinganyway. Now we will suffer more.""The defendants _ Ripudaman Singh Malik, 58, and Ajaib Singh Bagri, 55 _ wereimmediately released. Malik smiled as he swept through a crowd of reporterssurrounded by police to a waiting car.""If these men are not guilty. Then who killed all those innocent travelers?""asked a sobbing Mukta Bhat, who lost son, daughter-in-law and 6-month-oldgrandson in the attack. ""Who will answer for all our years ofpain?""Like many others across India, Bhat, 73, of Bombay, stayed up past midnightIndian time to learn the verdict.Air India Flight 182 from Montreal to London, originating in Vancouver, explodedand crashed off Ireland on June 23, 1985. All 329 people on board, mostlyCanadians, were killed.An hour earlier, a bomb in baggage intended for another Air India flightexploded in the Narita airport, killing two baggage handlers.Speaking on behalf of the families, Susheel Gupta, who lost his mother on theflight, called on the Canadian government to conduct a public inquiry into thecase.""This was murder pure and simple,"" he said. ""Murder. Murder in any systemdemands justice."" ""Through no fault of their own in traveling to India and nofault of ours, our loved ones never came home.""Prosecutor Robert Wright maintained that the bombing was revenge by Sikhseparatists for a deadly 1984 raid by Indian forces on the Golden Temple atAmritsar, the holiest site in their religion.Bagri, a ""militant Sikh terrorist,"" gave a speech in New York that urged thekilling of Hindus in the drive for a separate Sikh state of Khalistan, Wrightsaid.In a July 21, 1984, speech at Madison Square Garden, Bagri said: ""Until we kill50,000 Hindus, we will not rest.""In their opening statements starting April 28, 2003, lawyers for Bagri and Maliksaid prosecutors had a weak case that hinged on the testimony of three starwitnesses and bomb experts.Josephson dismissed the credibility of prosecution witnesses, including a womanwho said Malik told her of a plan to smuggle two bombs on flights from Vancouverthat would be transferred to two Air India jets.Josephson said the testimony of the woman, who claimed she and Malik were inlove, was at the heart of the case against Malik.But on greater examination, he said: ""I find that she has not been truthful withthe court and that I am unable to rely on her.""The woman remains in a witness protection program.Josephson gave similar assessments about many of the other major prosecutionwitnesses. The star witness against Bagri had testified the accused told him,""We did this,"" when talking about the bombing outside a New Jersey gasstation.Josephson, however, said the man was motivated by self-interest.He was willing ""to engage in deception and lies, even under penalty of perjury,whenever he believed it would advance his self-interest,"" he said in dismissingthe evidence.Reporters were barred from identifying any of the witnesses.Investigators believe the Air India bombing was masterminded by Talwinder SinghParmar, leader of the extremist Babbar Khalsa group that advocates creating aSikh state called Khalistan in India's Punjab region. Parmar was killed byIndian police in 1992.Malik worked as a taxi driver after arriving in Canada from India in 1972 andbuilt up business holdings, becoming a driving force behind the Vancouver-areaKhalsa Credit Union with assets of more than US$1 million.Bagri arrived in Canada in 1968, according to court documents, and was a millworker.A third man in the case, alleged bomb-maker Inderjit Singh Reyat, pleaded guiltyFeb. 10 to one count of manslaughter and was sentenced to five years injail.After Reyat's guilty plea, Malik and Bagri chose a trial by judge. Reyatpreviously served a 10-year sentence for his 1991 conviction in the Tokyoairport bombing.A fourth man, former Vancouver Sikh Temple president Hardial Singh Johal, wasarrested but not charged in the case. He has since died.
A judge here acquitted two Canadian Sikhs onWednesday of engineering a plan to put bombs on Air India flights 20years ago, leaving unanswered who was responsible for Canada's worstmass killing and the largest act of air terrorism before Sept. 11,2001.Ending a four-year case, the judge found that the assortment offormer girlfriends, paid informers and fallen-out business partnerscentral to the prosecution were not credible enough to convict amillionaire Vancouver businessman and a Sikh activist of murder. Hisfinding shocked family members of the victims.``We are devastated that the true perpetrators of this crime arefree today,'' said Ed Madon, who was 8 when his father died aboard theAir India plane brought down in 1985 over the Atlantic Ocean. ``TheCanadian justice system has failed us.''The verdict was a blow to government efforts to counter allegationsthat imported political passions simmering within the country's manyimmigrant communities could be a source of terrorism. Prosecutorsasserted that angry Sikhs in British Columbia planted the bombs toretaliate against the Indian government's attack on a Sikh temple inPunjab in 1984.One bomb brought down an Air India Boeing 747, killing all 329aboard as it neared the coast of Ireland on June 23, 1985. The secondexploded luggage being transferred to an Air India flight at Tokyo'sairport, killing two baggage handlers. In both cases, the bags wereloaded onto flights out of Canada that connected to Air India flights.After years of what victims' families called official neglect,authorities belatedly mounted the most complex and costlyinvestigation in the country's history. But it failed to crack thesecrecy among the immigrant community. Provincial court Justice IanBruce Josephson upheld much of the government's theory of the crimesbut ruled that investigators had not proven beyond a reasonable doubtwho carried them out.``We are very disappointed today,'' said Sgt. John Ward of theRoyal Canadian Mounted Police. But he said, ``We are stillinvestigating this matter. We will not stop.''Family members said that because of the inconclusive verdict, apublic inquiry is now needed as to who carried out the terrorist actsand how the fledgling Canadian Security Intelligence Service failed topursue the case 20 years ago.``Only a public inquiry can investigate the failures of thesystem,'' said Susheel Gupta, who was 12 when his mother was killed.``This was murder, pure and simple. If the murder of 329 peopledoesn't deserve a public inquiry, what does?''Investigators had a prime suspect under surveillance before thebombings. But reports that came out 19 years later showed that theyoften lost track of the suspect, ended surveillance hours before thebombs were placed, and erased wiretapped conversations that could haveled to earlier arrests.``This sends the message that someone can come into Canada, setbombs on planes and kill people, and get away with it,'' said DaveHayer, a provincial legislator. His father, a Canadian Sikh journalistwho condemned the bombings, was assassinated in 1998, reportedly bySikh radicals.The bombings were a chilling harbinger of the terrorist attacks onthe World Trade Center and Pentagon. In Canada, they provoked similarsurprise that foreign conflicts could bring violence to distant,relatively secure countries, and similar postmortem findings thatinvestigators had missed warnings and clues before the attacks.``It should have been a wake-up call,'' said Reg Whitaker, apolitical scientist at the University of Victoria. The Air Indiabombings were among the first to feature the kinds of threats fromsmall, shadowy radical groups that now face the world, he said.``In the 1980s, the world was still in the Cold War. We were stilllooking for Russian networks,'' he said. ``Terrorism was notidentified as it is now, in terms of an attack on the homeland thatcould reach into the lives of everyday people.''The case against the two accused, a millionaire businessman namedRipudaman Singh Malik and a preacher and sawmill worker, Ajaib SinghBagri, took years to build. In part this was because of officialfumbling that the Toronto Globe and Mail newspaper later called``staggering.''The two men were associates of Talwinder Singh Parmar, a Sikh whoauthorities said led a militant group from his home in Burnaby, B.C.After India's raid on the Sikhs' holy Golden Temple, the CanadianSecurity Intelligence Service suspected that Parmar had been involvedin a plot to kill Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. They put Parmarunder surveillance but repeatedly lost him.``Anyone in the back seat of a car wearing a beard and turban lookslike the next guy,'' a CSIS agent said in a report that was madepublic last year. Agents tailed the wrong cars, and residents calledpolice to complain about not-so-secret spies loitering near Parmar'shouse. As agents argued with one neighbor, their suspect drove awayunnoticed.Family members said Wednesday that those lapses must now beinvestigated.``The Canadian justice system has mocked all of us,'' said JohnChatlani, whose mother died in the bombing over the Atlantic.``Someone needs to be held accountable.''Parmar, who Josephson said was the probable mastermind of the plot,returned to India and was killed in 1992 in what police there said wasa confrontation with authorities. The charges against Malik and Bagriwere largely based on comments they allegedly made in the years afterthe bombings.A third man, Inderjit Singh Reyat, was sentenced to 10 years in1991 for buying materials for the Tokyo bomb and five years in 2003for his role in the bombmaking that brought down Air India Flight 182off the coast of Ireland.Geoffrey Gaul, a prosecution spokesman, said government lawyerswould see whether there were grounds to appeal Josephson's ruling.
Twenty years after a bomb on anairliner en route from Toronto to New Delhi blew upoff the Irish coast, killing 329 people, a judge onWednesday acquitted the two Indian-born Canadian Sikhs charged in theexplosion.The unexpected end after 19 months of testimony trial leaves theworst case of mass murder in Canadian history and thebloodiest attack on civilian air aviation before Sept. 11, 2001,an unsettled mystery.The decision by a British Columbia Supreme Court judge that thegovernment had not made a conclusive case after two decadesof investigations costing more than $80 million represented a rebuketo the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canada's federal intelligenceagency.Nearly all the physical evidence was lost 7,000 feet below theocean. The most credible potential witnesses were either murdered, diedof natural causes, or were apparently intimidated from testifying orlied on the stand.The few important prosecution witnesses, who testified that they had heardthe defendants confess, were deemed unreliable and biased by JusticeIan Bruce Josephson.The judge declared that justice would not be achieved ""if personsare convicted on anything less than the requisite standard ofproof beyond a reasonable doubt.""Prosecutors left open the possibility of an appeal and the policesaid that they stood by their investigation but that thecase remained open. The only person convicted of any rolein the June 23, 1985, explosions has refused to cooperateand several other people suspected in the plot have neverbeen charged.The two defendants, Ripudaman Singh Malik and Ajaib Singh Bagri, wereproponents of a separate Sikh state, but they denied involvementin the bombings.All 329 people on board Air India Flight 182, most ofthem Canadian Hindus, died in the explosion. Eighty victims wereunder 12 years old. Another bomb, in luggage being transferredbetween other planes, exploded less than an hour earlier, killingtwo baggage handlers at Narita Airport in Tokyo. Josephson saidin his verdict that he was convinced both bombs originatedfrom flights that had left Vancouver.Prosecutors said the bombings were part of terrorist actions in retaliationfor the Indian army's 1984 storming of the Golden Templein Amritsar, Sikhism's holiest shrine in an effort to capturearmed Sikh separatists inside.The suspected mastermind in the bombings, Talwinder Singh Parmar, was killedin 1992 while in Indian police custody. Another suspect, HardialSingh Johal, was arrested but died of natural causes in2002.The only person punished for the crimes so far is InderjitSingh Reyat, who was convicted in 1991 of making theTokyo bomb who was convicted in 2003 for involvement inthe other bombing. His refusal to cooperate with prosecutors wasa setback for them.The trial had a Rip Van Winkle feel to it. Overthe past two years, 115 witnesses described scenes and eventsthat tested their memories and recalled a time when airlinesecurity was remarkably lax.
A Canadian judge announced Wednesday that Sikh businessman Ripudaman Singh Malik and sawmill worker Ajaib Singh Bagri were not guilty of conspiracy and murder in the 1985 Air India bombing that killed 329 people.Justice Ian Bruce Josephson of the British Columbia Supreme Court said he simply did not believe the testimony of witnesses who linked the men to the bombing. Calling them inconsistent, he said the accounts surfaced too late to be credible.He did, however, accept the Crown Court's theory that there wasa conspiracy to bring down two Air India flights by planting bombsin suitcases that were placed on planes leaving the Vancouver airport.Bagri and Malik, who had been on trial since April 28, 2003, were charged with first-degree murder over the death of 329 peopleas well as a variety of other charges connected with the bomb thatblew up Air India Flight 182 on June 23, 1985.The flight exploded and crashed off Ireland's Atlantic coast, on its way from Canada to India, via London. All 329 people on board, mostly Canadians, were killed.The two men were also accused of causing a separate bombing at Tokyo's Narita airport. Two baggage handlers died just 54 minutes before Flight 182 exploded when a bomb went off inside a suitcase they were transferring to another Air India plane, Flight 301.Canada's prosecutors alleged the bombings were an act of vengeance against the government of India following a 1984 raid onthe Golden Temple at Amritsar, the holiest shrine for Sikhs.
","A judge acquitted two Indian-Born Canadian Sikhs charged with bombing an Air India jumbo jet, killing 329 people. The unexpected end, after 19 months of a trial that cost $80 million dollars, left the worst case of mass murder in Canadian history an unsettled mystery. The judge, who had presided without a jury, said he did not believe the testimony of witnesses who linked the men to the bombing. The evidence had fallen ""markedly short"" of the standard required to convict the men. Families of passengers who perished proclaimed a ""mockery of justice"" and demanded a government investigation. ","In March 2005 Judge Josephson acquitted Ripudaman Malik and Ajaib Bagir on eight counts of murder and conspiracy because the government had failed to make a conclusive case. Plane crash victims' families were devastated and demanded a public inquiry. The Canadian Deputy Prime Minister could see no benefit to calling a public inquiry. The Canadian Police were disappointed at the call. Prosecutors sought grounds to appeal Josephson's ruling. Canada's newspapers were shocked at the acquittals of the two Sikhs and the Toronto-based Globe and Mail devoted its front page to the headline ""innocent"" and the names of the 329 victims. ","British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Ian Josephson has acquitted the two Canadian Sikhs ending the four-year trial that was conducted without a jury. He said that despite the horrific nature of the alleged crimes, there could be no lowering the standard of proof and that the assortment of prosecution witnesses lacked credibility. The decision devastated family members of the victims. Shocked prosecutors must ponder whether there is ground for appeal and defend their decision to bring the case to court. The feasibility of an appeal is in question because of strong wording of Josephson's verdict. The case remains open. ","On 16 March, the judge acquitted the two Canadian Sikhs charged in the Air India bombings. Saying that the prosecution's major witnesses were not credible, the British Columbia Supreme Court Justice stated that the prosecution had failed to prove the men guilty beyond a reasonable doubt but added that he was certain both bombs had originated on flights out of Vancouver. He had heard the case without a jury at the defendants' request. The two Sikhs were released immediately. The verdict shocked everyone. Many people sharply criticized the police and secret services and demanded a government investigation. "
D0944,D0944-A,"The US Supreme Court on Wednesday heard arguments on the legality ofthe death penalty for criminals aged under 18 in a case that hasreceived international attention.The outcome appeared in the balance with the nine member courtdivided and the result likely to be decided by the two moderatejustices.The Supreme Court has been asked to rule on the fate of ChristopherSimmons, who was condemned to death for the 1993 murder in Missouriof a woman who was abducted, tied up and thrown to her death from abridge. He was 17 at the time.The Missouri Supreme Court commuted Simmons' sentence to life inprison in 2003, and the state has appealed that decision.The US Supreme Court abolished the death sentence for those agedunder 16 in 1988.But the United States remains one of five countries that allow theexecution of those aged 16-18 and there has been growing domestic andinternational pressure to halt that as well.Only a few states still order executions for juveniles. They includeTexas and Alabama.The Simmons case would decide the fate of 73 people currently ondeath row across the United States for crimes committed when theywere minors.The three most conservative members of the court seemed to leantoward allowing the practice to continue. Opinions given for previouscases indicate that the court's four more progressive justices favorabolishing juvenile execution.Justice Anthony Kennedy, who along with Sandra Day O'Connor areconsidered the moderates, asked whether world opinion should be takeninto account.""No,"" answered James Layton, representing Missouri state which wantsSimmons executed.""Isn't it relevant?"" Justice Stephen Breyer asked, adding that he wasnot implying that it was up to the world to impose law on the UnitedStates.Kennedy said, ""What we do here should influence the rest of theworld.""O'Connor, who joined Kennedy in passing a 2002 decision barring theexecution of mentally ill people, appeared to agree.Quoting President Thomas Jefferson, one of the framers of the USConstitution, she said, ""To lead the world you must show a decentrespect of mankind.""The Missouri attorney argued that ""there are 17-year-olds that areequally culpable as 18-year-olds.""But Justice Ruth Ginsburg interrupted him to highlight that in theUnited States people under 18 years old cannot ""buy tobacco, vote,sit on a jury.""""Why would someone be death eligible but not eligible to be an adultmember of the community?"" she asked.O'Connor compared society's evolution toward opposing the juveniledeath penalty to its position on executing the mentally ill.""There was an inexorable trend concerning mental retardation, nothere,"" Layton said, adding that if the number of executions of minorshas decreased in the last few years it could rise in the future.In the last 10 years, only three states -- Oklahoma, Texas andVirginia -- have executed persons who were under 18.Only two teenagers were condemned to death in 2003, compared with 15in 1999.Kennedy said he was concerned that eliminating the death penalty foryoung criminals would remove a ""deterrent"", notably among gangmembers.But Simmons' attorney, Seth Waxman, replied that the death penaltywas a useless deterrent against minors since ""they weigh risksdifferently"" to adults.
Eleven years later, the chilling imagery of her sister's murder stillmakes Pertie Mitchell shiver.During a burglary, two teens stretched duct tape across ShirleyCrook's mouth and eyes, then muscled her into her van. An hour later,the hogtied woman was dumped off into the murky Meramec River.""Bubble, bubble,"" witnesses later said they heard Christopher Simmonssnicker as the woman's body sank.""It makes your hands sweat, your stomach sick,"" Mitchell said, hopingfor the day that Simmons is put to death. ""I will be there. I willwatch him die.""The execution is not certain, though. Using the Simmons case, theU.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday on whether it isconstitutional to execute killers who were juveniles when the crimeswere committed.The court agreed to hear the case after the Missouri Supreme Courtlast year struck down executions of juveniles and re-sentencedSimmons, now 28, to life in prison, deciding that such executionsviolate ""evolving standards of decency.""Nineteen states allow executions of killers who were 16 or 17 at thetime of the crime. Since the 1976 reinstatement of the death penalty,22 people _ 13 of them in Texas _ have been executed for crimescommitted as 16- or 17-year-olds.The U.S. Supreme Court in 1988 barred the death penalty for those 15and younger.Simmons and his attorneys did not reply to interview requests. Hisadvocates have said that executing people who kill as juveniles wouldbe just as wrong as putting to death the mentally challenged, apractice outlawed by the Supreme Court in 2002.People less than 18 years old, they argue, don't have fully developedbrains and are incapable of making rational decisions.Mitchell believes Simmons, who was then 17, was old enough to knowright from wrong.""You know how many people get married or join the service whenthey're 17 or 18 years old?"" said Mitchell, 66. ""This man has nothingto justify what he did.""Simmons' advocates argue that he led a tough life, from the time hisparents separated. Abuse by a relative, they said, included tying himas a toddler to a tree for hours to keep him from wandering while theman fished _ or taking him to a bar and plying him with alcohol forthe amusement of patrons.By 13, Simmons was smoking marijuana and swilling hard liquor. Hedabbled with mushrooms, cocaine and LSD, and broke into cars andhomes.About 2 a.m. on Sept. 9, 1993, Simmons and Charles Benjamin, then 15,found an open window at the home of Crook, a neighbor near St. Louis.Crook was sleeping alone inside; her husband Steven _ like her, atrucker _ was away on the road.Simmons bound her and forced her _ wearing only underwear and cowboyboots _ into her van. They drove 26 kilometers (16 miles) toCastlewood State Park, led her to the middle of the trestle above theMeramec and tossed her into the water.Two fishermen found the body 12 hours later.Authorities said Simmons privately boasted of killing Crook becauseshe had seen his face. He was arrested the next day.""I have a picture in my mind that she can't see, she can't speak, shecan't scream out,"" Crook's daughter, Kimberly Hawkins, said atSimmons' trial. ""I can imagine the terror that she's thinking.""Prosecutors called the crimes anything but impulsive. They saidSimmons believed he could escape punishment because he was ajuvenile.Simmons later claimed that any scheming was ""just stupid talk,"" andhe denied ever believing he could get away with it because he was aminor. He was sentenced to death in 1994.Benjamin, tried separately as an adult but not eligible for the deathsentence, given his age, was convicted and sentenced to life withoutparole.In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Benjamin, now 26,said he hopes Simmons prevails, thinking adolescence mitigatesculpability.""I believe age should factor in some way _ not the death penalty,""Benjamin said from prison. Crook's death, he said, is ""not somethingthat can be easily blocked out.""These days, Mitchell talks of little successes, like paring to justone the number of antidepressants she still takes to deal with thecrime that ""never leaves you.""""Can you imagine what Shirley must have been feeling, fighting for abreath of air and what her mind must have been saying to her? I thinkof that all the time,"" she said.""You'd think I'd cried enough, but it never ends.""
The Supreme Court on Wednesday struggled to assess the morality andpropriety of states' executing murderers who killed at age 16 or 17 _the ultimate punishment carried out in few places outside the UnitedStates.The court has outlawed executions for those 15 and under when theycommitted their crimes. Still, 19 of 50 states allow the deathpenalty for those older teenage killers.Justices debated whether such killers are children who cannot graspthe consequences of their actions and should be kept from death row,or criminals whose executions would ensure justice for victims anddeter other youths.The justices seemed sharply aware of the world audience as theydiscussed whether the executions are cruel and unusual punishment inviolation of the Constitution.They heard arguments in a Missouri case involving ChristopherSimmons, who at 17 kidnapped a neighbor and threw her off a bridge.Juvenile offenders have been put to death in recent years in just afew other countries, including Iran, Pakistan, China and SaudiArabia. All those countries have gone on record as opposing capitalpunishment for minors.""We are literally alone in the world,"" said Seth Waxman, Simmons'lawyer.Justices repeatedly referred to arguments filed on behalf of Simmonsby foreign leaders, Nobel Peace Prize winners and former U.S.diplomats.Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, a moderate expected to be a key swingvote, said that with world opinion against the punishment, ""Does thathave a bearing on what's unusual?""James Layton, representing the state of Missouri, said the court'sjudgment about unconstitutional punishment in America ""should not bebased on what happens in the rest of the world.""""Is there some special reason why what happens abroad would not berelevant here?"" Justice Stephen Breyer asked.Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, quoting from the U.S. Declaration ofIndependence, said that for the United States to lead, it must ""showa decent respect for the opinions of mankind.""Simmons was convicted of the 1993 murder of Shirley Crook.Prosecutors say he planned the burglary and killing. The victim,wearing only underwear and cowboy boots, was hog-tied and thrown offa bridge.Simmons was sentenced to die, but Missouri's highest court overturnedthe sentence last year.Justice Antonin Scalia, a death penalty supporter, said the courtcould be asked to declare juveniles too immature to face punishmentof any kind.""Why pick on the death penalty? Why not say they're immune from anycriminal penalty?"" he asked. ""I don't see where there's a logicalline.""The case has drawn intense interest. People carrying sleeping bagsarrived at the Supreme Court before midnight in hopes of getting aseat for the argument. It featured a lively debate that touched ongang violence, global influence on America and scientific evidenceabout the development of the teenage brain.The Supreme Court increasingly has looked at international opinion.The four most liberal members _ Ginsburg, Breyer, and Justices JohnPaul Stevens and David H. Souter _ have taken a stand against thedeath penalty for minors, saying it is ""a relic of the past and isinconsistent with evolving standards of decency in a civilizedsociety.""Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, also an important swing vote, spoke onlyonce during the arguments. She pointed out that the statistics aboutthe use of executions for juveniles showed the same consensus asexisted two years ago against executing the mentally retarded.About 20 states allowed executions of retarded people when the courtvoted 6-3 to outlaw them. Kennedy and O'Connor supported the 2002decision.
A possible revolution in the federal criminal justicesystem will be on the agenda when the Supreme Court opens its new termMonday.In a rare two-hour afternoon oral argument session, the justiceswill consider whether the federal sentencing guidelines -- a manual of400-plus pages meant to ensure that federal courts give defendantsacross the country approximately equal punishments for similar crimes-- can be reconciled with the Constitution.The court is hearing the case on an expedited schedule in responseto the uproar and confusion created by a 5 to 4 ruling it issued June24, just before leaving for summer recess.In that case, Blakely vs. Washington, the court struck downWashington state's sentencing guidelines, which, like the federalguidelines, permit judges to boost sentences based on their ownpost-conviction fact-finding, rather than relying only on factsadmitted by the defendant or found by a jury.That, the court ruled, violates the right to a jury trialguaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.Though the court said in Blakely that it did not address thefederal guidelines, the similarities between Washington's system andthe federal system were such that defense lawyers across the countryimmediately began bombarding courts with Blakely challenges to theirclients' sentences.Lower courts have issued differing rulings in response, and somefederal prosecutors have felt obliged to redraft indictments to makesure they conform to Blakely.``It looks like a Number 10 earthquake to me,'' Justice Sandra DayO'Connor, who dissented in Blakely, told a conference of federaljudges in July.Although determining the precise magnitude of the Blakelyaftershocks is the court's first major item of business, Blakely is byno means the only case of potential national significance on thecourt's docket.On Oct. 13, the court will hear arguments in Roper vs. Simmons, No.03-633, a challenge to the constitutionality of the death penalty forpersons who commit crimes while younger than 18.The court has barred capital punishment for those younger than 16,but it ruled in 1989 that capital punishment for 16- and 17-year-olddefendants does not constitute ``cruel and unusual punishment.''However, the court may decide that a ``national consensus'' has nowformed against imposing the ultimate penalty against minors -- just asit did in 2002 with respect to the death penalty for moderatelymentally retarded offenders.It is nearly certain that the court's two swing voters, JusticesO'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy, will determine the outcome. Fourmembers of the court -- John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth BaderGinsburg and Stephen G. Breyer -- have already declared in a publishedopinion that they believe the death penalty for juveniles should beabolished.Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia andClarence Thomas opposed the 2002 mental retardation ruling, whichopponents of capital punishment for juveniles are relying on to maketheir case.(Optional Add End) If the court throws out the sentencing guidelines, the issue willreturn to Congress. Early congressional reactions to Blakely suggestthat the ultimate result of scrapping the guidelines would be harsherpenalties prescribed by politicians reluctant to be seen as soft oncrime.''(I)t may take only a couple of lenient sentences in high-profilecases to raise enough of a stir to increase mandatory minimumpenalties,'' Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) said at a July 13 hearing ofthe Senate Judiciary Committee.
The Supreme Court justices, a solemn and sober lot,will spend time this fall talking about wine, beef, marijuana anddogs, all part of their wide-ranging duty to police the limits of thegovernment's power.They will also consider whether young murderers can be put to deathfor their crimes.But when the court's term officially opens Monday, the first orderof business will be to answer a question raised at the end of the lastterm: Is the federal sentencing system, which punishes 64,000criminals a year, unconstitutional because it allows judges, actingalone, to add to prison terms?If so, the Supreme Court may force a profound shift in howcriminals are sentenced in America, one that will affect the statecourts in many states as well as the federal system.Until now, the general understanding has been that prosecutorscharge defendants with a crime, juries typically decide whether theyare guilty and, if so, judges impose the punishment. In recentrulings, however, a narrow Supreme Court majority has said the rightto a jury trial also includes the right to have a jury decide the keyfacts that determine a sentence.Other than a prior conviction, ``any fact that increases thepenalty for a crime'' must be decided by the jury or admitted by thedefendant, Justice Antonin Scalia said for a 5-4 majority in the caseof Blakeley vs. Washington.That simple statement struck down the sentencing system inWashington state, and it now threatens to do the same in the federalsystem. In both, judges are authorized to decide the ``aggravatingfactors'' that increase a prison term.Take, for example, the case of Ducan Fanfan, who last year sold asmall bag of cocaine to an informer outside a Burger King restaurantnear Portland, Maine. A jury found him guilty as charged of selling atleast 500 grams of cocaine, a crime that called for six years inprison under U.S. sentencing guidelines.On June 28, four days after the Blakely ruling, Fanfan came beforea federal judge for sentencing. Prosecutors said the defendant was theleader of a drug gang who had 2.5 kilograms of cocaine in his home andcar. Based on these facts -- which the judge found to be true --Fanfan should go to prison for 16 years.However, imposing such a stiff sentence would be unconstitutionalunder the just-announced Blakely ruling, the judge concluded. So hesent Fanfan to prison for six years based on just the jury's verdict.Bush administration lawyers appealed Fanfan's case directly to theSupreme Court. They argued that it made a ``mockery'' of the law bypermitting judges to give more lenient sentences based on certainfacts but forbidding them from increasing the sentences based on otherfacts.Fanfan's is one of two cases that will be heard Monday afternoon asthe justices debate what to do with the federal sentencing system.The outcome is likely to affect most state courts.The future of the death penalty for young murderers also is indoubt. Four liberal justices -- John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter,Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer -- have already said theyview such as executions as ``shameful'' and a ``relic of the past.''If they are joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor or Anthony M.Kennedy, the court would limit capital punishment to those who are age18 or older at the time of their crime.Since 1990, only Texas, Oklahoma and Virginia have carried outexecutions of young murderers. The justices will take up a Missouricase, Roper vs. Simmons, on Oct. 13 to decide the issue.The wine and marijuana cases will come before the court inDecember.As wine has grown in popularity, many wine drinkers have askedwhether they can order their favorite vintage from a distant vineyardand have it shipped directly to them. The answer depends on statelaws.About half the states forbid all direct shipments of wine acrosstheir borders. Only licensed wholesalers are permitted to importalcohol, and they in turn sell it to retailers. The states rely on the21st Amendment, which repealed the prohibition on alcohol sales andwas approved in 1933, for this authority. The amendment states that``importation into any state . . . of intoxicating liquors is herebyprohibited.'' Although all states permit the sale of alcohol, they doso only through their own sets of regulations.Eleanor Heald, a wine critic from Troy, Mich., and David Lucas, theowner of a small winery near Lodi, Calif., are challenging the bans onwine shipments to Michigan and New York. In the case of Granholm vs.Heald, they argue that the Constitution calls for a free flow ofcommerce across state lines, including that of alcohol.``This case will determine whether consumers or a cartel ofbillion-dollar distributors will determine what wine is available toconsumers in New York or two dozen other states,'' said Clint Bolickof the Washington-based Institute for Justice, who represents Lucas.The case of John Ashcroft vs. Angel Raich may determine the fate ofthe medical marijuana laws in nine states. Raich, who suffers from abrain tumor, uses homegrown marijuana to relieve her pain. This islegal under the Compassionate Use Act approved by California's voters.However, Ashcroft, the U.S. attorney general, says federal druglaws forbid all use of marijuana. Federal agents raided the homes ofseveral Californian patients who grew their own.In the last decade, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, theconservative leader, has insisted on limiting federal power. Forexample, he spoke for a 5-4 majority that struck down the federalGun-Free Schools Zone Act on the grounds that mere gun possession didnot involve interstate commerce. The liberal dissenters said the courtshould uphold the broad power of Congress.Last year, the liberal 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals turned thetables. Relying on the logic of Rehnquist's opinion, it ruled the useof homegrown marijuana was beyond the federal authority because it didnot involve interstate commerce.The court also will hear a challenge to a unique California prisonpolicy that segregates new inmates by race for as many as 60 days.Prison officials say they seek to prevent gang violence while newinmates are evaluated. Lawyers for Garrison Johnson, a black inmate,say racial segregation is unconstitutional in all instances.The courtalso will decide whether police can use drug-sniffing dogs in routinetraffic stops. Usually, officers need some evidence of a drug crimebefore they search for narcotics. But prosecutors contend that when atrained dog sniffs the air, it is not engaged in a search, andtherefore police may use dogs whenever and however they choose.The agriculture industry will be closely watching a case aboutgovernment-sponsored ad campaigns. Cattlemen are challenging the feesthey must pay for ads such as ``Beef, It's What for Dinner.''Dozens of similar ad campaigns are sponsored by the U.S. Departmentof Agriculture as well as many states. A ruling in the case of Venemanvs. Livestock Marketing Association could free farmers from having topay for them.
A plea to declare capital punishment for juvenileoffenders unconstitutional received a skeptical hearing at the SupremeCourt Wednesday, as one of two justices likely to be pivotal to theoutcome voiced repeated doubts.Justice Anthony Kennedy observed that he was ``troubled'' that aban might lead gang leaders to use 16- or 17-year-olds as ``hit men.''``I'm very concerned about that,'' Kennedy told Seth Waxman, aformer solicitor general of the United States who was arguing onbehalf of Missouri death row inmate Christopher Simmons, who facesexecution for a murder he committed at 17. ``I'm talking about thedeterrent value of the existing rule.''Waxman replied that deterrence does not work with juvenileoffenders because they ``are impulsive and subject to peer pressure.''But Kennedy responded that many 17-year-old offenders were``ringleaders'' in brutal, calculated murders, according to afriend-of-the-court brief filed by a group of states that wish toretain a death penalty for juveniles. Kennedy said the brief was``chilling reading.''Kennedy's vote is crucial because four justices, John Paul Stevens,David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, have alreadydeclared their belief that executing those who commit crimes whileunder the age of 18 is ``cruel and unusual punishment.''The records of Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices AntoninScalia and Clarence Thomas suggest that they think the issue should beleft up to the states.That leaves only Kennedy and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor aspossible fifth votes for a ban. O'Connor was mostly silent inWednesday's hearing.The Supreme Court upheld capital punishment for 16- and 17-year-oldoffenders in 1989. It banned it for those 15 and under in 1988.Until now, the court's position has been unaffected by its 2002decision to ban the death penalty for the moderately mentallyretarded. In that case, Kennedy and O'Connor joined Stevens, Souter,Ginsburg and Breyer.The court found that a national consensus against the practice hadformed since 1989. The best evidence for that, the court ruled, wasthat the number of states banning the death penalty for the retardedhad grown from two to 13.Many death penalty opponents immediately recognized that a similarargument could be applied to juveniles.Yet in the 2002 opinion, written by Stevens, the court seemed towarn that it was not ready for that, contrasting the strong trendagainst executing the retarded with the fact that, between 1989 and2002, only two states had raised their death penalty ages to 18.Three times in the last two years, the court refused to hearappeals from death-row inmates who had killed while juveniles --despite a strongly worded dissent in one case from Stevens, Souter,Ginsburg and Breyer.Last year, the court actually reinstated the death penalty of ajuvenile offender in Oklahoma after a federal appeals court hadblocked it. The vote was 5 to 4, with both Kennedy and O'Connor in themajority.The court intervened in the Simmons case only after the MissouriSupreme Court threw out Simmons' sentence last year on the groundsthat the 1989 precedent had, indeed, been superseded by the 2002 case.Waxman pressed a similar argument Wednesday. He told the court thatthe execution of juvenile criminals conflicts with a ``robustconsensus'' reflected in the recent decisions of several states to banthe practice and in the decreasing frequency with which juriesactually impose the death penalty on those under 18. Scientificevidence shows that areas of the brain in charge of judgment andimpulse control are incomplete in adolescents, he said.Death is the wrong punishment for crimes that reflect ``thetransient psychosocial characteristics that rage in adolescents,''Waxman said.But Kennedy noted that the American Psychological Association --which told the court in a brief in this case that adolescents were tooimmature to qualify for capital punishment -- had also said in a caseabout parental notification for abortion that teen-agers were oldenough to make such a decision on their own.``They flip-flopped,'' Kennedy said.Waxman said there was no inconsistency, because ``what was at issuein that case was the competency to decide,'' while the question inthis case is ``factors why adolescents are less morally culpable.''He also urged the court to act based on a ``worldwide consensus''against the death penalty for juveniles, noting that except for theUnited States, all 110 countries that retain capital punishment do notapply it to those under 18.States that permit it ``are not just alone in this country, theyare alone in the world,'' he said.On this point, Kennedy appeared to sympathize with Waxman, askingMissouri state solicitor James Layton, ``There seems to be a verysubstantial demonstration that world opinion is against us. ... Doesthat have a bearing on what's `unusual''' punishment?Layton replied that ``what matters'' is American legislation.O'Connor's only remark also hinted at some openness to Waxman'sposition.Addressing Layton, she noted that the number of states that eitherdo not have capital punishment or set the age at 18 is ``about thesame'' as the number of those that banned executing the retarded in2002, which was 30.``There is no inexorable trend here,'' Layton replied.The case is Roper vs. Simmons. A decision is expected by July.
The Supreme Court struggled Wednesday over whetherthe time has come to end the death penalty for young murderers. Nowthat Iran and Congo say they have repudiated the practice, the UnitedStates stands alone in the world in sanctioning the execution ofminors.Two years ago, the court in a 6-3 decision abolished capitalpunishment for the mentally retarded, saying that a ``nationalconsensus'' had emerged that executing such persons amounted to crueland unusual punishment. They noted that all but a handful of stateshad exempted mentally retarded persons from the death penalty.On Wednesday, the justices debated whether a similar nationalconsensus exists that now calls for limiting capital punishment tomurderers who are age 18 or above when they commit crimes.Despite the vote of two years ago, it was not clear fromWednesday's argument that a majority would exempt youthful killers.Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said he was worried that teenagecriminals will be emboldened if they are free from the full force ofthe criminal law. ``Juveniles run in gangs,'' he said, reasoning thatgang members would dodge the death penalty by recruiting theiryoungest members as ``the hit man.''``I'm very concerned about that,'' said Kennedy, who voted in themajority to stop the death penalty for mentally retarded individuals.Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the other swing vote, noted thatseveral states in recent years have raised the minimum age to 18 forimposing the death penalty. ``It's about the same consensus thatexisted on mental retardation,'' she said, in a hopeful sign for thefoes of capital punishment.Currently, most states either have no death penalty law or set 18as the minimum age. Still, 19 states permit prosecutors to seek adeath sentence for murderers who are 16 or 17, although fewer havedone so of late. In 1999, for example, 14 underage murderers receiveddeath sentences, but the number has declined steadily. Only twoteenage murderers received death sentences last year and only one suchsentence has been handed down this year.The clear leader remains Texas. As of June 30, 72 people who were16 or 17 at the time of their crimes sat on death rows around thenation, and 28 of them were in Texas.The case before the court Wednesday came from Missouri. Itconcerned Christopher Simmons, who in 1993 abducted a woman in hisneighborhood, bound her in duct tape and threw her alive into a riverfrom a railroad bridge. He was 17 at the time of the murder andbragged to a friend that he would get off because of his age.Instead, a jury outside St. Louis convicted him and sentenced himto die. The Missouri Supreme Court voided the death sentence andordered him to spend life in prison, and the state attorney generalfiled an appeal.James Layton, a Missouri state attorney, urged the justices to letjuries weigh each case and decide for themselves when a murdererdeserves death.If the age for capital punishment needs to be changed, it should bedone by elected lawmakers, not judges, he said. ``Age is a legislativequestion. It is the kind of fact a legislature should decide, not thiscourt,'' he argued.Seth Waxman, the former U.S. solicitor general in the Clintonadministration, argued for Simmons and he urged the high court to seta constitutional rule that limits capital punishment to those who arelegally adults.In law, ``18 is the bright line between childhood and adulthood,''he said. Since young people need to be age 18 to vote, to join themilitary, to gamble, or even to marry without their parents' consent,it is reasonable to set 18 as the minimum age for capital punishment,he said.``We are literally alone in the world'' in permitting theexecutions of those who committed crimes as juveniles, Waxman said.The United Nations Commission on Human Rights said six nationsbesides the United States executed juvenile offenders during the1990s. They are Congo, Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia andYemen. But its report said all of these countries have repudiated thepractice in the past five years.A long list of other groups, including the American MedicalAssociation, the American Psychological Association, the U.S.Conference of Catholic Bishops, the European Union and Nobel Prizelaureates led by former President Carter, filed briefs urging thecourt to halt the execution of young offenders.Four justices -- John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth BaderGinsburg and Stephen G. Breyer -- have said in the past they believesuch executions are a ``shameful practice'' and should be abolished.Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia andClarence Thomas have said the court should leave the issue to thestates.The justices will meet behind closed doors later this week to voteon the case of Roper vs. Simmons. A ruling is due in several months.
For release Sunday, Oct. 3WASHINGTON -- The death penalty, drugs and civil rights are beforethe Supreme Court in its new term, which begins Monday withrelatively little public notice amid the presidential campaign'sfinal month.While President Bush and Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., pound away at eachother on the stump, the nine justices will start their session at 10a.m. with the court's marshal saying, ""God save the United States andthis honorable court.""But the calm of the courtroom is probably what the deliberativejustices would prefer this fall, just four years after a presidentialelection in which they attracted global attention and essentiallycast the deciding vote.""They (the justices) are probably perfectly happy that people areconcerned about other things,"" said attorney Theodore Olson, whoargued Bush's case in the 5-4 decision in Bush v. Gore that ended theFlorida recount, sealing Bush's victory. The justices, however, wouldnot shy away if this year's election also arrived at their doorstep,added Olson, who served from 2001 until July as U.S. solicitorgeneral, President Bush's top lawyer before the high court.The justices this year have already shown that they are not afraid torevisit earlier rulings.In taking the case of a man convicted of murder when he was 17, thecourt will reconsider its 1989 decision in Stanford v. Kentucky thatthe Constitution permits the execution of 16-year-old killers. Toraise that minimum age, the court would need to decide that anational consensus has emerged since that year that it is cruel andunusual to execute murderers who had not reached adulthood when theycommitted their crime.Attorneys for the man, Christopher Simmons, are urging the SupremeCourt to do for youngsters on death row what it did two years ago forcondemned killers who have mental retardation. In 2002, it overturneda 1989 ruling that had permitted executing the mentally retarded,saying that a national consensus had emerged that executing suchpeople violated the Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusualpunishment. It based its decision largely on the growing number ofdeath-penalty states to have outlawed such executions: up from two in1989 to 16 in 2002.But Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon says the court should holdfast to its decision allowing the execution of minors. Some killingsare so heinous as to warrant not only charging minors as adults -- asis often the case today -- but to hold them to the ultimate penaltyas well, he argues.Simmons was convicted and sentenced to death in 1993, when he was 17,for forcing Shirley Crook from her bed, tying her hands and legstogether with electric cable, covering her face with duct tape andpushing her from a railroad trestle into a river below, where shedrowned. The Missouri Supreme Court last year upheld the convictionbut threw out the death sentence, saying that to execute someone forcrimes committed before reaching age 18 would be cruel and unusual inlight of current societal standards.The justices will hear arguments in the Missouri case, Roper v.Simmons, on Oct. 13 and render their decision by the summer.(Optional add begins)Nixon, pressing Missouri's appeal to the justices, assails thatruling as violating the U.S. Supreme Court's still valid decisionfrom 1989 that executing 17 year olds is permissible. Though theMissouri court might feel times have changed, it must continue torely on the justices' determination, he writes in the state's appeal.The attorney general also disputes that a national consensus hasemerged against executing childhood offenders, saying it has becomeincreasingly common during the past decade for violent youngoffenders to be tried and sentenced as adults.Countering the state, Simmons' lawyers argue that the Missouri courtmerely followed the justices' test for determining whether decencystandards have evolved sufficiently to warrant a change in applyingthe death penalty. Death-penalty states during the past decade havemoved to abolish the punishment as applied to minors, and the numberof killers under age 18 sentenced to death has dropped from 14 in1999 to two last year, the lawyers said, citing data fromstatistician Victor Streib.(Optional add ends)In a case on marijuana, the justices will consider whether Congressoverstepped its authority by outlawing marijuana use for medicinalpurposes when the plant is grown in the same state where it isprescribed.The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that the federalControlled Substances Act cannot be enforced against two Californiaresidents who were prescribed marijuana to treat debilitating medicalconditions. The San Francisco-based court said Congress'constitutional authority to regulate interstate commerce cannot beinvoked to outlaw the medicinal use of marijuana grown, prescribedand used in the same state.Appealing that decision to the justices, the government says Congresscan outlaw the intrastate use of dangerous drugs even if state lawallows doctors to prescribe them. It argues the use of illegal drugscannot be confined to one state, but rather inevitably spills overinto interstate trade, which Congress can regulate.""Local manufacturing, possession and use of controlled substancesincrease the demand for such drugs, which in turn leads to increasedsupply and marketing to users,"" the government states in papers filedwith the high court.The California residents counter that using marijuana on a limited,as medically necessary basis has no significant impact on theinterstate drug trade. In addition, Congress tramples on states'rights when it seeks to regulate the use of a drug that state lawsays may be prescribed for certain medical conditions, Angel Raichand Diane Monson state in papers filed with the justices.Raich suffers from a variety of chronically painful medicalconditions, including scoliosis, joint dysfunction, headaches,multiple chemical sensitivities, asthma and seizures. Monson suffersfrom a degenerative spinal disease that causes chronic back pain andpainful muscle spasms. They each have been prescribed marijuana torelieve the pain, which is permitted under California's 1996Compassionate Use Act.Eight other states have enacted similar ""medical marijuana"" laws,including Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Nevada, Oregon, Vermontand Washington.The case is Ashcroft v. Raich.In a coaching case testing civil rights, Roderick Jackson claims theBirmingham, Ala., Board of Education fired him in 2001 as ahigh-school girls basketball coach after he protested to supervisorsthat his team was not receiving the same funding and access toathletic facilities as the boys' squad. Jackson sued the board,claiming that his retaliatory firing violated Title IX of the federal1972 Education Amendments, which requires equal treatment of boys andgirls teams in scholastic sports.The U.S. District Court for Northern Alabama dismissed Jackson'slawsuit, saying Title IX has no provision allowing people to sue forretaliatory actions by school officials. The Atlanta-based 11th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals agreed.In his appeal to the Supreme Court, Jackson argues that the right tosue for retaliation is implicit in any anti-discrimination law.Accordingly, the U.S. Education Department has adopted regulationsthat protect teachers who complain about illegal bias, Jackson statesin papers filed with the justices.""If schools and other defendants could freely retaliate against thosewho protest discriminatory treatment, they would effectively beengaging in the discrimination prohibited by the statute,"" Jacksonwrote.The U.S. government supports Jackson's position in a legal brieffiled with the court.""Just as Title IX's broad prohibition against intentionaldiscrimination covers other forms of intentional discrimination towhich the statute does not specifically refer (e.g. sexualharassment), it covers intentionally discriminatory retaliation,"" thegovernment states. ""Teachers and coaches are often in a much betterposition to identify sex discrimination and express opposition to itthan are the students who are denied equal educationalopportunities.""The school board counters that courts should not read into Title IX aright to sue that is not explicitly stated in the statute.The case is Jackson v. Birmingham Board of Education.The court is expected to render by the summer its decisions in theapproximately 80 cases it will hear between October and April. Thecoming term marks the 11th consecutive one with the same ninejustices, further extending this panel's modern record for SupremeCourt stability.
Three months ago, the Supreme Court issued an opinion that seemed tooutlaw the way much of the nation sentences criminals. Then they wenton vacation, leaving judges, prosecutors, and thousands of defendantsconfused about what to do. As the justices return to work Monday,their first task is to belatedly explain the new rules.The new term is dominated by criminal justice matters, with casesinvolving the death penalty for juveniles, medical marijuana,drug-sniffing police dogs during routine traffic stops, and thecontinued detention of Cubans brought over during the Marielboat-lift who finished their prison sentences but cannot be returnedto Cuba because Fidel Castro will not take them back.But before the court can take on the new issues, it will revisit its5-to-4 decision last term in Blakeley v. Washington.In that case, it struck down guidelines under which judges add timeto the normal range for a sentence based on aggravating facts notfound beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury - for example, increasingthe penalty for a kidnapping conviction if the offense involved cruelmistreatment of a victim. The majority said such a system violatesthe Constitution's guarantee of a jury trial.Because as many as 21 states and the federal government use a similararrangement, the ruling cast much of the criminal justice system intodoubt and had an immediate impact on thousands of open cases. But thejustices neglected to explain the implications of their decision, andlower courts have come up with wildly different interpretations ofwhat it meant.""They went off for three months on vacation, leaving a lot of peoplescrambling to figure out how to make the system work,"" said JulieO'Sullivan, a law professor at Georgetown University. ""That struck meas an irresponsible and arrogant thing to do. They have to decidejust how much remains of the federal sentencing system.""Seeking an opinion that will clear up the confusion, the federalgovernment asked for expedited review of the cases of Duncan Fanfanand Freddie J. Booker, both convicts challenging their guideline-setsentences. At risk is the whole system of judges examining the factsafter a basic jury verdict to come up with sentences that distinguishbetween bad and worse instances of a crime. If the court strikes downguidelines, many current defendants could receive only a minimumsentence. But that defense victory could prove Pyrrhic: Analysts saylegislatures could respond by imposing harsher mandatory sentences.The arguments Monday will kick off a near-record 10th term for thecourt without a lineup change. Few expect the aging panel to remainintact another four years, so the upcoming presidential election'smost long-lasting impact may be in deciding who gets to nominatemultiple replacements, thus transforming its current balance into acontrolling ideological majority.In the meantime, the justices have filled half the term's calendarand continue to review other appeals; one closely watched potentialcase is a challenge to Florida's ban on gay adoptions. Rulings willbe issued by the end of the term in June.No terrorism case is on the calendar following the court's historicdecision in that arena last term, when it sharply curtailed PresidentBush's claimed wartime power to indefinitely imprison suspectedterrorists beyond the reach of judicial review. But there are severalcases dealing with the detention and deportation of noncitizens.In Clark v. Martinez and Benitez v. Bozos, for example, the courtwill decide whether the government can continue to indefinitelyimprison Cuban criminals from the 1980 Mariel boat-lift who werenever granted legal entry into the United States, but were ""paroled""into the country.Having committed crimes and served out their sentences, they facedeportation. But Cuba refuses to accept them, so they and about 900others are locked up in limbo. In 2001, the court ruled thatdetaining legal immigrants for more than six months wasunconstitutional. This case will decide whether people who have notlegally entered the country have the same rights.One case of local interest is Smith v. Massachusetts, which comesfrom a 1996 shooting in Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood. Thecourt must decide whether defendant Melvin Smith's ""double jeopardy""protection against successive prosecution was violated when a judgefirst granted a defense motion to declare him not guilty of a charge,then withdrew that verdict and allowed the charge to go to a jury.A Connecticut case, Kelo v. New London, will determine whether agovernment can use eminent domain to clear space for privateredevelopment. The Fifth Amendment limits the power to forceunwilling owners to sell in cases where the property will be put to""public use,"" usually for something like a road. Here, a neighborhoodwould be razed for the ""public purpose"" of generating greater taxrevenue.Roper v. Simmons presents the court with an opportunity to strikedown the death penalty for crimes committed by a juvenile. The casearrives two years after its decision to strike down the death penaltyfor mentally retarded criminals.The court had upheld both policies in 1989. In reversing course forcriminals with diminished mental abilities, it reasoned thatsociety's evolving standard of decency had reached a consensus thatsuch criminals were less culpable than people of normal intelligenceand so executing themis considered ""cruel and unusual punishment"" prohibited by the EighthAmendment.Challengers to the juvenile death penalty similarly argue that thenumber of death sentences for offenses committed by minors hasdwindled and there is a growing reluctance to carry out suchexecutions.Because nearly the entire world has outlawed the juvenile deathpenalty, court watchers are interested in whether justices will citeforeign practices, as some did when striking down sodomy laws twoyears ago. The emerging trend of looking abroad for comparative inputhas drawn fire from conservatives, who say only domestic law shouldbe relevant.In Illinois v. Caballes, the court will decide whether police maysearch a car with a drug-sniffing dog during a routine traffic stopwithout an individualized reason to be suspicious. The case hinges onwhat expectation of privacy people driving in their car have.In Ashcroft v. Reich, the court will consider whether federal agentslack authority to interfere with medical marijuana grown by seriouslyill people who do not take it across state lines. California voterslegalized medicinal marijuana in state law eight years ago, but itremains illegal under federal law.The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, a generally liberalcourt based in San Francisco, ruled that home-grown and home-consumedmarijuana is not related to interstate commerce, and so theConstitution does not give Congress the authority to regulate it.That invokes the same reasoning that conservative majorities on theSupreme Court have used to strike down federal laws against guns inschools and violence against women. But the Supreme Court frequentlyreverses the Ninth Circuit and has consistently rejected challengesto federal drug laws.""This represents another case in an ongoing battle between theSupreme Court and the Ninth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit is playinggames,"" said Michael Gottesman, a law professor at Georgetown. ""Ifyou play games and the other side is the Supreme Court, you're notgoing to win.""
The Supreme Court opens its new term Monday faced with urgentbusiness and looming uncertainty.The justices' most pressing task is to resolve the fate of thefederal criminal sentencing system, which the court itself threw intolimbo in June by declaring unconstitutional a similar, although notidentical, system used by the state of Washington.In both the state and federal systems, sentencing guidelines providea starting point for calculating a criminal sentence, and judges thenmake findings about a variety of factors to determine how much time adefendant will actually serve. The Supreme Court ruled in Blakely v.Washington that the state system violated the constitutional right totrial by jury by permitting judges to make these essential findings.Federal judges around the country quickly started ruling that theycould no longer treat the federal sentencing guidelines as binding.Whether that judgment is correct and, if so, what should happen nextwill be the subject of an unusual afternoon argument on Monday in twocases that the justices -- in August -- granted at the JusticeDepartment's request and agreed to expedite for an argument.While the sentencing cases alone -- United States v. Booker, No.04-104, and United States v. Fanfan, No. 04-105 -- would mark this asan unusually important term for criminal law, the justices have alsoagreed to decide a significant death penalty case. The question inRoper v. Simmons, No. 03-633, is whether executing someone convictedof committing a capital murder at the age of 16 or 17 offends""evolving standards of decency in a civilized society."" That is thetest the court applies to decide whether a punishment is ""cruel andunusual"" within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment.In 1988, the court prohibited the execution of those whose crimeswere committed at 15 or younger, but refused the next year to extendthat decision to 16- and 17-year-olds. Although there have been fewexecutions for juvenile crimes in recent years, the United States isone of only a handful of nations where such executions are stilllegal, and the case has attracted worldwide attention. Seventy-threepeople are currently on death row in 12 states -- one-third of themin Texas -- for crimes committed before the age of 18.
","Roper vs. Simmons presented the Supreme Court a chance to strike down the death penalty for crimes committed by 16-17-year-olds. Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer were expected to vote against the death penalty while Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and Thomas would be for it. Justices Kennedy and O'Connor appeared to be ""swing votes."" In the initial hearing Kennedy expressed concerns about exempting 16-17-year-olds but also noted that ""world opinion is against us"" in executing juveniles. O'Connor noted that several states had already raised the minimum age for execution to 18. ","On October 13, 2004, the Supreme Court struggled over the legality of the death penalty for criminals under age 18 in Roper v. Simmons. Simmons' attorney argued that a national consensus has emerged that the death penalty for juveniles is cruel and unusual punishment. He compared this case to the 2002 case in which the court abolished the death penalty for mentally retarded offenders. The Missouri Attorney General argued that the court should uphold the execution of minors because some crimes are so heinous as to warrant it. Justices Kennedy's and Day O'Connor's votes are likely to be pivotal. ","The Supreme Court heard arguments on Roper v Simmons on October 13, 2004. Its decision will determine whether the death penalty can be given for crimes committed by 16 and 17 year olds. The court ended the death penalty for those 15 and younger in 1988 and mentally retarded in 2002. The outcome appears dependent on the votes of Justices O'Connor and Kennedy. Key issues are has the nation's consensus changed, should world consensus influence US law, and the brain development of these youngsters. Since 1976, 22 have been executed. Now 73 people are on death row in 12 states. ",In Roper v. Simmons the Supreme Court heard arguments challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty for criminals under 18. The defense argued that minors were not fully developed intellectually or morally and that therefore such executions violate the constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. It asserted that a national consensus had emerged on that subject and pointed out that the U.S. is the only country in the world that allows the execution of juveniles. Prosecutors contended that Simmons was old enough to know right from wrong and challenged the notion that a national consensus had emerged. 
D0944,D0944-B,"The US Supreme Court on Tuesday abolished the death penalty for those convicted of crimes they committed as minors.The US high court upheld an earlier ruling by the Missouri Supreme Court banning the execution of those convicted of crimes they committed before turning 18. That ruling had found execution to be in violation of the constitutional protection against ""cruel and unusual punishment.""The court had ruled in 1988 that the execution of offenders who were younger than 16 when they committed their crimes was unconstitutional, but a few US states continued to execute perpetrators who committed crimes at 16 or 17. The court cited changing cultural standards for its decision.The Supreme Court was considering the case of Christopher Simmons, who was condemned to death for the 1993 murder in Missouri of a woman who was abducted, tied up and thrown to her death from a bridge. He was 17 at the time.Simmons's attorney, Seth Waxman, had argued that the death penalty was a useless deterrent for minors, since ""they weigh risks differently"" than adults do.
Eight months has made a lifetime of difference for ChristopherSimmons.Because Simmons was that many months shy of his 18th birthday when he tossed awoman to her death off a railroad trestle, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Tuesdaythat he cannot be executed for the murder.The ruling in Simmons' case also spared the life of 72 death row inmates acrossthe nation who were younger than 18 when they committed murder and bars statesfrom seeking to execute minors for future crimes.For Simmons, now 28, it means a long life in prison _ for which he is eternallygrateful. Learning of the court decision from a television report, Simmons triedunsuccessfully to call his family, then got through to one of hisattorneys.""The first thing he said was, 'Thank you very, very much,'"" said Kansas Cityattorney Pat Berrigan, whose client denied an interview request.Simmons had been praying fervently for the nation's high court to uphold a 2003decision by the Missouri Supreme Court that banned juvenile executions, Berrigansaid.""I think he sees some of God's work in this result,"" he said.In its 5-4 ruling, the high court said the execution of juvenile offendersviolates the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusualpunishment. The decision invalidated the practice of 19 states and overturned a1989 high court precedent in another Missouri case that had allowed executionsfor offenders as young as 16.It also brought the United States in line with much of the rest of the world,something Justice Anthony Kennedy noted while concluding that juveniles lack thematurity and intellectual development to understand the ramifications of theiractions.""The age of 18 is the point where society draws the line for many purposesbetween childhood and adulthood. It is, we conclude, the age at which the linefor death eligibility ought to rest,"" Kennedy wrote for the court'smajority.In dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia disputed that a ""national consensus"" existsagainst juvenile executions and insisted those decisions should be left tostates.The impact was immediate. In Prince William County, Virginia, officials saidTuesday they will not prosecute a murder case against teen sniper Lee BoydMalvo, who already is serving life in prison in two of the 10 sniper killingsthat terrorized the Washington area in 2002.The ruling continues the court's practice of narrowing the scope of the deathpenalty, which it reinstated in 1976. Executions for those 15 and younger whenthey committed their crimes were outlawed in 1988. Three years ago, justicesbanned executions of the mentally retarded, citing a ""national consensus""against executing a killer who may lack the intelligence to fully understand hiscrime.In finding a similar consensus against juvenile executions, the court noted thatmost states bar them and those that allow them do so infrequently. Only threestates _ Oklahoma, Texas and Virginia _ have executed people who committedcrimes as juveniles in the past 10 years.The latest case arose from the September 1993 murder of Shirley Crook, who wasbound up during a nighttime burglary by Simmons and 15-year-old CharlesBenjamin. She was taken from her home wearing only underwear and cowboy bootsand shoved off a train trestle into the Meramec River. Prosecutors contendedSimmons planned the killing and bragged he could escape punishment because ofhis age, something Simmons later denied.Crook's relatives criticized the Supreme Court's conclusion that juvenilesaren't as culpable for their actions as adults.""We felt it was a cold-blooded murder,"" said Tom Mitchell, whose wife, Pertie,is Crook's sister. ""I don't know that life in prison is ever considered a pass,but he's not having to pay the same penalty that he caused Pertie's sister topay.""Jefferson County Prosecutor Bob Wilkins, who took office just months afterSimmons' trial, said he still believes it is appropriate to allow the deathpenalty for some teenage murderers.""If any case ever was deserving of the death penalty, this was it,"" Wilkinssaid. ""It was one of the most heinous offenses that any of us ever are going tosee.""Since entering prison, Simmons has embraced his Christian faith, joined severalministry and youth programs and helped as a hospice aide caring for inmates withAIDS, Berrigan said.In January, Simmons was transferred to the same prison cell block as Benjamin,who was tried separately and sentenced to life in prison. The two co-defendantshave occasionally talked about their fates, Benjamin said in a telephoneinterview Tuesday from prison. Simmons wanted to live and had been anxiouslyawaiting the Supreme Court decision.Benjamin said he would have preferred to have been executed, adding that alifetime in prison should provide a strong deterrent to otherteens.""Maybe one of the youngsters out there someday will look back in time and seewhat happened to me and what happened to Chris and think, 'That's not really howI want to do things,'"" Benjamin said.___On the Net:The decision is available at:
This editorial appeared in Wednesday's Los Angeles Times:The U.S. Supreme Court's decision Tuesday to bar the execution ofjuvenile murderers has come at a pivotal time in this nation's longand agonized debate over the death penalty.Unlike in the cases of the 100-plus death row defendants releasedin recent years when DNA or other evidence proved them innocent,Christopher Simmons' guilt was not in doubt. Simmons was 17 and aMissouri high school junior when he and a friend entered ShirleyCrook's house, bound the 46-year-old woman with duct tape, drove herto a state park and threw her from a bridge to drown in the waterbelow. Before the crime, Simmons bragged to friends that they would``get away with it'' because they were minors. Soon after his arrest,he not only confessed to Crook's murder but agreed to perform avideotaped re-enactment for police. A jury sentenced him to death.The question before the high court was the fairness and proprietyof Simmons' sentence. Capital punishment is reserved for society'sworst offenders, wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy for a sharply dividedcourt. But because teens are still emotionally immature, they cannotbe held responsible in the same degree as adults for their actions,however unforgivable. For that reason, their execution violates theConstitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment.``The age of 18 is the point where society draws the line for manypurposes between childhood and adulthood,'' Kennedy wrote. ``It is, weconclude, the age at which the line for death eligibility ought torest.''Tuesday's ruling throws out the sentences of 72 murderers in 12 ofthe 20 states that permit capital prosecutions of defendants who wereunder 18 at the time of their crimes. California law reserves thedeath penalty for offenders 18 and over.Opinion polls show Americans softening in their support for thedeath penalty. Learning that so many innocent defendants spent yearson death row before being exonerated has shaken many death penaltyproponents.The high court's new ruling comes three years after it outlawed thedeath penalty for the mentally retarded. Both decisions were pointedlygrounded in what the court describes as a changing national consensuson capital punishment. But, as with the headline-making exonerations,those decisions magnify as well as reflect the public's doubts. Add inmany other obvious inequities -- name a rich person awaitingexecution, for one -- and death row is increasingly revealed for whatit is: a dumping ground for the poorest defendants with the lousiestlawyers rather than the most despicable killers.
In banning capital punishment for juvenile offenderslast week, the Supreme Court once again demonstrated its pivotal rolein domestic and, indeed, world affairs.The 5 to 4 ruling swept aside laws in 20 states that permittedjuries to sentence 16- or 17-year-old murderers to death, thus endingthe United States' status as the last country on Earth that sanctionedthe execution of those who commit crimes when they are younger than18.And, to a large extent, this result was due to a remarkableevolution by a single justice: Anthony Kennedy.It is sometimes said that justices ``grow in office,'' producingopinions and casting votes that confound the expectations of those whoappointed them. Kennedy, 68, a 1988 appointee of President RonaldReagan, has previously shown his unpredictability. He changed his mindin the middle of a crucial 1992 case, casting a fifth vote to upholdRoe v. Wade;@ he disappointed conservatives again with a landmarkpro-gay-rights opinion in 2003.Liberals gnashed their teeth when Kennedy flirted with permittingthe Florida recount to continue in 2000 -- before casting a fifth voteto shut it down and propel George W. Bush into the White House.But it isn't often that a justice reconsiders his past views on amajor issue as thoroughly as Kennedy did last week, when he suppliedthe court's four-justice liberal bloc the fifth vote it needed toabolish the death penalty for juveniles.In 1989, during his first full term, Kennedy voted with afive-justice majority to uphold the death penalty for juvenileoffenders. In that case, Stanford v. Kentucky,@ he joined an opinionby fellow Reagan appointee Antonin Scalia.Reaching the opposite result in last week's case, Roper v.Simmons,@ Kennedy, writing for the majority, argued that times havechanged. The number of states that either have no capital punishmentor do not allow it for offenders under 18 had reached 30 -- evidence,Kennedy wrote, of ``a national consensus'' against the juvenile deathpenalty that had emerged since Stanford.But his opinion also repudiated the legal reasoning he embraced inScalia's opinion 16 years ago.For example, the 1989 opinion calculated ``national consensus''differently, excluding non-death-penalty states from the count; lastweek, Kennedy wrote that Stanford was wrong about that.In 1989, Scalia, with Kennedy's support, wrote there was ``norelevance'' to laws that set 18 or more as the legal age for adultactivities such as drinking and voting -- and that it was ``absurd'' toconsider them.Last week, Kennedy appended to his opinion a list of state lawssetting the age for voting, jury service or marriage without parentalconsent at 18 or above. ``The age of 18 is the point where societydraws the line for many purposes between childhood and adulthood,''Kennedy wrote. ``It is, we conclude, the age at which the line fordeath eligibility ought to rest.''In 1989, Kennedy agreed with Scalia in brushing aside scientificstudies on the relative immaturity of adolescents. Such data could notprove capital punishment fails to deter all 16- and 17-year-olds, orthat juveniles are inherently less morally blameworthy than adults;judgments about deterrence and blameworthiness should be left up tolegislatures and juries, the Scalia-Kennedy opinion said.Last week, though, Kennedy cited ``scientific and sociologicalstudies'' for the proposition that ``it would be misguided to equatethe failings of a minor with those of an adult.'' The weighing of suchfactors could not be left up to juries, Kennedy wrote, because thereis ``an unacceptable likelihood'' that jurors would be``overpower(ed)'' by the brutal details of some teen-age crimes.Kennedy had joined Scalia in 1989 in ``emphatically rejecting'' thesuggestion that the court could apply its ``own informed judgment'' tothe question of whether death is too harsh a punishment for anyjuvenile crime. Last week, he wrote that that part of Stanford hadbeen ``inconsistent with prior ... decisions.''And, although he had joined Scalia in 1989 in ``rejecting thecontention ... that the sentencing practices of other countries arerelevant,'' this time Kennedy wrote that ``it is proper that weacknowledge the overwhelming weight of international opinion againstthe juvenile death penalty.''Not surprisingly, Scalia's dissent in Roper@ last week took aim atKennedy, though not by name.``The votes in today's case demonstrate that the offending ofselected lawyers' moral sentiments is not a predictable basis for law-- much less a democratic one,'' he noted.Invoking the motto that adorns the court's main entrance, Scalia,68, added, ``What kind of Equal Justice under Law is it that -- withoutso much as a 'Sorry about that' -- gives as the basis for sparing oneperson from execution arguments explicitly rejected in refusing tospare another?''But Justice John Paul Stevens, the only member of the court'scurrent liberal bloc who was on the bench in 1989, and who has nowlived to see his dissent in Stanford@ become the law of the land,fired back in defense of Kennedy.Stevens, 84, wrote that if Scalia's view of the Bill of Rights --that its meaning was fixed by the common-law standards of 1791 -- wereto prevail, there would be nothing unconstitutional about theexecution of a 7-year-old child.''(T)hat our understanding of the Constitution does change fromtime to time has been settled since John Marshall breathed life intoits text,'' Stevens wrote.
In striking down the death penalty for juveniles earlier thismonth, the Supreme Court turned a decisive page in a debate that hasraged for years over the role of international law in interpreting theConstitution. Since 1988, the justices have sharply disputed whetherto consider international norms in defining such concepts as ``crueland unusual punishments'' and due process. In Roper vs. Simmons,however, the 5-4 majority resoundingly supported the relevance ofinternational law. And Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's dissentnevertheless agreed that ``the existence of an international consensus... can serve to confirm the reasonableness of a consonant and genuineAmerican consensus.''What a contrast to the prevailing isolationism of the Bushadministration, which recently withdrew from the International Courtof Justice's jurisdiction in response to the ICJ's ruling that theUnited States had violated the consular rights of Mexican nationals ondeath row. Together, these events bring to the fore a dispute that isenduringly provocative, because it pits those who stress theuniqueness of the American constitutional system against those whoemphasize what America shares with the global community. It is adebate that ultimately raises the question of whether America'sstrength lies in its historical independence from the whims of globalsociety or from its leadership role therein.Roper was simply the most recent battleground on which JusticesAntonin Scalia and Stephen Breyer have acted as spokesmen for the twoopposing camps. Scalia has asserted that ``modern foreign legalmaterials can never be relevant to an interpretation of ... themeaning of the U.S. Constitution.'' In this, he is supported byJustice Clarence Thomas, who has protested the court's apparentwillingness to ``impose foreign moods, fads, or fashions onAmericans.'' Both men emphasize the singularity (and superiority) ofthe American system.Breyer and at least five other members of the court, on the otherhand, argue that international norms should inform our constitutionalanalysis in a world increasingly united by globalization,democratization and the spread of universal human rights.The two camps have clashed over such political hot-button issues inAmerica's culture wars as the death penalty, abortion and gay rights.But often overlooked in the debate is the fact that today's justicesare not the first to wrestle with the need to find the appropriatebalance between the two approaches. The question was evident almosttwo centuries ago in a case arising from the War of 1812. ChiefJustice John Marshall, reflecting the Breyer view, wrote that ``Inexpounding (the) Constitution, a construction ought not lightly to beadmitted which would give to a declaration of war an effect in thiscountry it does not possess elsewhere.'' Marshall presumed that theConstitution would incorporate international norms. Indeed, since thenation's founding, the court has often looked to international rulesin a broad range of contexts -- to help define state powers within ourfederal system and to construe the commerce clause, the government'spower over immigrants and the meaning of involuntary servitude and dueprocess.Even the current administration, while prominently flouting many ofour international obligations, has sought sweeping powers frominternational rules that prove convenient. Just last term, the JusticeDepartment argued to the court that the president's authority todetain U.S.-born alleged Taliban fighter Yaser Esam Hamdi derived fromthe international laws of war. The court divided over the argument.Four justices looked to international law both as supporting thepresident's power to detain and as imposing limits on that power.Justices David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg in turn objected to theapparent contradiction in the administration's claim of powersrecognized by the laws of war while failing to provide detainees theprotections afforded by those same rules.The ongoing disagreement over our relationship to international lawreflects fundamentally different attitudes toward America's place inthe international system. Scalia, a stark proponent of Americanconstitutional exceptionalism, looks back to the country's beginningsin urging that ``if there was any thought absolutely foreign to thefounders of our country, surely it was the notion that we Americansshould be governed the way Europeans are.''He is doubtless correct that certain aspects of U.S. constitutionaldesign deliberately rejected the practices of continental Europe.These include our liberal free speech protections and the right tojury trial in civil and criminal cases, which was unknown outside ofGreat Britain at the founding. Both now separate the United Stateseven from British practice.It is incorrect, however, to suggest that our entire constitutionalsystem sets us apart from the international community. The foundersalso worked from the assumption, set forth in the Declaration ofIndependence, that humanity shares a common set of inalienable rights.The drafters of the Constitution were well versed in internationallaw, and they intended the United States to take its place among thecommunity of nations by adhering to international rules. ThomasJefferson considered the law of nations ``an integral part ... of thelaws of the land,'' and John Jay, one of the authors of the FederalistPapers and the first chief justice of the United States, proclaimedthat ``the United States had, by taking a place among the nations ofthe earth, become amenable to the laws of nations.'' Indeed,compliance with international law was critical to prevent thefledgling nation from offending powerful foreign states.Therefore, it would be surprising if the founders expected thegovernment's powers to be construed in isolation from internationalrules. Similarly, the general concepts of individual rights such as``liberty'' and ``cruel and unusual punishments'' that the draftersincorporated into the Constitution reasonably invoke the fundamentalvalues of the international community. In short, while someconstitutional traditions may be unique to the American experience,other aspects of our heritage invite consideration of internationalrules.This dialogue between international and constitutional values hasbeen largely lost to modern jurisprudence, as the use of internationallaw has become a political football in our charged social debates overthe death penalty and gay rights.Each side of the Scalia/Breyer debate today contends that itsapproach does the most to protect fundamental liberties. In reality,however, international law does not point in any particular directionin promoting individual rights. Take abortion as an example:International law, in the form of treaties and customary internationalnorms, is essentially silent on the subject. The practices of foreignnations, on the other hand, run the gamut from absolute prohibition toliberal abortion laws. And while Scalia notes that most countriesaround the world impose greater restrictions on abortion than theUnited States, most advanced industrial democracies broadly protectabortion rights.Abortion, in other words, stands in stark contrast to the juveniledeath penalty: The United States was the only country in the worldthat continued to officially sanction the penalty, and the practiceplaced the United States in the lonely company of such notorious humanrights violators as Yemen and Iran.Scalia frequently criticizes the modern court for selectivelyciting foreign sources that support its views while ignoring practicesabroad that contradict our constitutional norms. And history showsthat international law can be abused. In the 1857 Dred Scott case, thechief justice of that period, Roger B. Taney, infamously invokedforeign practices to conclude that the framers did not intend tobestow citizenship on African descendants. But where internationalrules would have supported freeing Dred Scott from slavery, Taneyrejected their relevance. The fact that international sources -- likeall interpretive sources -- may be abused, however, is an argument thatthey should be used with integrity, not that they should not be usedat all.Over a century ago, the court observed that ``The Constitution ofthe United States was .... made for an undefined and expanding future,and for a people gathered, and to be gathered, from many nations andof many tongues; and while we take just pride in the principles andinstitutions of the common law, we are not to forget that in landswhere other systems of jurisprudence prevail, the ideas and processesof civil justice are also not unknown.''Those who seek to differentiate the American system from theinternational community fail to recognize that the United States is aparticipant in the making of international law, from internationaltrade rules to international humanitarian law.The use of international law does not mean we should follow itblindly. But willfully ignoring those rules both brings the UnitedStates into conflict with other nations, as with the juvenile deathpenalty, and hampers our ability to invoke international rules fromwhich we wish to benefit. International law has been a part of our lawfrom the beginning, and its use in constitutional analysis is part ofthe American tradition.Sarah Cleveland teaches the constitutional law of U.S. foreignrelations at the University of Texas School of Law. She is currentlyresearching the Supreme Court's historical use of international law inconstitutional interpretation. 
Somewhere William J. Brennan is smiling. Not a face-splittingbeam, you understand, because four members of his beloved SupremeCourt still believe it's just fine to execute 16- and17-year-olds. But a pleased, reflected gleam, nonetheless, because the deathpenalty is one small step closer to being removed asthe scourge of a civilized nation that should know better.Thurgood Marshall and Harry Blackmun are, somewhere, smiling, too. But Ifocus on Brennan because it was he, who in 1989near the end of his 34 years as an associatejustice, wrote the blistering dissent as the Supreme Court upheldcapital punishment for adolescents.Brennan featured in his erudite opinion many of the concepts thatseemed settled in Supreme Court analysis until the wrecking crewof William Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas came along.""Evolving standards of decency."" ""Contemporary attitudes."" ""Proportionality."" Brennan also skeweredScalia's ""misplaced disdain"" for scientific evidence, which in the pluralityopinion Scalia had sought to ridicule as ""ethicoscientific.""Well, let's hear it for the ""ethicoscientific.""Because in good measure, that, along with those pesky evolving standards,is exactly what five justices relied on Tuesday, in Roperv. Simmons, to rule that executing 16- and 17-year-olds violatesthe constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.As a leader of the American Psychiatric Association, one of severalmedical groups that favored banning juvenile executions, noted Tuesday, thedecision acknowledges ""that the brains of adolescents function in fundamentallydifferent ways than the brains of adults.""It is an especially important ruling for Texas, which is hometo more than one-third of the nation's death row populationin under-18 cases.It is also another rebuke to the death-penalty zealotry of muchof the state's political establishment.Their enchantment with executing juveniles put them in a very narrowleague that included, until his recent dethronement, Saddam Hussein.In a nice turn of history, as well as a symbolof how close was the vote, the latest opinion waswritten by Justice Anthony Kennedy, a member of Scalia's plurality15 years ago.Sadly and inexplicably, the new majority did not include Justice SandraDay O'Connor, who three years ago joined five other justicesin striking down the death penalty for the mentally retarded.O'Connor attempted -- and failed -- in a dissenting opinion Tuesdayto parse why the social, medical and legal analyses thatapplied and were persuasive enough to her in the mentalretardation case (Atkins v. Virginia) were not met in Roper.Oh, well, opponents of the death penalty may have to learnto live with 5-4, assuming even that narrow count canbe maintained if President Bush, a death-penalty enthusiast, gets tomake a Supreme Court nomination.Little by little, since it reinstated the death penalty in 1976,the Supreme Court has whittled back the administration and applicationof capital punishment.To the Scalias of the world, the idea of ""evolving"" standardsor, even worse to them, an ""evolving"" interpretation of theConstitution, is some sort of perversion (unless, of course, itgets them to their political ends).But as Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in a concurring opinionjoined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, if the meaning ofthe Eighth Amendment ""had been frozen when it was originallydrafted, it would impose no impediment on the execution of7-year-old children.""I'd hesitate to see that proposition brought to a vote inthe Texas Legislature as currently constituted.The Roper case is ""a small tsunami,"" said Jeffrey Fagan, aColumbia University professor of law and public health. ""It's nota 30-foot wall of water but a 2-foot wall. Butthat still is changing the landscape.""Opponents of the death penalty must acknowledge the narrowness of thevote that produced Tuesday's welcomed result in Roper but alsorecognize the modestly advantageous lay of the land.""Proponents of the death penalty haven't had a win in along time,"" Fagan said.one.""The remainder of the journey is not likely to be shortor easy or without setbacks, but with each step andat every turn it will be worthwhile.------(Hines is a Houston Chronicle columnist based in Washington, D.C.

Executing murderers who were under 18 years old at the timeof their crime is unconstitutional, the U.S. Supreme Court ruledTuesday, limiting the scope of capital punishment nationwide for thesecond time in three years.In a 5-4 decision, the justices said a growing consensus amongthe states, and a recognition that minors are not yetfully formed intellectually or morally, led to the conclusion thatexecuting anyone under 18 violates the constitutional ban on crueland unusual punishment.The ruling follows the same path as the court's 2002 decisionthat banned executions of the mentally retarded. It comes lessthan 16 years after the justices issued two rulings onthe same day that upheld the death penalty for 16-and 17-year-olds and the retarded.""The reality that juveniles still struggle to define their identity meansit is less supportable to conclude that even a heinouscrime committed by a juvenile is evidence of irretrievably depravedcharacter,"" said Justice Anthony Kennedy in Tuesday's majority opinion. Comparedto adults, he said, ""a greater possibility exists that aminor's character deficiencies will be reformed.""He noted that American society sets the boundary between childhood andadulthood at 18 in deciding who can vote, serve ona jury or marry without parental consent. That is alsoan appropriate dividing line for those who are subject tothe law's supreme punishment, Kennedy said.Kennedy also said the United States, until Tuesday, was the onlyremaining nation to give official endorsement to executions of juveniles.The United States and Somalia, he said, are the onlynations that have not ratified the United Nations Convention onthe Rights of the Child, which prohibits such executions, andof eight countries that have executed minors since 1990, allbut the United States have abolished or disavowed the practice.His observation reignited a debate over the court's consideration of foreignlaws and legal opinions when interpreting the Constitution. The courthas noted international views in some recent rulings, including its2002 decision on the retarded and its 2003 decision overturningstate sodomy laws. Justice Antonin Scalia, the leading critic ofthe court's practice, noted caustically Tuesday that the majority hasnot followed the same course in rulings on abortion, whereforeign laws are more restrictive.""What these foreign sources 'affirm' ... is the justices' own notionof how the world ought to be,"" Scalia said ina dissenting opinion.Tuesday's ruling overturns laws in 20 states that applied the deathpenalty to minors, and commutes death sentences to life inprison for 73 inmates in 13 of those states--2 percentof the more than 3,400 death row inmates nationwide.The case that led to the ruling involved a Missouri youth,Christopher Simmons, who was 17 in 1993 when he anda friend kidnapped Shirley Crook, bound and gagged her andthrew her off a bridge. Prosecutors said Simmons, who hadno criminal record, told his friends they could get awaywith the killing because of their age.Briefs urging the court to ban juvenile executions were filed bymajor medical and mental-health organizations, the U.S. Conference of CatholicBishops, and several Nobel Peace Prize winners, including former PresidentJimmy Carter.""With this ruling, the United States ... joins the community ofnations, which uniformly renounces this practice,"" Carter said Tuesday.UC Berkeley law professor Franklin Zimring, a death penalty scholar andopponent, said the ruling continued the court's recent trend ofnarrowing capital punishment laws nationwide. The justices may impose furtherrestrictions by scrutinizing procedural flaws and defense lawyers' competence, butare unlikely to decree wholesale changes in the near future,he said.But Mark Levin, president of the conservative Landmark Legal Foundation anda death penalty supporter, said the ruling illustrated judicial activismat its worst. ""I suspect, down the road based onthis reasoning, the court will eventually ban the death penalty,""he added.In overturning its 1989 decision that allowed executions of 16-year-olds, thecourt followed its late-20th century doctrine that judged cruel andunusual punishment by ""evolving standards of decency."" Under that principle,the court has condemned punishments it once tolerated--for example, thedeath penalty for rape, outlawed by a 1977 ruling.Since 1989, Kennedy said, five states have prohibited the death penaltyfor juveniles, no state has lowered its age for executions,and juries have become increasingly reluctant to sentence minors todeath. Counting the 12 states without death penalty laws, hesaid, 30 states now prohibit executions of murderers under 18,the same total that banned executions of the retarded atthe time of the 2002 ruling.Those developments contrast with the popularity of tough-on-crime legislation in generaland a crackdown on juvenile crime in particular, Kennedy said,and ""provide sufficient evidence that today our society views juveniles... as categorically less culpable than the average criminal.""Justice Sandra Day O'Connor dissented, saying she was not persuaded thata national consensus against juvenile executions exists or that jurorswere incapable of singling out a mature, ""especially depraved"" juvenilemurderer for the death penalty. Scalia, in a dissent joinedby Justice Clarence Thomas and Chief Justice William Rehnquist, deridedthe majority for discarding both the court's 1989 ruling anda punishment that was permitted when the Constitution was adoptedtwo centuries earlier.""The court ... proclaims itself sole arbiter of our nation's moralstandards,"" Scalia said, rejecting the notion that the Constitution's meaning""should be determined by the subjective views of five membersof this court and like-minded foreigners.""The case is Roper vs. Simmons, 03-633.
The Supreme Court, concluding that both the United Statesand the world have turned against the death penalty foryouthful offenders, ruled Tuesday that the Constitution categorically bars capitalpunishment for crimes committed before the age of 18.The 5-to-4 decision, which upheld a ruling by the Missouri SupremeCourt, will move 72 people off death row in 12states. It represented an about-face for a court that only16 years ago had rejected the argument that the executionof those who kill at the age of 16 or17 violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against ""cruel and unusualpunishments.""Writing for the court on Tuesday, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, whovoted with the majority 16 years ago, said not onlydid 30 states -- five more than 16 years ago-- reject the death penalty for juveniles, but that ""itis fair to say that the United States now standsalone in a world that has turned its face againstthe juvenile death penalty.""There have been 19 such executions in the United States since1990, most recently in 2003. Once the Supreme Court agreedin January of last year to decide the issue, allexecutions that might be affected by the eventual decision wereput on hold.Justice Antonin Scalia, the author of the court's last ruling onthe subject, Stanford v. Kentucky, filed a dissent from thenew decision in Roper v. Simmons, No. 03-633. Joined byChief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Clarence Thomas, Scaliadisputed nearly every one of the majority's points, from howto count the various states to whether reference to theviews of foreign legal systems has any relevance or legitimacy.The defendant in the case, Christopher Simmons, argued that thesame standards that apply to mentally retarded killers should beapplied to juvenile offenders.The Missouri Supreme Court agreed, noting that five states since 1989,either by legislation or judicial decision, had raised the minimumage to 18. It ordered Simmons resentenced to life inprison without parole.
The Supreme Court, in a decision indicating that itsre-examination of the role of judges in criminal sentencing isfar from over, on Monday overturned a 15-year mandatory sentencethat a federal appeals court had ordered imposed on a""career criminal.""The justices said the appeals court had mistakenly ordered the trialcourt to conduct too wide-ranging an investigation into whether thedefendant's previous convictions met the definition of prior offenses thatwould bring about the mandatory minimum sentence under a federallaw, the Armed Career Criminal Act. The trial judge's roleshould be considerably more limited, the court said in a5-to-3 opinion by Justice David H. Souter.The ruling strongly suggested that the sentencing debate, which earlier thisyear produced a decision that effectively amended the federal sentencingguidelines on the ground that they gave judges too muchauthority, will now take aim at a different target: prioroffenses.In 2000, when the court ruled in Apprendi v. New Jerseythat the Constitution barred judges from making factual findings thatled to increased sentences, the justices carved out one exception:findings that related to prior offenses.Federal statutes and those in many states impose greater, often mandatory,sentences based on a defendant's prior record, so an interpretationof that record can often be the most important partof the sentencing process. Ever since the Apprendi decision, therehas been growing tension between the rule the court announcedand the one exception it maintained.The question in the case ruled Monday was whether four burglariesto which Reginald Shepard had earlier pleaded guilty qualified asthe kind of prior offenses that made him eligible forthe 15-year mandatory minimum sentence imposed on felons who areconvicted of possession of firearms.Under the federal law, a burglary of a house or otherstructure counted toward the minimum, while a burglary of acar or boat did not.Shepard had pleaded guilty to the burglaries, but the plea agreementdid not contain the necessary details about the crimes. Consequently,the U.S. District Court in Boston refused the government's requestfor the 15-year mandatory minimum on the ground that theprosecution had not demonstrated that the burglaries were the relevantkind. Shepard received a three-year sentence instead.On the government's appeal, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,also in Boston, instructed the district court to look forfurther evidence about the burglaries, including examining the original policereports that formed the basis for the prosecutor's complaint. Ina subsequent decision, it ordered the district court to imposethe mandatory minimum sentence.In his opinion overturning the appeals court's decision, Souter said theSupreme Court's most relevant precedent, as well as more recentdevelopments -- a reference to the Apprendi decision -- meantthat the trial judge's inquiry should be limited to officialcourt records. In cases involving plea bargains, he said, thatmeant the judge could look at the transcript of theplea agreement or related findings of fact, but could notgo beyond the court files to look at police reports.In a concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas said the time hadcome to take up a direct challenge to the Apprendiexception. ""Innumerable criminal defendants have been unconstitutionally sentenced under theflawed rule"" that the court has maintained, he said.In a dissenting opinion, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said the decision,Shepard v. United States, No. 03-9168, made ""little sense"" andwould ""substantially frustrate Congress' scheme for punishing repeat violent offenderswho violate federal gun laws."" O'Connor said that it wasa ""commonsense inference"" that Shepard's admitted burglaries had occurred inbuildings and that there was no reason to presume thatthe state courts that accepted his guilty pleas had violatedtheir duty to inform themselves that his pleas had afactual basis.O'Connor, whose opinion was joined by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy andJustice Stephen G. Breyer, noted that she had been adissenter from the Apprendi decision and subsequent rulings that expandedon it. ""It is a battle I have lost,"" shesaid.She said the court was now moving ""into new territory thatApprendi and succeeding cases had expressly and consistently disclaimed.""O'Connor added, ""Today's decision reads Apprendi to cast a shadow possiblyimplicating recidivism determinations, which until now had been safe fromsuch formalism.""Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist did not take part in thiscase.There were these other developments at the court on Monday:JUVENILE DEATH PENALTYThe court set aside death sentences for six men on deathrow in four states for crimes they committed before theage of 18. The actions, certain to be followed byothers, were necessitated by the court's ruling last week inRoper v. Simmons that the execution of those who committedcrimes as juveniles violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against crueland unusual punishments. Three of the six were from Texas,while the others were from Virginia, Alabama and Mississippi.PRISONERS' SUITSThe court ruled by a vote of 8-1 that state prisonerschallenging parole procedures or other procedural aspects of prison lifecan use a Reconstruction-era civil rights statute to get intofederal court rather than the considerably more restrictive habeas corpusstatute. Breyer wrote the opinion in Wilkinson v. Dotson, No.03-287, and Kennedy was the lone dissenter.The distinction the court drew Monday, while technical, has considerable practicalimportance for prisoners. The decision affirmed a ruling by the6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Cincinnati, which Ohioprison officials had appealed to the Supreme Court.In order to file a habeas corpus petition, which challenges theconstitutionality of a conviction or sentence, a prisoner must firstexhaust any procedures the state might offer. But there isno such requirement for going directly to federal court underthe Civil Rights Act of 1871, better known as Section1983. Breyer said that prisoners bringing a challenge that, ifsuccessful, would simply get them a hearing or other proceduralremedy should not be forced to use habeas corpus becausethey were not seeking the relief that habeas corpus provides,namely their freedom.
When the U.S. Supreme Court decides to overturn the laws of20 states, theAmerican people have every reason to expect that the judicial decisionhas firm grounding in the Constitution.Citizens might also hope that if the justices decide to overrulethe duly elected representatives of the people, the lawmaking processin the states and its own precedent, that the constitutionalissues would be so crystalline as to elicit a unanimousor near-unanimous decision.In its recent ruling in Roper v. Simmons, five Supreme Courtjustices have failed miserably to meet either of the abovestandards. In determining that 16- and 17-year-old murderers cannot, underany circumstances, face the death penalty, Justices Anthony Kennedy, RuthBader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, David Souter and John Paul Stevenshave established a dangerous precedent for judicial activism.As a resident of Texas, which leads the nation in executions,I believe we put too many people to death. Toparaphrase a famous quote about another deeply divisive moral issue,the death penalty should be lethal, legal and rare, soughtby prosecutors in only the most extreme cases.It naturally follows that the death penalty for minors should beeven more rare. Under what circumstances and when murderers inTexas face the death penalty is, however, a matter forTexas lawmakers and courts to decide.The Supreme Court has arrogated this power to itself, creating forTexas juries the legal fallacy that they may only sentenceto life imprisonment -- effectively, 40 years -- someone whowas 17 years, 364 days old at the time ofa horrendous capital crime, while an accomplice only a fewdays older can face the executioner's needle.The court had already addressed this fallacy in its 1989 Stanfordv. Kentucky decision, upholding the exceptional application of the deathpenalty for capital crimes committed at age 16 and 17.What compelled the five justices to reverse that decision in2005?Kennedy's majority opinion cites the necessity of referring to ""the evolvingstandards of decency"" that lead to an emerging ""national consensus""against the death penalty for minors. Let's consider Kennedy's statisticalcase.Count the 12 states that lack capital punishment in any formalong with the 18 states that prohibit the death penaltyfor minor murderers and you have a resounding consensus --a synonym for unanimity -- of exactly three-fifths.Here the justices wander into a judicial morass on other issuesin which states show a greater semblance of national consensus.Take, for example, gay marriage, which one state has legalized,while 38 states have passed laws that restrict marriage tothe union of one man and one woman.Should or would the Supreme Court freeze the current consensus intime and render unconstitutional the efforts of gays and lesbiansto seek marital rights in their respective states? And whatof the true consensus in 1973 of all 50 statesto restrict abortions to lesser or greater degrees?Set aside for a moment the merits of a ruling basedon the arbitrary interpretation of national consensus. The most disturbingaspect of the court's decision is its reliance on 'theoverwhelming weight of international opinion."" That is to say, fivejustices feel their power to interpret world sentiment and fabricatea national consensus supersedes the right of juries to deliververdicts and assess penalties in accordance with the laws oftheir states.Where in all this, one may reasonably ask, is our nation'sConstitution?What activist justices on the Supreme Court are effectively telling theAmerican people is, 'Heads we win, tails you lose."" Ifthe legislative process advances an agenda the justices support ideologically,they'll speed it along with a judicial decree based onrights not found in the Constitution.If the same process advances an agenda the justices oppose, they'llquash it on the basis of an imaginary national consensusof five men and women and their reading of internationalpublic opinion, irrespective of the Constitution.(E-mail: jgurwitz@express-news.net)
